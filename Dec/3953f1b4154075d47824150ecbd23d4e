Golf Park’s Tony Omuli fired three under par 69 to take an early first round lead in the fourth leg of the Kenya Open Golf Limited-sponsored Safari Tour at the par 72 Thika Greens Golf resort on Sunday. His round included a bogey-free first nine, holding par on the first seven holes followed by consecutive birdies on the Par-four eighth and Par-four ninth holes for his 34. At the back nine, Omuli started off with consecutive birdies on the 10th and 11th before dropping shots at the Par-four 12th and the short hole 14th. He held on with par up to the home green where he birdied for a 35. Omuli said that he was happy with his performance after the first round adding that there was still more work to be done in the remaining rounds. “It was a good opening round today and I am pleased with the performance. The course is long and challenging. There is still a lot of golf to be played in the remaining rounds so a lot can change in the process. I intend to maintain my focus throughout the tournament with the hope of winning my first Safari Tour title,” he said. Meanwhile, Railway Golf Club's Alfred Nandwa, Mumias Sugar’s Dismas Indiza and Nyali’s Njuguna Ngugi finished the round tied second after returning two under par 70 each. Muthaiga’s Greg Snow, who topped both the second and third legs at Vet Lab and Limuru, ended the round tied in sixth with a level par score. Action was still on at the time of writing in the Sh1 million event which was teed off by a Pro-Am event on Saturday. The Safari Tour, which is aimed at preparing the local pros for the forthcoming Kenya Open in March and international events, is open to professionals.
