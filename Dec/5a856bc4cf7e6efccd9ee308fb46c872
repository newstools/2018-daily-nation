The Supreme Court has upheld Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua's election victory, rejecting a petition challenging the vote. The judges on Friday ruled that Dr Mutua was validly elected. Dr Mutua's 2017 election win was challenged by his rival Wavinya Ndeti, who argued the process was marred by irregularities. Ms Ndeti said IEBC announced results that did not reflect the voting that took place. High Court Judge Aggrey Muchelule dismissed Ms Ndeti’s petition but the appellate court overturned the decision, faulting the returning officer for using the wrong form. While arguing before the Supreme Court, Dr Mutua through lawyer Kioko Kilukumi admitted that the returning officer made a “slight deviation” and used an excel spreadsheet to collate and announce the results. ELECTION FORMS However, he added, the deviation does not take away the constitutional test of verifiability of the results. “There was no finding by the trial court that the data was fraudulent, inflated or otherwise fictitious. All the forms were signed by among others, Wiper agents,” Mr Kilukumi. Mr Kilukumi said the signing of the electoral forms is not an “idle exercise” but signifies adding that the returning officer only used the spreadsheet for efficiency and accuracy and that it was sanctioned by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The apex court at the same time dismissed election petitions against Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya and Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter. More follows.
