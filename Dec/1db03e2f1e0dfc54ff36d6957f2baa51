Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has raised the alarm over the recent spike in the murder and defilement cases in Kisii County. He cited Marani and Sameta sub-counties as those grappling with a high prevalence of defilement cases and called for action from regional security chiefs. Speaking when he visited Governor James Ongwae, Dr Matiang’i said many of the murder cases are related to land disputes. He called for collaboration between the agencies, village elders and church leaders in addressing the vices. "The situation appears to be getting out of hand and we must act. Let there be conversations that can help us get to the root cause of the problems so that we end this madness once and for all," Dr Matiang’i said. HIRE CHIEFS The CS also said that the government will hire chiefs in locations that have not had them for a long time. “I know there has been anxiety on this but soon we will be able to sort it out," Dr Matiang’i said. On the war against illicit brews, Dr Matiang’i said there efforts to ensure the vice is addressed. He said a recent survey showed a steep rise in drug and alcohol abuse among the youth. He called for coordinated efforts to eradicate the vice, adding that that the government will do more in addressing the vice. "There is going toll be no reverse gear on this. We risk having a destroyed future generation if we fail to safeguard our youth from these things," the CS said. He said that the government will also build a rehabilitation centre in the region as part of the efforts aimed at tackling drug abuse.
