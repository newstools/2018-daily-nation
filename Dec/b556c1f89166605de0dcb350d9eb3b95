The Supreme Court has upheld the election of Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter. In March, the High Court in Eldoret had nullified Mr Keter’s election, saying that it marred by malpractices and irregularities. This followed a petition by independent candidate Benard Kibor Kitur. But on Friday, the apex court upheld Mr Keter’s election in the August 8, 2017 elections. Other MPs whose victories have been upheld include Gideon Konchella of Kilgoris and John Oyioka of Bonchari. KETER VALIDLY ELECTED In the Nadni Hills case, the court found that Mr Keter was validly elected and dismissed Mr Kitur's petition who had cited violence, intimidation of voters and agents during the campaigns and on Election Day as well as voter bribery during the polls. Speaking after the ruling, Mr Keter said he was elected in accordance with law and that the 2018 elections were free and fair. He blamed his predicaments on his enemies whom he said are not happy with his outspokenness. FIGHT GRAFT “My detractors must know that I’m back in parliament in full swing.
