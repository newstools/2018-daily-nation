At least seven passengers died on Tuesday when the matatu they were travelling in collided with a truck on Eldoret-Nakuru highway. Witnesses said the driver of the truck, which had maize, had been trying to overtake at a sharp corner when the crash occurred at Mlango Tatu. Police at the scene reported collecting seven bodies, a number which Rift Valley Traffic Enforcement Officer Zero Arome confirmed. Mr Arome said the drivers of the two vehicles were among those who died. The injured were taken to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital and the wreckage to a nearby police station.              Africa has the worst rate of road traffic deaths in the world, says WHO.
