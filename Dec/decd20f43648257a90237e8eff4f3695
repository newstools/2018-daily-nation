Elections always bring out the worst in Kenyans but, ideally, they should not. The violence, acidic ethnic rivalry, animosity and confusion only end up undermining the people’s right to freely determine their leaders. But elections remain the most effective way of either endorsing incumbents or, if they have performed below par, passing on the baton to a new individual or team with fresh ideas to make a difference in society. That opportunity has come for the elite group that leads the 47 counties to pick whom among them they should bestow the chairmanship of the Council of Governors (CoG) to. True, even these governors must still be reeling from the fatigue of last year’s General Election, when some of them were elected for their second and final five-year term and the new ones won mandates after bruising battles to unseat their predecessors. The CoG has proved to be an asset in the effort to deepen devolution. Through it, governors seek to articulate the concerns and aspirations of counties while not shackled by partisan considerations. Indeed, the governors have demonstrated an unflinching commitment to making devolution work. Lately, we have seen the CoG come out to question the medical equipment leasing scheme through which counties have been saddled with hefty loan repayments without being consulted. A stronger CoG also provides a forum through which neighbouring counties can forge economic blocs to drive economic prosperity. We are not surprised, therefore, that there is intense lobbying ahead of the election of the new CoG chairman. This is a first among equals, whose place as the de facto leader of devolution is pivotal. A transparent election is the best way to strengthen the council by maintaining harmony and co-operation among governors to entrench devolution.
