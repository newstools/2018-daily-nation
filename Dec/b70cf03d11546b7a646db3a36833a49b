Kakamega Homeboyz walked away with the bragging rights in the 'Ingo Derby' after humiliating AFC Leopards 3-0 at Bukhungu Stadium on Saturday. Peter Thiong'o was the destroyer-in-chief for the hosts opening the scoring in the 14th minute before setting up Maxwell Ravel and George Mandela to score in the second half. The result leaves Ingwe without a win this season after settling for a 1-1 draw with Kariobangi Sharks in the season opener. Homeboyz Coach Paul Nkata was happy with his charges for turning in a tireless display. “The players fought well. They deserved to win as they displayed a well co-ordinated game,” said the Ugandan. AFC Leopards tactician Marko Vasiljevic admitted his charges were second best. “We played well. Our opponents, however, used their home ground properly to nail us. I will strive to improve all the departments that let us down,” he noted. Homeboyz dominated both halves and they could have won by a bigger margin had they utilized all their chances.   Thiong'o opened the scoring in the 13th minute after he beat defender Robinson Kamura to the ball and sent his finish past a full-stretch Jairus Adira A counter attack by Ingwe forwards Said Tsuma, Brian Marita and Baker Lukooya proved futile as they were kept at bay by a strong defence marshalled by Benjamin Oketch. Referee Japheth Juma was forced to book Moses Chikati in the 45th minute for appending Eugene Mukangala. Homeboyz sought to stretch their lead and Thiong'o was once again the architect squaring the ball into the path of Ravel who made no mistake from close range to make it 2-0 on 67 minutes. Nkata substituted David Odhiambo for Allan Wanga to reinforce his attack while Vasiljevic introduced Marvin Omondi for Aziz Odeny. George Mandela completed the rout after being fed by Thiong'o in a fluid counter attacking move in the 72nd minute.
