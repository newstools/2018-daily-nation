Politics may have taken centre stage as large crowds turned out in Kisumu yesterday to welcome President Uhuru Kenyatta, but equally important was his healthcare mission. Close to the President’s heart and a key engagement of First Lady Margaret Kenyatta is the expansion of quality health services. This is, indeed, one of the four pillars of the President’s ‘Big Four’ agenda, and the basis of the First Lady’s Beyond Zero programme, which is quite visible in all the 47 counties. Even as he talked politics with former arch-rival-turned-ally Raila Odinga, dwelling on their March 9 handshake that has been pivotal in forging national reconciliation, the President was out marketing his Universal Health Coverage. COST He is keen to see as many Kenyans as possible access medical care, which is a big challenge with the rising cost of medication. The high cost presents a huge problem for the majority poor. Thankfully, the UHC is being partly funded by the World Bank with Sh2 billion and is on course, now being piloted in Kisumu, Nyeri, Machakos and Isiolo. The UHC seeks to enhance access to medical services through the National Hospital Insurance Fund. The involvement of many volunteer community health workers to mobilise NHIF registration is laudable. GRAFT However, as with other donor-supported schemes, there is a genuine worry about the sustainability of the programme. Some experts are warning about loopholes that could be exploited for the looting of resources, which has become endemic in the public sector. Another challenge is lack of adequate qualified personnel to co-ordinate the services. The onus is on the health officials to ensure that drug thefts and other challenges are stemmed to increase access to healthcare for the majority poor.
