A man and his daughter who were arrested over the killing of a Nanyuki businessman will spend the next two weeks in police custody after a court granted detectives more time to conclude investigations. Mr Charles Macharia and his daughter Ms Jane Wanjiku are being held over the brutal murder of Nanyuki-based trader George Gachibi that occurred on Monday night. The duo, who are facing robbery with violence charges, were presented at the Nanyuki Law Courts on Thursday but failed to take plea as police sought more time to complete investigations. Hundreds of locals thronged the court precincts just to catch a glimpse of the suspects. Gachibi was the proprietor of Checkers Bar and Restaurant in Nanyuki town. Nanyuki Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss Jacob Muriithi told the court that some crucial findings yet to be finalised while some forensic analyses are still pending.   Suspects found with Mr Gachibi's Subaru Legacy car and electronics stolen from him.
