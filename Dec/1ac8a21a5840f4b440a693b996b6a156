Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i and Immigration Director Gordon Kihalangwa have withdrawn an application at the Court of Appeal challenging a court order that they pay Sh200,000 fine for defying a court order. Justice George Odunga fined the two for deporting lawyer Miguna Miguna despite a court order requiring that they produce him in court. Mr Miguna was forcefully bundled into a plane and taken to Canada being detained in solitary cell at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport early this year. Lawyers Dr John Khaminwa, James Orengo, Otiende Amolo, Julie Soweto and Nelson Havi challenged the move and urged the court to find the two government officials guilty of contempt of court. Justice Odunga found them guilty and ordered them to pay Sh200,000 each from their April 2018 salaries. On Tuesday, Dr Khaminwa asked judges Alnashir Visram Roselyn Nambuye and Jamila Mohammed to inquire whether Dr Matiang'i and Mr Kihalangwa have paid the fines. But there was no immediate confirmation of payment.   The State will appeal Justice Enoch Chacha Mwitaâ€™s December 14 decision.
