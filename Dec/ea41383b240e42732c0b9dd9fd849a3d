The Kenya Ports Authority and Equity Bank teams are the winners of the men’s and women’s 2018 Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League titles, respectively. KPA successfully defended their men’s crown for a third straight year, defeating Ulinzi Warriors 3-0 in the best-of-five playoff final. Equity recaptured the women’s title when they beat KPA 3-1, also in the best-of-five playoff final. However, there is still a lot to be done to improve the league and attract sponsorship. The success of the league will clearly be manifested in the kind of national team the country will have. The last time the KBF Premier League attracted sponsors was almost four years ago, when SuperSport sponsored the semi-finals and final play-offs.  The quality of officiating and the lengthy leagues should also be addressed. The premier leagues have gone on without most of the qualified referees, who opted to stay away or go on a go-slow over unpaid allowances. This left the league at the mercy of lower-tier referees. Playing matches outdoors also compromises quality. Save for the semi-finals and finals, the league matches were played outdoors at the United States International University, Nairobi. KBF should pay for an indoor arena if places such as Nyayo National Stadium are not available. It goes without saying that basketball at the grassroots is dying pretty fast. Save for the KPA teams, which are from Mombasa, all the big teams are from Nairobi. Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the country and, therefore, needs to have a credible and competent office that can put in place a credible structure to woo sponsors.
