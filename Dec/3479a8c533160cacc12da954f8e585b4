A 15-year-old Class Five pupil from Kakamega County is nursing injuries after she was sexually assaulted by an uncle who then slashed her with a panga on Sunday. Villagers said the suspect aged 26 armed himself with a panga and confronted the girl who was returning from a neighbour’s compound to collect a mobile phone. On her way back, she met the suspect who threatened to attack her if she did not hand over the device. A neighbour who helped the girl said, “The man grabbed the girl and dragged her into a house in the compound and locked her there, threatening to kill her if she screamed for help." SCREAMS The girl was rescued by villagers who responded to her screams for help. The suspect had slashed her fingers and other parts of her body using the panga. “He locked me in the house and then defiled me and started slashing me with the panga, injuring my fingers and other parts of my body,” said the pupil. The suspect fled the scene but was later arrested and is expected to appear in court. Villagers said the man has been behaving strangely and waylays women and girls going to collect firewood in the nearby bush or fetch water from the river. “He has become a big threat to our children and women. We are asking the local administration and law enforcers to ensure he is charged for the offences he has committed,” said an elderly woman from the village. Kakamega East OCPD Robert Makau said the suspect is facing a separate robbery charge. “We have him in custody and he will be charged for the offences committed,” said Mr Makau.
