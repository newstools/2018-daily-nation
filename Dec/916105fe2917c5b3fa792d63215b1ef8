The government has imposed dusk-to-dawn curfew in Ololoipang’i, Nkoben Osananguriri and Oloruasi areas of Narok South after clashes leave one dead and eight injured. Narok County Commissioner George Natembeya, who on Sunday led a security team that visited the affected villages, announced the curfew as the government seeks to restore order in the violence prone area. “I want to urge you all to remain indoors between 6pm and 6 am. Nobody should be found outside within those hours,” said Mr Natembeya. Mr Natembeya revealed that General Service Unit and Rapid Deployment Unit officers have been deployed to the areas. “We have deployed security personnel from RDU and GSU to reinforce teams on the ground as the clashes seem to escalate. We want to deal with masterminds of the clashes,” said Mr Natembeya. The injured are nursing arrow wounds in various hospitals in the region, including the Narok County Referral Hospital. The standoff between Kipsigis and Maasai communities erupted on Friday night and is suspected to have been sparked by the stealing of a cow at Ololoipang’i. The affected areas are Ololoipang’i, Nkoben Osananguriri and Oloruasi.   Narok County Commissioner George Natembeya links violence to a cattle theft incident.
