Detectives have arrested two suspects in Isiolo town over alleged possession of fake foreign currency and seven gold bars weighing five kilograms. The two suspects, Mr Abdi Wario and Abdullahi Hassan, were being held at Isiolo Police Station but are now at county commander's office for questioning. A bank official has been called to verify the authenticity of the foreign currency after a man went to the station claiming the cash belongs to him. Isiolo County Commissioner John Ondego confirmed the arrest. "Mr Abdi Mohamed, aged 24 and Mr Abdullah Hassan Golle, aged 23 were arrested yesterday evening [Sunday] in Isiolo by detectives for being in possession of several suspected bundles of fake Euro currencies and seven metal bars of suspected gold weighing 5 kilograms," the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said on its Twitter handle.
