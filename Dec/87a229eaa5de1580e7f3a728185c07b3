Three people, including lawyer Tom Ojienda, will be charged with financial misappropriation and fraudulent dealings at Mumias Sugar Company, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji now says. Besides Prof Ojienda who was arrested on Friday afternoon, the DPP has also ordered the arrest and prosecution of the miller’s former finance director Peter Kibati and former company secretary Emily Otieno. “This inquiry file relates to allegations of use of fake court proceedings, number and parties spread across the country in different courts that were used by several legal service providers to obtain monies, as legal fees, from Mumias Sugar Company,” the DPP said in a statement. According to Mr Haji, Sh89 million was paid in fraudulent schemes. “Senior Counsel, Prof Tom Ojienda, was one of the advocates involved with the assistance of former officers of Mumias Sugar Company,” said Mr Haji. 'MALICE' Mr Ojienda has, however, denied the accusations against him saying they reek of malice and bad faith. In a statement posted in one of his WhatsApp campaign groups for re-election in the powerful and influential Judicial Service Commission (JSC) as the lawyers' representative, Mr Ojienda denied having ever conspired to defraud the sugar company through fake cases. “I have read the Director of Public Prosecution's statement with utter shock and disbelief. I would like to state without any fear of contradiction that I do not, I cannot and I have never filed a fake case. I have never conspired with any person to be paid for work not done,” Mr Ojienda said in statement posted early Saturday morning.   Senior Counsel Tom Ojienda says DPP's planned charges against him sound like a big joke and are based on bad faith.
