Athletics Kenya has announced that coaches intending to work in the country in 2019 will have to register at Riadha House on January 9. In a statement sent to newsrooms, AK said that they have requested both local and foreign residing and working in the country to present their permits and certificate to their offices on the said date. The federation says the exercise is meant to have all coaches operating in the country have appropriate qualifications to handle Kenyan athletes. Coaches who will be out of the country will be given a second opportunity to present their papers at a later date. “Failure to present oneself for this important exercise will force the federation to work with other government agencies to have disciplinary action taken against them,” the statement read in part. AK has already met and vetted most registered athletes’ representatives and managers. AK president Jackson Tuwei said that they have registered eight new athletes’ representative and managers taking the total number operating in the country to 46. He however says that the new athletes representatives and managers are yet to be fully vetted. “They have to sit for special examination from IAAF for them to get fully certification. Tuwei explained that athletes’ representatives and managers form an integral part in the fight against doping menace. “This process is well defined by the Athletics Integrity Unit of the IAAF,” said Tuwei. The federation has also started registering athletes in the country. No athlete will be cleared to compete in any competition without the requisite registration, AK has said.
