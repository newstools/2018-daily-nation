Former champions Kabras Sugar and Nondescripts upheld their virtuoso start to the season, claiming their third consecutive victories as Kenya Cup hit the third leg on Saturday. Kabras Sugar, the 2015/2016 champions, went for the scalp and jugular of visiting Nakuru side, walloping them 50-8 at the Kakamega Showground, while Nondies stopped Menengai Oilers 28-0 at the Impala Sports Club. Defending champions Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) bounced back from the previous 27-22 defeat by Nondies to hand Mwamba their third successive defeat 33-13 at the Lion’s Den in Ruaraka. Impala Saracens also upheld their winning start to the season to condemn Strathmore Leos to their third consecutive defeat 16-9 at the Impala Sports Club. Hosts Blak Blad proved superior in the varsity derby, beating visiting University of Nairobi’s Mean Machine 32-19 at the Kenyatta University ground. Kenya Harlequin recovered from the 14-8 defeat to Menengai Oilers to silence Homeboyz 35-15 at the RFUEA grounds. At Impala, fly-half Martin Juma gave Nondies a 6-3 lead at the drinks from two penalties. Then tries from eighth-man Ian Mumbwa, flanker Fidel Oloo and substitute William Otieno sealed victory for Nondies but not before Juma’s third penalty. Kabras Sugar landed eight tries to annihilate Nakuru. Felix Ayange touched down a hat-trick of tries while Ugandan international Philip Wokorach landed a brace to spur Kabras Sugar to victory. Brian Tanga, Fabian Olando and Paul Abucho also scored a try each for Kabras Sugar. The victory saw Kabras Sugar claim their third consecutive bonus point to stretch their lead to 15 points as Nondies stayed second with 13 points followed by Impala also on 13 but on inferior points difference.   Shujaa finished last in the event alongside their continental rivals Zimbabwe.
