Sofapaka battled to a 2-2 draw against Ulinzi Stars in a SportPesa Premier League match played at Afraha Stadium, Machakos on Saturday. Batoto Ba Mungu wasted glorious scoring opportunities in a match that they would have easily pocketed maximum points.The 2009 league champions took the lead in 30th minute when Ulinzi custodian James Saruni failed to stop with a fierce Dennis Omino shot for a 1-0 halftime lead. Ulinzi came back from the break a rejuvenated side launching a series of raids on Sofapaka’s goal. They nearly equalized on 55th minute when Enosh Ochieng booted the ball into the stands with an empty goal at his mercy. Ochieng redeemed himself eight minutes later when he rose he scored with a glancing header from Oliver Ruto’s cross past Richard Aimo. He completed his brace three minutes later with a powerful volley from the edge of the box. The Soldiers were coasting to victory when an uncharacteristic error by Saruni gifted John Avire with an equalizer in the dying minutes of the match. The Ulinzi custodian drifted off his line but failed to deal with an aerial allowing Avire to tap home into an empty net. Ulinzi coach Dunstan Nyaudo blamed his side’s loss of concentration for the dropped points. “Our defence went to sleep in the last minutes and Soafapaka punished us by getting the equalizer,” he said. A visibly disappointed Sofapaka head coach Medo Melis snubbed post-match interview and disappeared into the dressing room.
