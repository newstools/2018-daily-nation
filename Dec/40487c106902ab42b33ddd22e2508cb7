Bandari dispatched Sofapaka 2-1 in an exciting SportPesa Premier League match at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos County on Sunday. Hosts Sofapaka saw a solitary goal half-time lead slip in this game, as youthful Bandari coach Bernard Mwalala maintained his 100 percent record by chalking his second consecutive win of the 2018/2019 campaign. Kepha Aswani gave Sofapaka the lead in the opening minute of the game and it seemed as if it would be a good day for Batoto Ba Mungu. But then the coastal side staged a comeback and got the important goals through Yema Mwana and Wycliffe Ochomo in the last 20-minutes of the game.
