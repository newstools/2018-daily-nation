The National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) General Assembly this week declined to adopt the 2016/2017 accounts for the second time, calling for a 14-day grace period to peruse through the document before passing it. The move by the General Assembly is commendable since the affiliates had not been given the document on time. These finances are crucial as they touch on the thorny issue of the stalled construction of Nock Plaza in Upper Hill, Nairobi, and the double allocation of Olympic Committee’s land near the Carnivore Restaurant. While a solution might have been reached on the stalled building, Nock president Paul Tergat acknowledges that it’s still a delicate situation. We hope that the Building and Property Committee led by Waithaka Kioni, who is also the Nock vice-president, will resolve the long-running matter. Nock affiliates should also support Nock’s move to come up with structural changes at its secretariat to professionalise operations. Having professionals running the finance, administration, projects and communications docket will see the operations at Nock being run according to international standards. The organisation has in the past faced various scandals, and high standards of transparency and accountability are crucial. However, without the passage of the accounts, it means that the Nock’s budget that stretches to the year 2020 is stuck. The next few months will be also crucial for sports federations as they try to qualify their disciplines for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
