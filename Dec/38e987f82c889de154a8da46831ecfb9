Police arrested a father and his daughter on Tuesday over the murder of a businessman in Nanyuki, Laikipia County. Via Twitter, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said Charles Macharia and his daughter Jane Wanjiku were found with the victim's car and electronics at their home in Gatanga. SWIFT ACTION "Detectives acted swiftly on receiving information about the stolen car and laid an ambush. After a short while, it was spotted being driven to a petrol station in Kirwara, Gatanga. The driver, Charles Macharia, was arrested," the DCI said. "The vehicle and all items stolen from the deceased were recovered." Police said Ms Wanjiku works as a waitress at a hotel in Nanyuki.   Murder cases have been reported in several parts of the country in the last few months. They have ranged from the killing of spouses, children, parents and friends after minor arguments, to targeted crimes by gangs that have asked for ransom. The cases have shone the light on the death penalty in Kenya. In December last year, the Supreme Court declared Section 204 of the Penal Code, which covers the mandatory death sentence, as unconstitutional. However, the top court specified that this decision did not affect the validity of the death sentence. The decision meant death sentence is still lawful but not mandatory. Murder and robbery with violence are the offences in the Kenyan criminal law that attract a death penalty.   She pleaded not guilty to the two counts of murder.
