Supporters of singer-cum-politician Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine held a protest on Friday afternoon in Bugembe Town Council paralysing traffic on the Jinja-Iganga Highway. The supporters of the Kyadondo East legislator were protesting police’s banning of Mr Kyagulanyi's concert that had been slated for Boxing Day at his One Love Beach in Busabala. Bobi Wine’s supporters had planned a press conference at Bridge Way Hotel in Jinja on Friday morning but they cancelled it after realising that police were closely monitoring their activities. They changed the venue to Victoria Panorama Hotel in Walukuba- Masese Division in Jinja where they briefed journalists in the afternoon before holding their protest in Bugembe Town Council. They used burning car tyres and logs to block the road, cutting off traffic on the Jinja-Iganga High way. Armed Police officers had to swing into action to disperse them. Mr Epaphras Kibugudhom, one of the protestors, said Mr Kyagulanyi should be allowed to do his work just like other professionals in Parliament. “If MPs who are lawyers, doctors are doing their work, what about Bobi Wine who is a musician? If President [Yoweri Museveni goes to Rwakitura every weekend to his farm, what about the musician who sings songs which mobilise people not to be violent while fighting for their rights?’’ Mr Kibugudho asked. This comes after Ugandan police quelled protests in parts of Kampala, including Kamwokya where protesters burnt car tyres and logs to block roads. On December 16, police also blocked the artiste from performing at Queen’s Palace in Jinja and arrested several of his fans.   Uganda's opposition leader in Parliament Betty Ochana says police action unacceptable and unethical.
