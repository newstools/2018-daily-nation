A meeting between Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga and Msambweni lawmaker Suleiman Dori has elicited mixed reactions, as it came a day after the party's disciplinary committee recommended his expulsion. On Tuesday, Mr Odinga chaired a meeting that adopted a report recommending the expulsion of Ms Jumwa, Mr Dori, and seven ward representatives — six from Homa Bay and one from Busia. COURTESY CALL Ms Jumwa and Mr Dori, who were both elected on an ODM ticket in the 2017 elections, were accused of disloyalty after they declared their support for Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 State House bid. They will plead their cases before the party National Executive Council in 2019. On Wednesday, the Msambweni legislator paid his party leader a courtesy call at his offices. Mr Odinga posted on his official Twitter handle that “Met a section of leaders from the coastal region led by Hon. Suleiman Dori at Capitol Hill Square and was later joined by Suleiman Shahbal who paid me a courtesy call [sic]." Mr Dori visited with Coast MPs Ali Mbogo (Kisauni) and Owen Baya (Kilifi North). Suna East MP Junet Mohammed also attended the meeting. THE REACTIONS Twitter users who commented on Mr Odinga's message wondered why he met the politician yet the committee wants him out. “[Is that] the same Suleiman Dori ODM wants out?” posed Oscar Ochieng. Others claimed Mr Dori sought his party leader's help in preventing the punishment. “Hata wakiomba msamaha wacha wakwende huko. Wanainchi wamewakataa (Even if they ask for forgiveness, do not let them back in. The people have rejected them),” said Nich Oduor. Hezekiah asked, “What’s going on? Baba (Raila), This time round you have confused me completely. What a man." Mr Odinga's political moves, key among them being his March 9 unity deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta, often leave the public surprised.   Aisha, Dori and seven MCAs are accused by ODM of disloyalty, disrespect and general indiscipline
