Baringo Senator and Kanu chairman Gideon Moi has urged Kenyans to embrace the historic handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga in 2019 and put the country on a permanent unity path. Mr Moi described the handshake as one of the biggest unity lessons that will be remembered by many generations to come. In his New Year message, Mr Moi said as the year comes to an end, Kenyans should deeply reflect on the handshake deal. “As 2018 comes to an end, it is a moment to reflect the things that shaped us as a country and one of them is the historic handshake between President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga,” said Mr Moi. The Baringo senator — who is fighting a supremacy battle with Deputy President William Ruto ahead of the 2022 elections — said the March 9 handshake changed the political landscape of the country. “The two leaders have taught us that as citizens of this great nation, selflessness triumphs over selfishness and personal ambitions is critical,” said Mr Moi. He said Kenyans should forge national unity in 2019. “We should as a country guard against things that divide us as a country, impoverish our people and stagnate the growth of our nation.” He called on leaders to seize the good will and support by Kenyans and ensure the country feels the impact of the full realisation of fruits of the handshake. He said the handshake should intensify the war against corruption by ensuring those tasked with public resources maintain fiscal discipline, stop wastage and pilferage of public funds. “We should not forget the challenges the Kenyan farmer faced this year by putting in place policies that will make them enjoy the sweat of their hard labour in the farms,” said Mr Moi.   The senator has visited the region Kenya twice in a week.
