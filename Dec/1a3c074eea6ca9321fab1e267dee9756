The deferred National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) 2016/2017 audited accounts report will be presented to the members once again on Thursday during the Annual General Meeting at Panari Hotel. Speaking after a closed door Nock executive committee meeting held at Nock offices in Nairobi, acting secretary general Francis Mutuku indicated that the forensic report will be presented by PKF International. Nock’s General Assembly held in September this year failed to approve the accounts but Mutuku indicated that he hopes the members will accept the report in addition to approving the budget. The AGM will kick off 10am and the organisation’s leadership will brief the media on its outcome and recommendations if any. Mutuku said they will also report to the General Assembly on the intended structural changes at its secretariat with the creation of four positions "to professionalise operations and provide improved services to affiliates and stakeholders." These positions will be in finance, administration, projects and communications. He explained that the transformation will create a full time management team that will run the organisation’s operations in line with the international standards. “The executive committee has the powers to effect these changes and I’m confident we can fund the new structure. The cost of having wrong people at these positions runs into millions and we shall save a lot with the right professionals in place,” he added.
