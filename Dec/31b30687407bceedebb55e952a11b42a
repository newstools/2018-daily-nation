A man and his wife were among four people sentenced to seven years in prison for subjecting their daughter to female genital mutilation (FGM) in Runyenjes, Embu County. Mr Teresio Sammy Nyaga, his wife Ms Irene Gacheri Kinyua, the girl's grandmother Nizareta Rwamba and circumciser Mercy Wanjiku Munyi were convicted on Tuesday. OVERPOWERED The 15-year-old girl told the court that her parents tricked her into undergoing circumcision on December 2 at Kigaa village in Embu East Sub-county. She said she could not resist as she was overpowered. She eventually escaped and reported the incident, that took place at about 5am, at Runyenjes Police Station. Maendeleo ya Wanawake officials and members of the public detained the accused before police arrived. The girl was placed in the care of a relative who lives in Manyatta while nominated member of parliament Cecily Mbarire will pay for her education. She is a Form Two student. DETERRENT While issuing the ruling, Runyenjes Senior Resident Magistrate Beatrice Kimemia said the prosecution proved its case and that the punishment will serve as a deterrent. The parents and Ms Rwamba faced a second charge of helping Ms Wanjuki perform the act. Ms Rwamba was jailed another three years for permitting the use of her home.   Lokwalap Chemelsau, 70, vows to never go back to the vice.
