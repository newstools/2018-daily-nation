The deputy governor position is the missing link in efforts to further democratise and enhance governance. This becomes more evident in case a vacancy occurs during the term. Nairobi City County, for instance, has been without a deputy governor since Mr Polycarp Igathe quit nearly a year ago after he fell out with Governor Mike Sonko. The vacancy also took a long time to fill in Nyeri after then-deputy governor Mutahi Kahiga took the helms following the death of Dr Wahome Gakuru. Governor Sonko appears not in a hurry to pick that principal assistant, and not without a hint of mischief as he, at some point, even proposed his fierce critic, lawyer Miguna Miguna, for the job. As has been pointed out by observers, there is a lacuna that can be exploited to deny the electorate the vital role that a deputy, as the running mate of the governor, is expected to play. It makes a mockery of the system to keep such an office vacant at the whim of an individual. It is unfair, undemocratic and a blatant abuse of the system. Filling the vacancy should not be left to one person, who might dilly dally if it doesnâ€™t suit their interests. It is against this backdrop that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) proposal that it be granted the right to vet deputy governors who take up the position in the middle of an election term makes plenty of sense. We fully agree with chairman, Mr Wafula Chebukati, that the nominee should be subjected to the same scrutiny as the election running mate. Of course, the governor would still pick a candidate but the IEBC would ensure that the nominee fits the bill. This will ensure that the office is occupied by a person who can ably discharge the duties for the public good.
