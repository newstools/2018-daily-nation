Kenya's Mary Keitany has won the 2018 New York Road Runners Pro Performer of the Year Award. Keitany ran a brilliant race winning her fourth New York Marathon title clocking 2:22:48 last month, the second fastest time in women’s marathon in US. Keitany lost last year’s race by 61 seconds, coming in second place after three straight marathon victories in 2014, 2015 and 2016. She received 46.3 percent of the public vote, while U.S. wheelchair racers Daniel Romanchuk and Susannah Scaroni came in second and third, respectively, with 16.2 and 14.1 percent of the vote. Romanchuk became the first American and youngest athlete ever to win the men's wheelchair division at the TCS New York City Marathon, while Scaroni won the first-ever wheelchair division race at the NYRR New York Mini 10K, breaking the 10K world record in the process. "It's a great honour to win the NYRR Pro Performer of the Year award," Keitany said. "This one means a lot because it is the fans who choose. I was pleased to win the TCS New York City Marathon and the NYRR New York Mini 10K in 2018, and I look forward to continuing my success in NYC in the future." The other finalists for NYRR Pro Performer of the Year included: Buze Diriba (ETH), Rhonex Kipruto (KEN), Jenny Simpson (USA), and Ben True (USA).
