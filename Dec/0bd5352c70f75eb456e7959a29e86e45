Farouk Shikhalo, Collins Injera, Selina Okumu and Martin Kitongo were among the big winners at the 6th edition of the Magharibi Michezo Awards held at Bungoma Tourist Hotel on Saturday. Shikhalo, who turns out for Sportpesa Premier League for Bandari, won the Footballer of the Year award for his performances with the Mombasa-based side who finished second last season. He also earned a call up to the national team, Harambee Stars. Kenyan rugby legend Collins Injera was feted as the region's rugby personality of the decade for his exploits on the global stage with national sevens team, Shujaa. Pioneering female professional footballer Doreen Nabwire received a similar accolade as the football personality of the decade.   The Simiyu siblings, former Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu and former Kenya captain and Kenya Harlequin coach Victor Sudi were feted for their outstanding contribution to sport. Simiyu steered Shujaa to their highest ever points tally last season, collecting 104 points for an eighth place finish on the sevens world series. Simiyu challenged the region’s political leaders to create a conducive environment that will retain top talents. “Why is that the region’s top sports men and women have to go to Nairobi to earn a living? Why can’t they do it from here?” he posed.   The awards were attended by Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati, Water cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa, parlimentarians Wafula Wamunyinyi (Kanduyi), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West) among others.
