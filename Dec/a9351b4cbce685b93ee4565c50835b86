British media company Sky on Wednesday said it would axe its sponsorship of road-racing powerhouse Team Sky after next season, ending a decade-plus partnership that has won the Tour de France six times with three different riders. Team Sky has clocked up eight Grand Tour wins since its formation in 2008, but has endured controversy this year for using special exemptions to administer drugs aimed at enhancing performance. The outfit, which has 322 wins in total, will operate as Team Sky for the 2019 season and could continue under a different name if a new backer is found, the Sky statement said. "The vision for Team Sky began with the ambition to build a clean, winning team around a core of British riders and staff," said team principal Dave Brailsford. "We are proud of the part we have played in Britain's transformation into a cycling nation over the last decade," he added."While Sky will be moving on at the end of next year, the team is open-minded about the future and the potential of working with a new partner, should the right opportunity present itself."
