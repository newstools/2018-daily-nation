Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga has said she would not shift her political base to Kisumu County as advocated by some politicians. The County MP said some politicians in Homa Bay County have been trying to persuade her to go for an elective seat in Kisumu County come the 2022 General Election. Ms Wanga was born in Kisumu but is married in Homa Bay County. Her husband is from the Kochia clan in Rangwe Constituency. “I wonder why some people are telling me to go back to Kisumu County to pursue my political ambitions. The reality is that they have sensed that my political profile has surpassed theirs and that is why they have come up with such a lame excuse. I am not going anywhere,” declared Ms Wanga. DISTRIBUTED FUNDS She spoke at Koduogo market in Homa Bay town on Saturday when she launched the distribution of Sh2.7 million to small scale women traders, a programme dubbed Abedo funds. READ: Mud fight and politics of women’s power Ms Wanga argued that MPs behind such calls were fuelled by malice and jealousy over her achievements in Homa Bay County and fear her rising political star. Ms Wanga has shown interest in contesting for the gubernatorial seat come the 2022 elections. This has placed her in a direct contest with ODM national chairman John Mbadi and Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma, both eyeing the seat, currently held by Governor Cyprian Awiti. DEVELOPMENT Ms Wanga said she is currently focused on development and uplifting the livelihoods of low income families in Homa Bay County. “I will show them dust when the right time comes. I am not boarding to go anywhere,” declared the firebrand politician.
