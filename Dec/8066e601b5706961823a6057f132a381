Hi Brenda, I’m 26 and I’ve been dating my 25-year-old girlfriend for almost two months now. She is a school secretary and I work as a teacher at a neighbouring school. We used to spend most of our evenings together. Unfortunately, things went south and she blocked my numbers, including my Whatsapp. Efforts tp reach her have been futile. She claimed that I only want to use and dump her but I love her so much and I still need her. I want to marry her. Please help me work it out.  I’m going to need a little more information than this. This sounds very strange. Why would she suddenly shut everything down, with no reason, and make up these allegations about you wanting to use her? Unless you have shown evidence of such before, I don't understand where all this is coming from. From this little information, it feels to me like she has found someone else, and is not interested in telling you the truth about it. If a person has decided to go, you can’t do anything about that at the moment. Showing up at her school would be incredibly rude, and so, accept your lot. She has said no. You can't change her mind. You clearly did not know her as well as you thought you did, so maybe this dumping is a wakeup call to a blessing in disguise. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com     I intend to marry her but I fear that this distance may ruin our relationship now and in future.
