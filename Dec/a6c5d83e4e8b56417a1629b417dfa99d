A woman has burned herself and her two children to death inside their house in Otonglo area, Kisumu County. Area chief Simon Orwa on Monday told the Nation that he believed the incident was as a result of a domestic conflict between the woman and her husband, who was away at work in Eldoret. According to a neighbour, the 26-year-old woman Rukia Anyango Wamboga came home with a jerrycan containing petrol which she bought from a nearby fuel station. "She was carrying the petrol but at that time I didn't quite tell what was in the jerrycan. She then called her two children to the house and locked it from the inside," said the neighbour. Shortly after, the neighbour said she saw a bright light and smoke emanating from the house. She raised the alarm but there was little they could do to help and nothing was salvaged from the house. The two children have been identified as Shirleen, 6, and Asman, 2. "She had informed me about the issues they were having and I told her to be strong. I am deeply saddened by this," said the womanâ€™s mother, Mrs Sarah Wamboga as she wailed uncontrollably. Mrs Wamboga travelled to the home from Eldoret when she was informed of the tragic incident.
