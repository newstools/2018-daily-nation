High Court has on Thursday certified as urgent a case seeking ouster of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Justice Wilfrida Okwany directed the petitioner Boniface Nyamu to serve Mr Sonko with the suit papers. Mr Nyamu wants the High Court to declare Mr Sonko unfit to hold public office. The case was filed a day after Mr Sonko allowed public service vehicles back into the city centre in wake of ban that caused more chaos, confusion and congestion, the very thing his policy was intended to end. He also claims that Mr Sonko engaged in acts of gross misconduct, citing the tree-planting drive at Moi Forces Academy where the governor allegedly demeaned the Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko in the presence of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Further, he cites an incident in which goons who harassed former Nairobi Business Community Chairman Timothy Muriuki allegedly admitted that the governor had sent them.   Boniface Nyamu says Sonko has let down Nairobians.
