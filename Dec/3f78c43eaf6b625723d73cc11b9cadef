Asante Kotoko coach Charles Akonnor seems to have done his homework ahead of his team's potentially thrilling face-off against Kariobangi Sharks. The 24-time Ghanaian champions touched down in Nairobi on Wednesday and are set to confront Kenya's FKF SportPesa shield winners in the opening round, first leg clash of the Caf Confederation Cup. This clash is set for the Kasarani stadium on Saturday. Upon arrival, the veteran Akonnor acknowledged Sharks as a quality team and hinted he will be all out to frustrate them. The trainer also elected to distance himself from the online banter shared between the club's supporters which has been going on for the better part of the last week. "We are going to play a Kenyan club that is very confident and tough," explained Akonnnor. "They score almost in every match are a threat but what is important at the moment is how we stop that and frustrate them. Ofcourse, the clash will not be decided in Nairobi because there is another game we will host in Kumasi. We are just here to play one half." Sharks face Kotoko on the back of three consecutive wins against Gor Mahia and Djibouti's Artar7.
