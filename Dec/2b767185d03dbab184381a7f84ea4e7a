An aide of a Cabinet secretary has been charged with defilement of his boss’s daughter in a high-end hotel in Nakuru town. Mr Reuben Kiborek was on Thursday accused of sexually assaulting the 16-year-old girl on Sunday night in a five-star hotel . He denied the charge before Nakuru Resident Magistrate Yvonne Kathambi and was freed on a Sh300,000 bond. Mr Kiborek was presented in court after spending three nights, including Christmas, in police cells at Bondeni Police Station in Nakuru. He arrived in court at 11.30am accompanied by his lawyer and was sneaked into the courtroom through the backdoor, perhaps in a bid to escape hawk-eyed journalists who came to cover the case.   Mr Kiborek was also accompanied by a crowd, said to be his friends, who shielded him from journalists who wanted to take his photos. And immediately the accused was directed to the dock, Ms Kathambi ordered "all journalists and anybody who is not Mr Kiborek relative" out of court. Covering his face with a hoodie, Mr Kiborek faced an alternative charge of performing an indecent act with a minor contrary to the law on December 23. The hundreds of his friends, mostly men who were allowed to enter the courtroom, whisked the accused out of the precincts after he was arraigned. The magistrate directed that the matter be mentioned on January 18, 2019 for setting of a hearing date.   Police are frustrating efforts by journalists to expose the crime.
