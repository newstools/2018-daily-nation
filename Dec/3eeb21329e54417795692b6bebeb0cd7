A husband and wife are dead after an apparent murder-suicide in Shauriyako estate, Homa Bay County. According to officials, Ben Mancha, 43, and his wife Phoebe Kamire, 38, were found dead inside their house on Saturday morning by their neighbour. Police suspect Mr Mancha killed his wife before committing suicide. The couple left behind a six-year-old daughter, who was at a neighbour’s house at the time of the murder-suicide. "The daughter slept in a neighbour’s house because the couple was fighting," a neighbour, who spoke to Nation said. Mr Joseph Onyingo, the landlord of the victims, said the couple often had domestic wrangles and frequent fights. Mr Mancha worked at a hardware shop in Homa Bay while Mrs Kamire was a house wife. Police have opened investigation into the incident, Arujo Assistant Chief Jackton Olielo said.
