A chief is among three people killed in renewed ethnic clashes between two communities fighting over water and pastureland in Marsabit County. The Dirib Kombo chief was killed and his body burnt by local residents when he attended the burial of those killed on Sunday in renewed fighting in Giresa, which is on the border of Qilta Korma and Bubisa areas. Speaking to Nation, Saku Deputy County Commissioner Joseph Nyakwara said bodies of the victims in the first attack have been found. "The people had their differences caused by grazing lands and water for their animals when the fight began leaving two dead," said Mr Nyakwara. Mr Nyakwara said a third victim is nursing bullet injuries at Marsabit Referral Hospital. The administrator has urged the locals to embrace dialogue in settling their issues.   One person is nursing gunshot wounds.
