It is very painful to lose two children at a go. These were some of the words that Agnes Njoki, a Mombasa resident, used in her eulogy about her four and six-year-old daughters who were murdered by their father on December 6. HEAVY HEART Mr John Maina Wang'ombe admitted killing Angel Wanja and her younger sister Grace Wangui by stabbing them after inviting them into their house in Mishomoroni to eat mangoes. The 32-year-old, explained, however, that he did not know what he was doing at the time as he was under the influence of alcohol. During the funeral at Sasumwa village in Kuresoi North, Nakuru County, on Wednesday, Ms Njoki said her heart was still heavy. "It is very painful to lose two children at a go because of human error," she said. "Angel, you were indeed an angel to me. I will never forget how fun you were. You always filled my heart with joy." FATHER'S STATE Hundreds of mourners thronged the home of Mr Elijah Wang'ombe Kimani, the grandfather of the two children, to bid them farewell. Mr Wang'ombe said the family was shocked by the news of the girls' deaths. "Even though my son was an alcoholic, I never expected him to commit such an offence," he said. He added that when he visited Mr Maina in cell on Tuesday, he found that he had not come to terms with what he did. Mr Wang'ombe pointed out that he had not witnesses any wrangles in his son's family so he believed they lived peacefully and happily. "I call on the government to fight alcoholism and drug abuse which have ruined the youth," he said. INTELLIGENT Sunday School teacher Mr Stanley Righa said the sisters were termed "university material" as they were intelligent. They were loved by their neighbours, she added. "Angel was to join Standard One next year. She was very humble," she said. The couple has another child, nine-year old Britney Njoki.   John Maina's wife had complained about his drinking for years, neighbour says.
