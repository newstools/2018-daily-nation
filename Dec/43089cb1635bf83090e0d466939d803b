Three hundred girls, who refused to undergo female genital mutilation in Tharaka-Nithi County, graduated from an alternative rite of passage programme after a week training. Speaking during the ceremony that was held at Kajuki Primary School in Igambang’ombe, Tharaka-Nithi Woman Representative Beatrice Nyaga urged the community to shun female circumcision. She said the ‘cut’ has ruined lives of very many girls as most of them drop out of school for early marriages, while others get infections during circumcision. “FGM has no advantage and our community should embrace alternative rites of passage in which young girls are taught the advantages of education, health and many other things that add value to their lives,” said Mrs Nyaga. She said girls should be empowered especially through education and warned that government will not tolerate men who are ruining lives of school-going girls by impregnating them. Tharaka-Nithi County Education, Youth, Culture and Gender executive Abraham Maruta asked students to keep off night events during the ongoing festive season noting that many young people indulge in sexual activities during such events. “My position is no school-going boy or girl should attend any night event including those organised by churches,” said Mr Maruta.
