Gor Mahia midfielder Ernest Wendo says he is 'wary but confident' of his side's next opponents, Cameroon’s New Star Doula, in the Caf Confederation Cup. The no-nonsense midfielder spoke to Nation Sport on Friday evening, moments after the Kenyan champions confirmed yet another tough trip to West Africa in the club's latest bid to qualify for the Caf Confederation Cup group stage. The first round of this two-legged tie will be held at the Kasarani stadium in Nairobi on January 11 or 12, with the return leg slated for Doula a week later. "It will be an interesting and tricky contest for us because West Africans teams tend to come up with cheeky ways of winning football matches. We will have to be wary of them but I am confident," said the 28-year old. This fixture will mark K'Ogalo's second trip to West Africa under a month, following the recent defeat to Nigerian club Lobi Stars in the first round of the Caf Africa Champions League. That loss resulted in Gor Mahia’s relegation to the Confederation Cup for the second year running. The winning team will qualify for the tournament's group stage where a Sh27 million prize money bounty awaits.
