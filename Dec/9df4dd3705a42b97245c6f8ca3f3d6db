Murang'a County residents will benefit from water projects to be initiated by the national government. Water Principal Secretary Joseph Wairagu said Sh180 million has been set aside for sinking of boreholes and construction of water pans. "The sinking of boreholes is spread in almost every village of Murang'a County, and the ministry will be closely monitoring the contractors to ensure they finish their work and the locals get water," he said on Sunday. He said the projects are in line with the county's development strategy of proving potable water to residents. Further, he said the French government gave the government Sh4 billion to increase water production for Kahuti and Gatamathi water and sanitation firms, which serve Kangema, Kiharu and Mathioya constituencies; and that works have already started. CONSERVE He said he will push on with activities seeking to conserve Getare Forest, a water catchment area. "The initiative started by Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James Macharia to assist in restoring Gatare Forest will continueÂ as part of protecting water towers." More measures are being taken to ensure all Kenyans have access to safe water, he said. For instance, funds are being sourced to facilitate the construction of Kahurura dam in Laikipia to harvest water from catchment areas in Mt Kenya. "The government is concerned towards provision of water, which is a key pillar towards realising President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four Agenda that will assist in growing the economy."
