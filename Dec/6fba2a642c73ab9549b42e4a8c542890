Meru Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu has said the county government cannot account for all its vehicles and has called for an audit of the fleet. Speaking during Jamhuri Day celebrations at Kinoru Stadium, Mr Ntuchiu, who is also the Finance executive, directed all drivers to take vehicles to the county headquarters on December 20 for stock taking. Mr Ntuchiu said the county administration is keen on ensuring prudent use of all resources. “We have had challenges in the management of vehicles in the county. We have so many vehicles but we do not know where some of them are. I direct that all vehicles be brought to the county headquarters on Thursday next week without fail,” the deputy governor said. CAR POOLING He said the audit will seek to establish which drivers are entitled to having government vehicles for 24 hours. In July, MCAs had recommended a car pooling plan to maximise the usage of existing vehicles and release most budget for development. “We cannot afford to spend more money on buying vehicles because we do not have sufficient funds. The budget has been directed towards repair and servicing of the existing fleet which should be accessible to all county officers,” Budget Committee chairman Julius Mbijiwe said. Earlier, Mr Ntuchiu had warned drivers against poor handling of vehicles, saying there is need to reduce money spent on repairs. “All departments must ensure the vehicles they are using are well-maintained to release funds for development. We do not want to see new vehicles having dents immediately they are on the road. Drivers must handle them with care,” Mr Ntuchiu said.
