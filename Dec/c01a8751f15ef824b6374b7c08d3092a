The National Transport and Safety Authority has put on notice owners of private cars operating as public service vehicles. The agency's Road Safety director, Ms Njeri Waithaka, said such cars are not licenced. "This is a phenomenon that has been ongoing for a while. But we are working very closely with the police to identify and impound the vehicles; you will notice that the numbers have drastically reduced," Ms Waithaka said on Friday at Kabete Police Station during a crackdown on matatus. She explained that since the private vehicles are not appropriately insured and have no speed limiters, passengers will not be compensated in case of an accident. CAMPAIGN The director added that the crackdown will slide into the New Year, as it attempts to reduce road crashes. "For the first time in four years, numbers begun to go down. Usually in the last quarter of the calendar we always see a sharp rise in fatalities, but not this year," she observed. She said NTSA and the National Police Service will rollout "Operation Elimisha" campaign to sensitise Kenyans about road safety. A mobile application will be developed to bear the information.   The number of Kenyans dying in road accidents has remained constant despite the creation of the NTSA.
