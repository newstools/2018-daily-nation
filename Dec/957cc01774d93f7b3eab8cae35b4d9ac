After playing second fiddle in Wareng and Ol Kalou, World Cross Country silver medallist Alice Aprot is going for nothing short of victory in the third leg of Athletics Kenya Cross Country Series in Kapsokwony, Mount Elgon on Saturday. Aprot, the 2016 Africa Cross Country champion, finished 11th in her season opener in Wareng three weeks ago before losing to World and Commonwealth 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri in Ol Kalou on December 1. Kenya Prisons coach Gedion Chirchir said Aprot is part of the Prisons team set to rock Kapsokwony. Aprot, a native of Mount Elgon, will team up with Catherine Syokau and Nancy Nzisa in the women's 10km. Nzisa had a bad outing in Ol Kalou, finishing ninth. The 2016 Africa 10,000m champion Wilfred Kimitei, who fell badly failing to finish in top 10 in Ol Kalou, will try his luck in men's 10km race. Kimitei will team up with Joash Kiplimo and Boaz Kiprugut in Prisons team. Kiprugut will take part in men’s under-20 race. Favourite Kimitei will face a strong field that includes Team Kenya captain for the 2017 World Cross Country Championships in Kampala Leonard Komon, who will be out to post good results at home. Komon, who hold the world record in 10km road race, won silver medal in junior race at the 2006 World Cross Country and another silver as a senior in 2008. The series heads kicked off in Machakos before proceeding to the chilly terrains in Ol Kalou. Mount Elgon hosts the third leg with Kisii wrapping up this season’s action on January next year. After Kisii, institutional and inter-regional cross country championships will immediately kick off on dates to be announced. These championships are a build up to the National Cross Country Championships slated for February 23 next year at Eldoret Sports Club. Team Kenya will be picked at the Eldoret meet for the World Cross Country Championships that will be held on March 30 in Aarhus, Denmark.
