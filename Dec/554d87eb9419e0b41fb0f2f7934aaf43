Asante Kotoko's management has moaned over the 'small' bus provided for its contingent in Nairobi ahead of this weekend's Caf Confederation Cup clash against Kariobangi Sharks. The 24-times Ghanaian champions landed in Nairobi on Wednesday and will face the FKF SportPesa Shield champions in the opening leg of this first round clash of this continental club championship. On Wednesday night, Kotoko's CEO George Amaoko released a statement claiming that he was not satisfied with the bus and training ground provided for his team by the Kenyan hosts. "We are concentrating on why we came to Kenya, there's no panic here just that the bus they gave us a very small bus. We have requested for a new one but through the liaison officer they have us they say they will not afford," he said. At the same time, Amaoko has complained about the “poor state” of Goan Institute grounds where his team is expected to train ahead of the Saturday afternoon clash.
