Police have arrested a man they describe as an impersonator of an officer of the National Intelligence Service and the master planner of the fake tender to supply laptops to State House. Fredrick Muhanji Mangala alias Douglas Simiyu was apprehended in Kakamega County on Tuesday, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations reported via Twitter on Wednesday. Mr Mangala, who lives in Greenspan estate, will be charged with the offence of obtaining money by false pretences. He was arrested by officers from the Serious Crimes Unit of the DCI, which said his co-accused have already been charged in court. In October, officers from the Serious Crimes Unit sought to crack open a syndicate with links to top government officials that had defrauded suppliers of millions of shillings through dud tenders. Officials at State House, the Department of Defence (DoD) and government ministries appeared to have been colluding with fraudsters. In the case of laptop tenders, several suspects were arrested and some arraigned, with police saying they were in hot pursuit of government officials abetting the crime.   Two people have so far reported to have lost Sh240 million and Sh89 million.
