AFC Leopards are set to complete the signing of two forwards from Tanzania. Speaking to Nation Sport on Wednesday, Leopards organising secretary Timothy Lilumbi confirmed the club had snapped Simba SC reserve striker Marcel Kaheza on loan. The 23-year-old joins the 13-time Kenyan champions where he is expected to beef up their attacking options. Congolese striker Wai Yeka is also in the country ahead of a potential move to the den. The Alliance United striker is set to ink a two-year contract. "These are quality players and our hope is that they settle in quickly," said Lilumbi. "We have a problem with our strike force which seems blunt. From here, I don't believe we will add any players, we are now thinking of reducing the squad." Leopards have only scored once in two outings in the 2018/19 season. Leopards next league match is away to Sofapaka in Machakos this weekend.
