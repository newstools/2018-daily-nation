The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has transferred 3,094 head teachers of primary and secondary schools following retirements. In a statement on Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia said those transferred have until December 28 to hand over. PROMOTIONS The CEO explained that the transfers followed the retirement of headteachers and principals who attained the mandatory age in the last three months. “As a result, deputy heads who are qualified and have exemplary performance records have been promoted to headship positions and transferred accordingly," she said. "Some serving heads have also been transferred to take the positions that fell vacant. This is necessary to match performance and experience with enrollment and institution levels." Mrs Macharia directed the TSC's county directors to ensure a status report on the transitions is submitted to the staffing director by December 31. “Any issues by individual heads that will arise from the transfers will be handled by the receiving county directors, who have been advised accordingly,” said Mrs Macharia. DEBATE Amid a debate on mass teacher transfers in August, President Uhuru Kenyatta slammed the breaks on the delocalisation policy, saying it would be reviewed to ensure families are not broken. President Kenyatta said he had received concerns that some families had been affected by the transfer of school administrators to different counties. Wilson Sossion, the Secretary-General of the Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut), had been calling for the policy's review, accusing the TSC of making decisions without consulting them. At the time, Ms Macharia explained that the delocalisation was meant to enhance national cohesion. In March, the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers disagreed with Knut by backing the transfers, noting contracts allow the posting of teachers to any part of the country.   Education committee says those working in hardship regions are underpaid.
