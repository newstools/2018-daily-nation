An eight-month-old baby from Mombasa County who was reported missing several days ago, has been found, but police say she could have been sold off by her mother. Her mother Ms Joyce Wamboi is among three suspects who have been arrested and detained at the Nyali Police Station on suspicion of abducting her after the police tracked the missing baby to a couple in Molo, Nakuru County. According to Mombasa County OCPD Johnston Ipara, the baby Consolata Wambui was found in Molo after she went missing at Mshomoroni in Mombasa on November 8. ARRESTED “Two people have been arrested. They are Susan Nyambura, 54, and Margret Wairimu, 35,” he said. Ms Wairimu is said to have pretended to be Consolata’s mother and Nyambura her grandmother. Police said they tracked communication between the three on their mobile phones though GPRS. “Any parent who gives false information about a lost child will face the full force of the law,” the police boss said. BABY’S DISAPPEARANCE Mr Peter Kinuthia, Consolata’s father, had told the media that the baby disappeared in the afternoon when she was briefly left alone by her mother. Mr Kinuthia, who has two other children aged 11 and four years, said he had gone to attend the burial of his friend’s mother when he received the news of his daughter’s disappearance. Last week, the family had offered a Sh100,000 reward for anyone who would help them find the baby. The police said the suspects will be charged in court on Monday as they continue searching for one other suspect linked to the incident.
