Mathare United on Saturday maintained their unbeaten start to Sportpesa Premier League with a 2-1 win over Posta Rangers at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru. The Slum Boys grabbed the lead in the 21st minute when Kevin Kimani lashed in a powerful free kick past Levis Opiyo in Rangers goal. Referee Frensina Khamali had awarded the free kick after James Kinyanjui was hauled down by a Rangers defender on the edge of the danger area. A lively Kinyajui nearly doubled Mathare’s lead two minutes later when his powerful grass cutter was cleared off the line with Opiyo well beaten. The Francis Kimanzi-coached Mathare continued dominating possession and territory in the second half and it didn’t take long for Cliff Nyakeya to extend their lead. The lanky striker pounced on a rebound to tap into an empty net after Opiyo had failed to deal with a long range shot. Rangers tactician Sammy Omollo introduced Brian Juma, Gershon Lokonoh and Danson Kago for the ineffective Ken Mutembei, Calvin Odongo and Francis Manoa respectively. The changes had little impact as Mathare continued to dictate proceedings. Dennis Ongeri’s 76th minute strike gave a glimmer of hope for a subdued Rangers but it proved to be too little too late, Mathare carting away maximum points in their last league match of the year. A visibly disappointed Rangers coach Omollo blamed his charges for conceding easy goals. “I’m not happy with the way we easily conceded two goals via set pieces. We must recover in our next match and regain our winning style,” he said. In the opposite corner, Kimanzi revealed that they neautralised their opponents game plan and were able to punish them. “Our opponents pinned their hopes on aerial balls but I am extremely happy we cut them to size and grabbed three vital points which is what mattered most to us,” he told Nation Sport.
