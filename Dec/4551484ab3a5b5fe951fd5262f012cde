A former chief executive of the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) has sued Trade Minister Peter Munya for firing him verbally three months ago. Mr Fanuel Odede Kidenda on Thursday filed his case at the Employment and Labour Relations Court in a bid to get reinstated. EMBARRASSMENT Mr Kidenda asked Justice Justice Hellen Wasiliwa to quash the decision to sack him as it was without notice and "in total violation of labour laws". In the case filed as urgent, he added that the action was taken in the presence of staff. His lawyer Danstan Omari told Justice Wasilwa that he was sacked by Mr Munya during his maiden tour of the EPZ’s premises in Athi River on September 20. Mr Omari noted that his client was appointed by former Trade Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohammed in July for a term of three years. Mr Kidenda was first appointed on September 21, 2015. In a dramatic turn of events, however, Mr Kidenda was sacked after Mr Mohammed was replaced by Mr Munya. The new minister directed the sacked CEO to hand over to Mr George Makateto and ordered him to exit the premises immediately. "FAKE CLAIMS" Mr Omari further told Justice Wasilwa that Mr Munya sacked his client based on "fake and flimsy accusations". He added that the minister arbitrarily used his authority in an oppressive way by kicking out Mr Kidende without notice. “I urge this court to exercise its discretion and quash the decision of Mr Munya then restore Mr Kidenda to his work,” he said. But in his statement of defence, the CS noted that he wields the power and authority to appoint and sack the chief executive officer of the EPZ without referring to anybody. Justice Wasilwa will decide Mr Kidende's fate on December 11. The former CEO has named Mr Munya, the EPZ and the attorney general as the respondents in the case.   Some 13 firms were paid hundreds of millions of shillings for goods that were never supplied.
