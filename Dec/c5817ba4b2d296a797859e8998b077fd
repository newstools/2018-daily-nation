One person is feared dead and scores have been injured after a driver lost control of a bus before it plunged into a flooded section on Waiyaki Way near Kangemi in Nairobi. Rescue teams are currently battling to rescue passengers and crew trapped in the vehicle. The mini bus belonging to Super Metro Sacco crashed at a slippery section of the busy road. The morning accident happened after rains rendered some roads in the city slippery. The bus was heading to town from Kikuyu when the it veered off the road near a flyover and plunged into a ditch full of water.   By the time of going to press, the county rescue team was yet to arrive at the scene and the rescue operation was being conducted by Good Samaritans, mostly matatu crew who ply the route and other road users. The injured were taken to Kenyatta National Hospital.   The delayed response brought into question the preparedness of Governor Mike Sonko's administration and City Hall to handle disasters.
