Medics in Migori have dismissed claims of the emergence of a new Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) nicknamed "Jakadala". Health teams were dispatched to the eight sub-counties in the county to investigate reports of the disease. NO PANIC It was alleged that people died within a week of infection but there was no evidence of deaths. Social media platforms have been ablaze with reports of "Jakadala", some people wrongly posting images of people suffering from other STIs. However, the health teams reported that they did not find any cases at all the public and private health facilities. "The assurance from our surveillance teams is encouraging. We do not have 'Jakadala' in Migori," said county health executive Dr Iscar Oluoch. "The finding should put to rest rumours that had caused panic among residents." The doctor said visitors to Migori should not get scared "because the place is safe" but that "we should not engage in reckless sexual activities especially during the festive season". She said, "We have plenty of condoms in our facilities for safe sex." The doctor noted that the single case of penile cancer at the Migori County Referral Hospital had been referred to Eldoret.   A historic opportunity to eradicate killer diseases is at risk of being missed.
