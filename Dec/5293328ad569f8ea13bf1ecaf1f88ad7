Mathare United has completed the signing of midfielder Kevin Kimani from Sofapaka on a two-year deal. Kimani, who was named the Kenyan Premier League Player of the Year in 2011 while at Mathare, returns to his boyhood club after a five -year sojourn that has taken him to Tusker, AFC Leopards, Al Hazem Sports Club as well as South African outfit Jomo Cosmos. Speaking to Nation Sport after putting pen-to-paper, Kimani said that is glad to be back home. “I think the feeling is mutual, both the club and I are happy to reunite. I have already settled in because I understand the style of play. Having worked with coach (Francis)Kimanzi before it has been very easy to blend in. He knows me very well,” he said. He is expected to form a three-prong attack alongside Cliff Nyakeya and Clifford Alwanga who scored 24 goals between them last season. “I know there will be a lot of responsibilities placed on me so I have to lead by example, I have to be on top always. I want to score many goals and win trophies with this team. Football is all about winning trophies not participating. We have to win something this season,” added Kimani. Francis Kimanzi, the Slum Boys tactician, praised the diminutive attacker who he has worked with before at Mathare United and Tusker. “Kevin brings a lot of value. This is a chance for him to restart his game in an environment that he is familiar with. He comes in at a crucial stage of our project. We are in the third year of our project where it’s all about perfection. We have laid a good foundation in the last two years so this season we are going for more than top four," he said. The Slum Boys have only lost Mike Simiyu and Samuel Ndung’u in this transfer window.
