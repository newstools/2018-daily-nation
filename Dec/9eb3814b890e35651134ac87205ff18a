Cashless payments company JamboPay has moved to court in fight for the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC) revenue collection contract. JamboPay, developed by Web Tribe Limited, is challenging the decision of the NCWSC to terminate the tender process after it was realised that it is in contravention of the law. The tender was terminated in September 2015 after professional opinion advised that the tender allows the successful bidder to deduct commissions prior to remitting the funds to the county contrary to finance laws. But Jambopay challenged the decision before the public procurement and review board which on October 25 directed NCWSC to complete the tendering process within 14 days. Jambopay has moved to court seeking to compel NCWSC to complete the process as per the procurement board’s decision while NCWSC is also challenging to reverse the board’s directive. “The applicant is seeking judicial orders…compelling the respondent to complete the procurement process in respect of tender No. NCWSC/41/2017-implementaion of agency payment integration platform and digital banking channels-mobile banking, mobile money, money wallet, internet banking, agency banking including making of an award within 14 days from the October 25, 2018,” reads one of the orders sought by Jambopay. The company is behind automation of payment of parking, rental, permit and land rates for Nairobi City County. It was also awarded a deal to offer payment services to the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF), which is at the centre of another alleged payments scandal. In both cases, the high commissions paid by the public entities raised the eyebrows of watchdogs.   Police have been directed to secure the offices of a company connected with the multi-billion shilling scam at the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF).
