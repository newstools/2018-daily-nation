The disciplinary committee of the Orange Democratic Movement has recommended the expulsion of legislators Aisha Jumwa (Malindi) and Suleiman Dori (Msambweni) as part of effort to tame 'rebels'. The two have openly declared that they will support Deputy President William Ruto come the 2022 general election. GROSS MISCONDUCT The recommendation was given on Tuesday during a meeting at Park Place Hotel in Nairobi that party leader Raila Odinga attended. In a statement, ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna said the committee's report advised the expulsion of the two alongside six members of the Homa Bay County Assembly and one from Busia. They are accused of gross misconduct. Mr Sifuna said, "Party discipline is paramount. Respect for party leadership, its organs and decisions made are components that make a stronger political party. The Political Parties Act is clear on the running and management of political parties, which includes discipline among party members." Via Twitter, the party said that the National Executive Council asked the nine to respond to the accusations raised against them before action is taken. RUTO DALLIANCE The recommendations were made after Ms Jumwa and Mr Dori appeared before the committee on October 19. They were summoned over their dalliance with the deputy president. The two are among Mr Ruto's point-men in the coastal region. They and other members of parliament have said that their support for him will not dwindle despite the party's threats to punish 'rebels'. Those who have defended the MPs have cited the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Odinga. On the footsteps of Harambee House on March 9, the two shocked the public by announcing that they had quashed their difference and resolved to work together for the sake of national peace, unity and development.   ODM was considering disciplinary action against the MPs.
