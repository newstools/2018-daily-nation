Western Stima forward Henry Onyango is a man on a mission after opening his SportPesa Premier League (SPL) account in Western Stima's 1-0 win over Tusker at the weekend. Onyango, who joined the Kisumu-based side in November from Kibera Black Stars, made his inclusion count scoring the crucial goal with only nine minutes left. It was only his second appearance in the topflight after starring in the second tier last season for Black Stars where he scored 12 goals and provided 10 assists. "I am so happy because it is just the second match of the season and the goal came against a big team (Tusker). It was also my first premier league goal," the 20-year-old told Nation Sport. He is now keen on emulating Kenyan international Jesse Were who rose from Black Stars and made a name at Tusker winning the 2015 SPL Golden Boot. "This season I have set my target at 15 goals so that I help my club finish in the top five category, I have also set my eyes on the top scorer award," said Onyango. Stima coach Paul Ogai spoke glowingly of the speedy youngster. "He is more lethal when he comes in as a substitute than when he starts, but that does not mean he will not start any match, we will give him that opportunity," said Ogai. It remains to be seen whether Onyango will follow in the footsteps of Were and Ronald Reagan who were groomed at Black Stars before establishing themselves in the top tier.   Substitute Henry Onyango scored the only goal of the match.
