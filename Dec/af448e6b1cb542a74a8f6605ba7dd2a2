The Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti wants the court to conduct a public inquest into the death of Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru, who perished in a road crash last year. In a letter addressed to the Nyeri Chief Magistrate, Mr Kinoti said the decision follows a directive from the office of Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji ordering that the matter be disposed as a way of public inquest. But the late governor’s family through their spokesperson Waruru Ndegwa, questioned the prolonged delay by the police to conduct the inquest, adding that they believe the Mr Gakuru was assassinated. “We suspect Wahome was assassinated and it was made to look like an accident. There could be individuals using the system to frustrate the case and the investigations "If anybody participated in the death, that person should held to account. There are some grey areas and we suspect some cover-ups on how the investigation has gone,” said Mr Ndegwa. Mr Gakuru died on November 7, 2018 after a road crash on the Nyeri-Nairobi highway in Makenji. His driver lost control of the vehicle and ripped through a road guardrail. Since then, Mr Ndegwa said officers at the DCI Nairobi office have been frustrating the family by failing to offer updates on the investigations.   County chiefs also arrived in style using choppers and four-wheel drive vehicles
