Despite using borrowed clubs, South Africa-based Daniel Nduva still managed to post an impressive four under par 68 in the second round of this year's Uhuru Shield at the par 72 Royal Nairobi Golf Club on Saturday to grab a four-shot lead. The plus two handicap Nduva, who started with a three over par 75 in the morning round, said his clubs were left in Johannesburg on Friday so he had to borrow clubs from a friend. "It's difficult to use clubs which you are unfamiliar with, but I will keep on trying and see how I finish the event,'' said Nduva half-way the third and final round. He rolled in a number of birdies for his 68 which brought his two rounds total to one under par 143 with the Great Rift Valley Golf Resort's Simon Njogu in second place on 147. Njogu, who had also fired 75 in the morning round, shot level par 72 in the afternoon for 147 leaving home player Kevin Juma two shots behind in third place. Juma, who is carrying the mantle for Royal Nairobi in the absence of defending champion Dennis Saikwa now waiting to join professional golf, shot three over par 75 in the second round for 149. "I made some few bad shots in the afternoon but I will give it a chance in the back nine,'' said Juma half-way the final round. Another Royal player Joshua Ichangi was next on 150 after his back-to-back 75, with Limuru's John Karichu coming fifth with 151. George Felix of Railway and Muthaiga's Zubari Khan were tied at sixth on 152.   Juma, picked up an early birdie at the par five-second.
