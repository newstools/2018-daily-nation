Security committees in Kirinyaga, Murang’a, Kiambu, Nyandarua and Nyeri counties have been instructed to curtail activities of the outlawed Mungiki sect which has reared its ugly head again. The illegal sect has re-emerged, threatening investors and traders through extortion. Central Regional Coordinator Wilson Njenga ordered the police and county commissioners to deal with the violent sect “firmly”, saying the time for warning them at public meetings is over. Speaking at Kabati town, Mr Njenga said the sect has usurped the Muranga County's role by demanding levies from construction sites, businesses and matatu operators. The regional administrator warned the suspects that they have been identified and police are on their trail. “We must protect businesses, both small and large, as well as restore law and order in this region,” Mr Njenga said. The administrator said the Mungiki sect is now concentrated in fast growing small towns and bus termini, where they demand route fees and cash from businesses. “They are back in termini and in the growing areas where they demand money from investors. They are expelling workers from construction sites and demanding their share of wages. We won’t condone these acts and from next month we shall be speaking a different story,” Mr Njenga said. He said the sect has been recruiting young members in guise of mentoring them.   Sect unleashing terror in Kirinyaga, Murang’a, Nyeri and Nyandarua and Kiambu counties
