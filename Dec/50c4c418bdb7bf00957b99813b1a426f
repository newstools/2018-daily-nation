Tension is high in three clash-prone areas of Narok South after one person was killed in renewed clashes between two communities. The victim was caught up in the fresh flare-up of violence that also saw eight people seriously injured with arrows and more than 10 houses torched. According to Narok County Commissioner George Natembeya, the standoff between the two communities erupted on Friday night and is suspected to have been triggered by a cattle theft incident. "The violence was triggered after three men were attacked with arrows in a suspected retaliatory attack after a cattle theft incident. So far about eight people have been injured and hospitalised in Narok County Referral Hospital and other health facilities in Narok," said Mr Natembeya. The administrator said one cow was allegedly stolen at Ololoipang’i area by thieves, sparking outrage in neighbouring villages of Oloruasi and Nkoben. “The fighting started when one cow was stolen at around 10 pm on Friday night. Villagers raised alarm by screaming, heightening tension among locals,” said Mr Natembeya. Mr Natembeya told the Nation that General Service Unit officers and those from the Rapid Deployment Unit have been dispatched to end the violence. In September, the volatile area witnessed week-long ethnic clashes that left at least four people dead, scores injured and over 50 houses torched. The incident also happens barely a day after Mr Natembeya lifted the three-month curfew at Olposimoru area in Narok North.   More than 30 homes were set ablaze at Olmariko and Esoit areas in Narok North.
