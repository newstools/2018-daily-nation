Posta Rangers notched their first win of the season after beating hard fighting Mt Kenya FC, formerly Nakumatt 2-1 in a SportPesa Premier League match at the Afraha Stadium, Nakuru. Striker Ken Mutembei opened the account for the mailmen in the 22nd minute after capitalising on poor defensive play by the Mt Kenya defenders led by Frank Bala. Inspired by the early goal, Rangers continued to dictate play but resolute defending by Mt Kenya coupled by poor finishing frustrated their efforts to get a second goal. Mt Kenya occasional displayed good football, with diminutive Harun Nyakha spraying passes from the middle of the pitch. In the second half, Mt Kenya thought they had equalised after hard-working striker David Chan acrobatically netted after turning in the six yard box, but the goal was ruled out. In the 51st minute, Posta extended their lead after Francis Nambute lost his marker, rose high and headed firmly into the net, beating the diving Mt Kenya goalkeeper Philip Odhiambo. Stung, Mt Kenya fought back but were kept in check by the ever green Charles Odette and the efficient Suleiman Ngotho. Simon Ndung'u, who was anonymous for the large part of the game, pulled one back for the despairing Posta side in the 80th minute. A disappointed Mt Kenya coach Antony Mwangi blamed the match officials for the loss. "We scored a genuine goal which was disallowed, affecting my team's morale," he said. His Posta counterpart, Sammy Omollo expressed satisfaction with the results, saying the team's cohesion was noticeable. "We recruited 12 new players but they are slowly gelling. Today they played well," he said.
