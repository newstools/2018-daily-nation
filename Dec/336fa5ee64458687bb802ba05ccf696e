AFC Leopards rallied from a goal down to hold 10-man Kariobangi Sharks to a 1-1 draw in their opening match of the 2018/19 SportPesa Premier League (SPL) season at Kenyatta stadium on Sunday. Harrison Mwendwa drew first blood at the quarter hour mark before Robinson Kamura equalised from the spot after Sharks defender Geoffrey Shiveka handled inside the box for level pegging at the break. Brian Marita swung in a cross from the right flank on the 11 minutes but Sharks goalkeeper Brian Bwire, who looked troubled to stop it, managed to gather the ball. Michael Bodo was sent off at the stroke of full time for a reckless tackle on substitute Baker Lukooya. On 15 minutes, Vincent Wasambo found Mwendwa with a defence splitting pass, the speedy winger did well to slalom past his markers before finding the far post for the opener. Six minutes later, Leopards, with Serbian assistant coach Marko Vasiljevic on the touchline, drew level through the captain Kamura who converted his penalty into the roof of the net with Bwire beaten. Eugene Mukangula’s rasping shot from outside 18 was handled by Shiveka in a futile attempt to block it and Moses Simiyu called for a penalty. Sharks would’ve restored their lead on 35 minutes but Duke Abuya’s bicycle kick was parried by Jairus Adira in between Leopards’ post. It was an end-to-end action in the second half with both teams pressing for the second goal in vain. More to follow...
