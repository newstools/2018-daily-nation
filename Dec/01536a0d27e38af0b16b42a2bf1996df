Mombasa-based Modern Coast Rangers became the second side to hand a walkover as the National Super League (NSL) entered week two on Saturday. Rangers failed to turn up at the Thika Sub-county stadium to play hosts Thika United, who coincidentally gave the first walkover last weekend to another coastal side Coast Stima. “We had a few issues that let the team delay to arrive in time for the match but I was on the ground waiting for them in vain, since I attended a pre-match meeting, it will be upon the federation to decide because our opponents didn’t have license cards,” Modern Coast Rangers communication officer Ferdinand Ogot said. In Kakamega, Kenya Police recorded their second consecutive win against Green Commandoes at Bukhungu stadium. Clinton Kinanga broke the deadlock on 40 minutes, before Martin Mutua, who scored a goal in Police’s 2-1 win over Fortune Sacco last weekend, doubled the scores on 68 minutes. “I am happy with my boys display today, they went offensive from the word go playing away from home, it’s encouraging result though still too early in the season to celebrate,” Police coach Charles “Korea” Omondi said after the game. At Hope Centre in Kawangware, Kibera Black Stars had Fredrick Oloo to thank in the 1-1 stalemate against Migori Youth as Talanta also posted their second win in a row with a 2-1 result against Bidco United. Former Kenyan Premier League (KPL) outfit Shabana hosts City Stars on Sunday afternoon at Gusii stadium with hopes of going for another three points after opening their NSL return with a 1-0 win away to St Joseph Youth last Saturday. Wazito, who edged City Stars 2-0 in week one, host Kangemi AllStars in the second match at Camp Toyoyo grounds.
