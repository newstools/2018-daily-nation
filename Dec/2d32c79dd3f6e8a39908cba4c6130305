Little-known schools snatched the coveted top positions in the KCSE results released on Friday, even as Nairobi’s Strathmore emerged number one nationally. Kericho’s Moi Tea Girls was number three ahead of such giants as Alliance, Mang’u and Kenya High, while Kisima Mixed in Nyandarua emerged number seven. Homa Bay’s Orero Boys was number nine, beating established schools like Maseno, Maranda and Starehe as Segero Adventist beat traditional star Kapsabet Boys. The compilation of 35 schools based on data collected from across the country shows public schools took 21 positions while private schools had 14 slots. Strathmore School, which had 84 candidates, recorded a performance index of 72.2 points while Moi High School Kabarak came second with 72.1 and had 330 candidates. 16 CANDIDATES Kabarak had 16 candidates in the top 100 best candidates across the country released by the Kenya National Examinations Council on Friday while Strathmore had none. Last year, Strathmore was position 13 while Kabarak was position 11. Moi Tea Girls emerged third best school with a performance index of 69.5 having registered 136 candidates. Sing’ore Girls’ High School from Elgeyo-Marakwet County topped last year’s KCSE with a performance index of 69.9 per cent. However, this time round it did not make it to the best performing 35 schools analysed by the Nation. Knec did not rank schools despite President Uhuru Kenyatta having signed into law the Kenya National Examinations Council (Amendment) Bill in 2016. MOST IMPROVED The council instead released the list of best 100 candidates and most improved candidates across the county. The law made it compulsory for the examiner to rank schools based on their performance in the national primary and secondary examinations. Ranking was scrapped by former Education Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi in 2014. In the 2018 results, traditional giants such as Nairobi School and Lugulu Girls did not make it to the list. Pangani Girls, which produced top candidate Juliet Otieno for the second year running, is ranked position 18 with 295 candidates. In last year’s results, Pangani Girls produced the best candidate nationally, Karimi Naomi Kawira, who scored an A Plain grade of 87.011. Starehe Boys’ Centre, which over the years has been a top performer, is ranked 21 with a performance index of 62.7 and had 256 candidates. TOP BOY Maseno School, which produced the best male candidate, James Kaluna and who was second nationally with a performance index of 87.3, is ranked 24 with a performance index of 62.4 and had 436 candidates. Maranda School with 628 candidates is position 30 with a performance index of 61.
