A mortuary attendant has been sentenced to 52 years in prison for promoting child pornography. Mr Thomas Musabire Kidemi was handed the sentence on Tuesday, after a Nakuru court found him guilty of six counts of sexual offences against two school boys. Senior Resident Magistrate Eunice Kelly said the punishment was for the offences of promoting child prostitution, child pornography sexual activity against the minors. Mr Musabire faced three counts for crimes committed against each boy. The magistrate ordered a five-year jail term for the offence of promoting child prostitution, 15 years for child pornography and six for promotion of sexual offences with minors. The morgue attendant will, however, serve 15 years in jail as the court ordered that the sentences be served concurrently. “The sentences will run concurrently as the offenses were committed from the same transactions,” ruled Ms Kelly Mr Musabire was convicted on November 28 after the prosecution, led by Dennis Atika, proved beyond reasonable doubt that he committed the crimes.   Mr Musabire told the court that he stayed with young boys who had undergone circumcision.
