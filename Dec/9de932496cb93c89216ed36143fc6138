One of Nairobi’s youngest millionaires is fighting to clear his name in a criminal case where he is accused of assaulting a client in his office. Mr John Malogo Ndiritu, the director of aviation company Bush Air Safaris, is accused of causing bodily harm to Mr Moses Kinuthia, who had gone to attend a meeting at his Wilson Airport offices last month. According to a charge sheet, Mr Malogo, who also owns Subru Motors in Lavington, committed the offence on November 16. “On November 16 at Wilson Airport, within Nairobi County, [Ndiritu] unlawfully assaulted Moses Kinuthia thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm,” the charge states. SECOND CHARGE In a second count, the flashy businessman is also accused of assaulting Mr Nickson Bwavi who had accompanied Mr Kinuthia to his office. He is also accused of damaging Mr Kinuthia’s mobile phone during the incident that his lawyer termed as a “small fracas that arose from accounting differences”.   The lawyer also indicated that a video might form part of the evidence. VIDEO CLIP “We understand that there is a video clip and we will deal with that at the trial,” he told Kibera Principal Magistrate Esther Boke on Tuesday after Mr Malogo denied the charges. Mr Kinuthia told police that he had gone to meet Mr Malogo to sort out some invoices he had sent to him for payment. “He became violent and punched me before picking a computer monitor and hit me on the head,” he stated. Mr Malogo, who drove to court in a car without number plates, denied the charges and was released on Sh20,000 cash bail pending the hearing of the case on March 16, 2019.
