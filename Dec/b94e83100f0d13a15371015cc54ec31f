Harambee Stars coach Sebastian Migne is set to earn a staggering Sh30 million bonus if his charges win next year's Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in the country's history. The French coach is basking in the glory after guiding Kenya to the prestigious biannual continental tournament for the first time in 15 years. Stars booked their ticket to next yearâ€™s tournament after FIFA banned Sierra Leone from participating in international football after their government meddled in their football association. Multiple sources within FKF have also informed Nation Sport that Migne will pocket at least half of this amount if captain Victor Wanyama and his colleagues make it to the semi finals of the inaugural 24-nation tournament which will be held between June 15 and July 13 at a yet to be decided venue. A quarter final finish will guarantee the former Republic of Congo coach a Sh5 million windfall. A beaming Mwendwa announced on Thursday that his team had drawn up a players bonus scheme that will be drawn from the Sh50 million promised by Deputy President William Ruto. The DP had also promised the team a state of the art bus that was to be delivered some time last year. Mwendwa also revealed that a three-week training camp in France has also been planned depending on which country Caf picks to host the tournament. South Africa and Morocco are considered favourites to host the event. Kenya might play Jamaica in a high profile friendly match in London in May next year, Mwendwa said. FKF requires at least Sh200 million to adequately prepare the team for the tournament, according to the chairman.
