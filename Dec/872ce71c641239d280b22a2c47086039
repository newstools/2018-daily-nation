The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has on Monday revealed that Court of Appeal judge Otieno Odek will testify against his former partner Tom Ojienda. Mr Ojienda, a senior counsel, is set to be charged with fraud over alleged Sh89 million he received as legal fees from Mumias Sugar Company. The DPP said Justice Odek, who was a partner at the firm of Professor Otieno Odek, Professor Tom Ojienda and Wanyama Advocates, is not under investigation in connection with the affairs of the sugar company as reported by the media. But Mr Haji said the judge “provided a statement to investigators at his own volition.” Mr Ojienda was arrested on Friday evening and taken to Muthaiga Police Station, Nairobi where he spent two nights. Following pressure from the Law Society Kenya, Mr Ojienda was released on Sunday evening pending arraignment.   Senior Counsel Tom Ojienda's release follows intense pressure from the Law Society of Kenya to free him on bond.
