This year’s Africa Club Championships hockey tournaments for men and women start today in Abuja. Kenya will, however, field only women’s teams after the top two men’s sides, Kenya Police and Butali Sugar, withdrew for various reasons. Telkom and the United States International University (Africa) will thus carry Kenya’s flag in the women’s edition. Police won the league title in 2017 with Butali finishing second to earn the rights for the Abuja contest. And while financial constraints locked out the policemen, Butali have opted out to prepare for next year’s tournament after snatching the title from Police this year. That this is the second time men’s teams will not be featuring in the continental club tournament is cause for great concern. While the annual National Police Service recruitment drive reserves slots for talented sportsmen and women, including hockey players, it’s unfortunate that these players are unable to graduate their game by missing out on such tournaments as the continental contest. On the other hand, the serial withdrawals should spur the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) into demanding clubs prove their financial capacity before playing in the national league. These clubs must prove that should they win the league title, then they will be able to finance their participation in the Africa championships therefrom. Failure to meet such financial assurances should mean non-compliant clubs be locked out of the national league. These continental games offer an important platform for Kenyan players to gauge their standards in comparison to those of the rest of Africa. We wish Telkom Kenya and USIU all the best in the contest.
