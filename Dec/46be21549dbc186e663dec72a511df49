Kenya Pipeline coach Japheth Munala has confirmed that he has been approached by Kenya Commercial Bank and might join the Ruaraka-based side in the close season. Munala saw his impressive winning streak with Pipeline halted by Kenya Prisons on Monday as he surrendered the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league title he has won for four consecutive years. His charges lost 3-1 (25-19, 25-22, 22-25, 25-21) to finish third behind KCB, his next employers perhaps. Speaking to Nation Sport after their last match, Munala revealed that talks are at an advanced stage with the Bankers but no deal has been signed. “I am still weighing my options because I don’t want to leave Pipeline at number three. Whoever gives me a better deal will get my services,” he said. Trizah Atuka, Janet Wanja and captain Noel Murambi have also been linked with a move to KCB. Munala refused to blame the rumours for their poor performance in the play-offs where they finished a disappointing third. Instead, Munala has blamed lack of motivation for the team’s dismal performance in the play offs. He however believes that they can still bounce back if they fix their off court issues. “We have to go drawing board look at what we did right in the past four years. We still have a good team which can still do well with the right motivation,” said Munala in mitigation. It remains to be seen where Munala will slot in at KCB who already have David Muthui as head coach and former national team coach Jackton Omukani as his assistant.
