Lawyer Tom Ojienda has been freed from Muthaiga Police Station, Nairobi where he has been held since his arrest on Friday evening. His release on Sunday evening came in wake of Law Society of Kenya’s(LSK) criticism of a trend to arrest suspects on Fridays, a move it says may be aimed at keeping them in police custody over the weekend. LSK President Allen Gichuhi said they will file a petition to challenge Friday arrests and address the issue of freeing suspects on police bonds, especially if they are not flight risks. Mr Gichuhi was among those who called for the release of Mr Ojienda on bond pending arraignment, saying the senior counsel cooperated with police during the search at his office. PLANNED CHARGES Mr Ojienda was arrested over alleged financial misappropriation and fraudulent dealings at Mumias Sugar Company. The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji claimed that Mr Ojienda was paid Sh89 million in fraudulent schemes that involved fake court proceedings orchestrated to get legal fees from the struggling sugar miller. “This inquiry file relates to allegations of use of fake court proceedings, number and parties spread across the country in different courts that were used by several legal service providers to obtain monies, as legal fees, from Mumias Sugar Company,” the DPP said in a statement. Mr Ojienda, who is vying to represent the LSK in the Judicial Service Commission, has denied those accusations claiming his arrest reeks of malice and bad faith.   They are searching for documents needed for the purpose of investigations.
