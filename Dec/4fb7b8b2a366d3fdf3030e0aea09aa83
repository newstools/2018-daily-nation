Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has cast doubts over his former club's chances of challenging for the English Premier League title this season. Ferdinand, during an interactive session with journalists in Nairobi on Friday, also hinted that United have to make changes to return to winning ways. The former England defender is in the country on a two-day working trip courtesy of Guinness. He is set to take part in a series of activities, including an experience to mingle with Kenyan football fans and watch Sunday's EPL match pitting leaders Liverpool against Manchester United. The 40-year-old will also conduct a grassroots football clinic at Ruaraka consisting of aspiring professional footballers from less privileged groups. "The current situation at Manchester United is not good," Ferdinand, who won six league titles with the club, told Nation Sport. "At the moment confidence is low and our league position is not great. Something needs to happen." Commenting on the Kenya men's national football team, Harambee Stars, who recently qualified for next year's Africa Cup of Nations, Ferdinand said: "This is a good opportunity for Kenya. When you qualify for the continental championship for the first time in 15 years, you have to make it count. Grab the opportunity and move to the next level." Under Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho, United are currently ranked sixth with 26 points, a massive 16 behind Liverpool on the 20-team log.
