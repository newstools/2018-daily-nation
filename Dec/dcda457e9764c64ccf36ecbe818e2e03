President Uhuru Kenyatta has taken his second trip on Madaraka Express since launching the service in May 2017. Accompanied by First Lady Margaret, Mr Kenyatta on Sunday boarded the train from the capital Nairobi to Mombasa where he will spend his Christmas holiday. It was a pleasant surprise to passengers as the Head of State walked into the train, said hello and mingled with them for hours.   He walked around and talked to people about the service that was introduced after the Chinese completed the standard gauge railway.   Some Kenyans seized the opportunity to take selfies with the smiling president who had time to chat and entertain children.   "Earlier today, I took the SGR train from Nairobi to Mombasa, during which I met and interacted with fellow commuters who shared their interesting experiences about the service," the president tweeted.   "I am glad that the #SGR train services have enhanced travel for Wananchi between the two cities."   The president’s trip came at a time Kenya Railways is recording brisk business, with Madaraka Express fully booked over the Christmas holiday.   Kenya Railways Corporation on December 2 said tickets for the train for most days up to December 24 were fully booked.   “We are fully booked over weekends and the days to December 25,” said a Kenya Railways spokesperson.   The corporation advised passengers to seek alternative means like road or air. The railway line that was financed by the China's Exim Bank to a tune of Sh324 billion made a Sh9.89 billion loss in its first year of operation. Documents tabled by Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia before the National Assembly's Transport Committee in July revealed that the Chinese-built railway averaged a monthly loss of Sh750.7 million in 2017/18 financial year. The ministry attributed the losses to low cargo volumes for the SGR cargo service. Kenya is expected to started repaying for the heavy loan from the financial year 2019/2020.
