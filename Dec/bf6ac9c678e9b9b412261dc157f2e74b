National Assembly members have been recalled to meet on Tuesday to debate the report on the vetting of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) chief executive Twalib Mbarak. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi in a Gazette notice invited MPs to the special sitting to consider the report of the departmental committee on Justice and Legal Affairs which vetted Mr Twalib on Friday. The MPs are currently on recess. Mr Twalib, who is a former military intelligence officer, was nominated to the position last month. If approved by the National Assembly, Mr Mbarak will replace Mr Halakhe Waqo whose six-year non-renewable tenure at the helm of the EACC is coming to an end. The anti-graft czar nominee is an individual who has largely kept out of the public. Mr Mbarak served in the Kenyan military from 1984 to 1999 where he worked as an infantry officer and later served in the military intelligence unit until his retirement as a major. He later joined the National Intelligence Services where served until 2006. Mr Mbarak later served with the EACC until 2010 when he joined power generating firm Ken Gen, and worked as the security and integrity manager from 2012 until now. He has trained in intelligence in Kenya, Germany, South Africa, the United States and Britain. Mr Mbarak is a graduate of the University of Nairobi where he studied from 2004 to 2009 and holds Masterâ€™s degree in Armed Conflict and Peace Studies from the same institution. Besides, he is also a certified security management professional having trained at the International Security Management Institute of the United Kingdom.   It appears Kenyans will always come up with episodic security measures.
