President Uhuru Kenyatta has started his two-day official tour of Kisumu, the first since the March 9 handshake with his arch-rival-turned-friend Raila Odinga. Mr Kenyatta landed at the Kisumu International Airport aboard a Kenya Air Force plane shortly after 11am and was received by Mr Odinga, his host. Also at the airport was Deputy President William Ruto, Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Cabinet secretaries Rashid Aches and Raphael Tuju, and a host of Nyanza governors. The president's first activity is commissioning the Ahero interchange.   A busy schedule awaits Mr Kenyatta as he is also set to launch a universal healthcare pilot project at Mamboleo, inspect Kakamega-Kisumu roadworks and later attend a luncheon with local leaders.   On Friday, Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga will be in Bondo, Siaya County, where they will be conferred with honorary degrees at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology for their contribution to peace following their March 9 handshake, which calmed post-election tensions.   Mr Odinga is expected to host Mr Kenyatta at his Opoda home in Bondo after the event.   President, opposition chief to reap more fruits of 'handshake'.
