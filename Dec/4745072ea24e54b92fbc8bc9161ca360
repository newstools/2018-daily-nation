A 51-year-old man was on Thursday sentenced to 30 years in prison for repeatedly defiling and impregnating a minor. Mr Ngoloma Kakenyi Mulinge was found guilty of defiling a 12-year-old, Standard Four pupil in 2016. NO MERCY The girl, who is now 15 years old, lives at a rescue center and is under psycho-social support. While reading the judgment, Shanzu Senior Principal Magistrate Diana Mochache said Mr Mulinge deserved no mercy. “You should have been satisfied with your wife or looked for a mature lady,” she said, adding that the case was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The magistrate also pointed out that the victim is younger than the man's first born child, who is 23 years old. “The doctor's report shows that you are the biological father of the child. The degree of confidence is 99.99 percent,” she told the accused. SENTENCE DOUBLED The magistrate further explained that the minor’s life was ruined and that she is fearful that Mr Mulinge will abduct or harm her. “Defilement is punishable by a sentence of not less than 15 years. I hereby double that sentence and hand you 30 years in prison,” Ms Mochache said. In mitigation, the father of four had said that he was his family's sole bread winner. He has two weeks to appeal. "MONSTER" The minor's uncle termed him a monster who deserved the punishment. Muslims for Human Rights filed the case in 2016 after rescuing the girl. Field officer Topister Juma said she used to wash utensils at Mr Mulinge’s home and earned Sh20. “She was defiled several times before getting pregnant. The pregnancy was noticed four months after the incident. We took her to hospital because she could not cope with the situation,” she said.   The incidents reportedly took place between January 2017 and March 2018.
