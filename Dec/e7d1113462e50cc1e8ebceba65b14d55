Bandari maintained their unbeaten run in preseason friendlies with a 2-1 win over Tanzania Premier League side Coastal Union at Mkwakwani Stadium, Tanga on Friday. The result lent credence to Bandari's quest for the 2018/19 SportPesa Premier League (SPL) title after finishing second behind Gor Mahia last season. Once again Bandari captain Felly Mulumba led from the front, scoring from the spot with Bernard Odhiambo adding the second. The hosts got their consolation through Moses Kitandu. Bandari team manager, Wilson Oburu commended his players for their impressive performances in preseason and expressed confidence of doing well in their league matches. “I salute our players for having shown seriousness in their preparation for the league and we hope to start well next Saturday when we face champions Gor Mahia at our home ground,” said Oburu. Head coach Bernard Mwalala said he was eyeing a good start in the first leg. “We want to win our first five matches before we plan for the rest of our fixtures,” said Mwalala. The game started at a fast pace with the Dockers pressing for an early goal. They missed a golden chance to take the lead when Michael Luvutsi’s shot went wide. It was no surprise when Bandari went ahead in the 16th minute through Mulumba's penalty after Yema Mwana was brought down in the box. At the half hour, Coastal Union drew level through Kitandu who picked himself up after being fouled by Bandari custodian Farouk Shikhalo to convert the resultant penalty. Shortly after the restart, Odhiambo handed Bandari the lead after Abdallah Hassan picked him out with a clever pass. Bandari begin their SPL campaign against Gor Mahia on December 8 at Mbaraki Sports Club.   “We will return home immediately after the match,” said Oburu.
