President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) pilot project in Kisumu County on Thursday amid much fanfare. The new initiative is expected to herald the transformation of countryâ€™s health sector that is marred by inequalities because of poverty and lack of medical insurance. Besides Kisumu, Nyeri, Isiolo and Machakos counties will also pilot the first phase of the programme that targets 3.2 million Kenyans with full rollout in all the 47 counties expected by 2022. But just what is universal healthcare? What does it entail and who is eligible? Most importantly, what are the benefits and range of services that one can access services under this programme? Millions of Kenyans cannot afford to pay for health services in public or private clinics because of poverty. A 2014 World Bank report on healthcare in Kenya showed that only 20 per cent of Kenyans have access to medical insurance. ELIGIBILITY All Kenyans are eligible for UHC services. You need to obtain a UHC card which will be issued by National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) in various health facilities. To access UHC services, you are required to produce your UHC card. BENEFITS FUNDING SETBACKS GOOD NEWS OTHER ISSUES PREVIOUS PROGRAMMES An earlier version of this story has been updated to show that Kenyans don't have to first register with the NHIF to access UHC services.   The initiative will complement other existing measures to promote healthcare.
