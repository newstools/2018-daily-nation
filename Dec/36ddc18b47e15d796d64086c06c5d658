Kenya Under-20 coach Stanley Okumbi has named a provisional squad of 36 players ahead of the Council of East and Central Africa Football Association (Cecafa) Under-20 championships to be held in Uganda in January. The team, fondly known as Rising Stars, will assemble on January 2 to embark on their preparations. The team was last in an international assignment in June when they were knocked out of the Africa U20 Cup of Nations qualifiers by Rwanda. The two teams drew 1-1 in Machakos and then played to a barren draw a week later in Kigali. Musa Masika, younger brother to China-based Harambee Stars winger Ayub Timbe, returns to the team with Kenya U17 captain Arnold Onyango also getting a call up. Onyango was snapped up by Mathare United in the December transfer window.
