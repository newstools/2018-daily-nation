For the 17 years that he has played at the top level, Kirwa barely identifies with his official name. Affectionately referred to as Tonje in volleyball circles, Kirwa has carried the nickname in his entire career. It all begun in Form One while at Leseru High School in Uasin Gishu. A young Kirwa used to wear army boots to school during the rainy season. His liking for the army boots became so apparent that his classmates nicknamed him Tonje after then Chief of Defence Forces General Daudi Tonje. “They joked about me being the son of Daudi Tonje because of my first name David. The fact that I also liked wearing the army boots gave them more reason to associate me with General Tonje and that’s how the nickname came to be,” narrated Kirwa with a grin. Even after transferring to Paul Boit in Form Three, the nickname defiantly stuck. After winning the nationals in 2001, Kirwa was called up to the junior national team but he almost missed out on the lifetime chance due to the nickname Tonje. “One of the coaches sent a messenger to my rural home in Cheptiret to deliver the news. So when the messenger got home, he found my mum who insisted that he was directed to the wrong home because there was nobody called Tonje in our family.” “It only took the intervention of my sister who had just come from the river to convince my mum that I was the Tonje the messenger was referring to. I almost missed out on my breakthrough to playing for Kenya,” offered Kirwa. He went on to graduate from the junior team and earned his first senior team call up in 2003 for the Zone Five All Africa Games qualifier against Egypt while still at NSSF. From there, he became a regular at the national team until 2014 with his major achievement being bronze in the 2011 All Africa Games in Maputo.   “Kirwa is a gem."
