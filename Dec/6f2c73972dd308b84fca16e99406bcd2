The Kenya government is struggling to hold onto Harambee Stars coach Sebastien Migne who issued three month quit if his three-month salary will not be cleared. The 46-year-old Frenchman served the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) with a “pay up or I quit” notice that was set to expire today but the ministry has worked round the clock to at least clear his September and October salaries. Nation Sport exclusively broke the story about Migne’s delayed salaries and his quit notice on December 8. The government, through the Ministry of Sports and Heritage, will have to scrounge around their coffers to raise Sh3 million for the remaining month and December. Migne is reportedly on Sh1.5 million monthly salary plus other allowances and benefits. The ministry principal secretary Amb. Kirimi Kaberia has moved to assure fans that there’s no cause for alarm and the coach will not be leaving any time soon, at least for now. “We are very happy with how the coach is doing his work. This month’s salary and last month’s arrears will be processed soon” he said on Tuesday. FKF Media officer Barry Otieno echoed the PS’s sentiment adding that the coach has expressed his disappointment in how the ministry has delayed his salaries from time to time. Migne, who replaced Belgian Paul Put in May, saved Stars’ sinking ship by guiding them two wins and a draw. He ended the country’s 15-year wait to feature at Africa Cup of Nations. Next year’s Afcon will be held at a venue yet to be decided by Caf who have received bids from Egypt and South Africa At the same time, Migne has called on the government to motivate the team more if they want to become a continental football powerhouse. “It will be good for the country to make some effort to motivate the staff and the players to be in good condition,” said the former Congo Brazzaville coach. Migne has notched six wins, three defeats and a draw in 10 games since May.   Frenchman warns federation he’ll walk out on Stars job in one week’s time.
