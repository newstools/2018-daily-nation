Shabana will Sunday host Nairobi City Stars for their second National Super League (NSL) match at Gusii stadium. The Glamour Boys started the season on a winning note, edging St Joseph’s Youth 1-0 in Nakuru last weekend and will hope to maintain their winning ways in front of their fans. Shabana have been granted permission by the Kisii County Government to use the newly refurbished Gusii stadium for training and home matches. Andrew Kanuli's charges are keen on returning to the topflight after an eight-year absence. However finances continue to be a problem despite collecting over Sh6 million recently during a fund raiser in Nairobi. Wazito's quest for an immediate return to the topflight continues on Sunday 4.15pm against Kangemi All Stars at Camp Toyoyo. The taxmen blanked City Stars 2-0 last time out. Administration Police welcome Coast Stima at the same venue from 2pm, while Kibera Black Stars coached by Godfrey Otieno take on visiting Migori Youth at Hope Centre. Thika United, who failed to honour their opening match against Coast Stima in Mombasa last weekend, will entertain Modern Coast Rangers at Thika Stadium. Newly promoted Eldoret Youth travel to Bungoma for their home match against St Joseph’s Youth at Sudi Stadium.
