Four Nairobi County ministers risk being impeached by ward representatives for ignoring committee summons. This comes after MCAs on Wednesday recommended censure and prosecution of the implicated Cabinet members for the failures to honour invitations and summons in line with Sections 18 and 34 of the County Assemblies Powers and Privileges Act, 2017. The county ministers, who have been adversely mentioned by the County Assembly Select Committee on Implementation, have been put on notice over their behaviour. The implicated Cabinet members are Mr Allan Igambi (Finance and Economic Planning), Mr Mohammed Dagane (Roads and Infrastructure), Mr Larry Wambua (Natural Resources) and Mr Charles Kerich (Lands and Health). They are accused of failing to honour invitations to appear before the select committee – whose mandate is to scrutinise resolutions of the County Assembly, including adopted committee reports, petitions and undertakings given by county ministers. Kileleshwa MCA Elias Otieno said the report unanimously passed by the assembly and it is now up to Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to implement it. “It is only in Nairobi where the only person who is known is the governor. He has delegated duties to the department heads yet they ignore the summons. If there is any query at the assembly, it is up to the CEC to come and respond and not the governor,” he said. The committee has also criticised the county administration over its frequent transfer and suspension of managerial officers and sector representatives. In light of the lack of communication between the county administration and the assembly, the committee called for Mr Sonko’s office to establish a liaison office to easier coordination.   Boniface Nyamu says Sonko has let down Nairobians.
