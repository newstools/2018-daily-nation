The government has recruited over 600 police reservists who will complement security officers operating in terror hotspots along the border with Somalia. Speaking to journalists in his office on Thursday, Garissa County Commissioner Joshua Chepchieng' said every location in the affected areas will receive 30 police reservists who will be stationed within the villages. The recruitment follows a request from local leaders who called for reservists to be enlisted from retired locals who have served in the disciplined forces with known good records and who can pursue the militants on foot in areas the security officers cannot access. Mr Chepchieng' said the reservists will work closely with chiefs, elders, wananchi and the security agencies in eliminating the Al-Shabaab menace in the area. PURSUE AL-SHABAAB "With the current recruitments, the reservists will go into interior areas to pursue Al-Shabaab. This, we believe, will work and [we will] eliminate these characters," he said. Ijara, which is part of Boni Forest, one of the hideouts of Al-Shabaab militants, is the worst hit. Other areas that have been targeted by Al-Shabaab attackers are Hulugho, Fafi and Dadaab. "Al-Shabaab menace has forced officers along the border to spend sleepless nights so that we can enjoy the peace we are witnessing today in Garissa and several other parts of the country," he added. The county commissioner urged locals to continue volunteering information to the security agencies and the reservists to enable them effectively deal with Al-Shabaab attacks once and for all.
