All Nyandarua County staff who are on leave have been ordered back to work. Governor Francis Kimemia issued the directive on Tuesday after a day-long meeting with senior county officials as they reviewed departmental performance in the last year. It emerged during the meeting that many projects were not concluded in the last financial year, which must be completed alongside those budgeted for in the 2018/2019 financial year. The most affected include road projects, whose completion was affected by prolonged rains experienced in most parts of the country for the better part of last year and early this year. LONG RAINS In the current financial year, roads have been allocated Sh1.1 billion, which Mr Kimemia said must be used before the long rains begin. “The staff are required to implement, supervise and monitor the implementation of these projects. If they go in leave, who will ensure that the job is done? Service delivery remains a priority for the government,” Mr Kimemia asserted. He said the decision was due to the urgency of the work. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS “Consequently, no staff should be on leave. Those on leave should immediately resume work while no request for leave will be approved. The chief officers should agree with the affected staff on how to take their leave in future,” the governor said. In addition to the national government-funded development programmes, the county has received more than Sh300 million from donors for development projects, with implementation deadlines.   Mr Kimemia made himself scarce after ascending to office on August 21 last year.
