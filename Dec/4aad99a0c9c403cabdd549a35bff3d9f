Hi Brenda, Is it weird to move on quickly after a break-up? I find myself moving on quickly even if I loved a person and my friends say it is not normal.  Hi, I suppose that depends on what you think and what you decide is most helpful to you. Are the people around you concerned because it seems like you were not invested in the relationship? Only you know the answer to that question. In actuality, some people simply do move on quite quickly. It's just the way they're built. Others need time to move on, sometimes even as much a the time the relationship took. Everyone has a different strategy. In terms of speed, though, take care to examine exactly why you move on quickly. Do you close chapters quickly so you deal with the hurt faster, or are you simply moving on because you don't want to be alone? Cultivating a healthy relationship with yourself is important as well. Make sure you're giving yourself time for that too. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I love her so much and I still need her.
