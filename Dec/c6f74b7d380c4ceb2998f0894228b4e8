Police have arrested a man and his daughter in connection to the brutal murder of Nanyuki businessman George Gachibi. Laikipia East Director of Criminal Investigations Jacob Muriithi said the suspects, Charles Macharia, and his daughter Jane Wanjiku, 23, a waitress at a hotel in Nanyuki, will face charges of robbery with violence. They were arrested by DCI detectives at a petrol station in Kirwara, Gatanga Constituency in Murang'a County. The suspects were found with Mr Gachibi's Subaru Legacy car and electronics stolen from him. Mr Gachibi was the proprietor of Checkers Bar and Restaurant in Nanyuki town. LOVE AFFAIR Mr Muriithi said Ms Wanjiru was reported to have been in a love affair with the businessman. The body was found in his bedroom lying in a pool of blood at his rental house on Tuesday by his employees who had gone to check on him after he failed to answer their calls and had not reported at his business. The main door of his house had been broken into by the assailants, who are believed to have murdered him and left it open. STAB WOUNDS Laikipia DCIO Peter Muinde said the businessman had several stab wounds on his body especially on the neck and the upper part of the body. “We traced the deceased's car signal to a place called Kirwara and we also arrested two suspects whom we believe are key in solving the crime," Mr Muinde said. The suspects will be arraigned Thursday morning as detectives said investigations are still ongoing. The man’s body was moved to Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary.
