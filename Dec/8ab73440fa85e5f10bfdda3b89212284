A former Ruaraka OCS Nahashon Mutua has been found guilty of torturing a suspect to death five years ago. Mutua was charged with the murder of Martin Koome, a suspect who had been arrested over domestic brawl. Initially, Mr Kevin Odhiambo was charged with the murder of Koome but was later exonerated following investigations by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority who instead charged Mutua. The initial cover story fabricated by the police was that Koome died after an alleged fight in the cells on the night of December 19, 2013. TRIAL Trial judge Stella Mutuku had placed Mr Mutua on his defence and he called several witnesses trying to exonerate himself. Mr Koome had been arrested over domestic brawl at his home in Baba Dogo, Nairobi but later died after being tortured while in a police cell. Evidence showed that he was assaulted using a metal pipe and his head immersed in a drum of water. He was later taken to Kenyatta National Hospital but died hours later. He had a swollen face, deep cuts, and his wife could barely recognise him, the court heard. In his defence, Mutua admitted ordering Koome to be placed in the cells even he was visibly drunk. Asked why he sent a drunk person in a cell with other suspects, Mr Mutua said Ruaraka station had only one cell. But Mutua denied that he violated the Police Service Standing Orders. The case has been adjourned to December 20 when a probation report and victim impact statement will be filed in court.
