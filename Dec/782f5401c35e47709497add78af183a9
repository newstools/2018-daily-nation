Komotobo Secondary School in Kuria East, Nyabisawa Girls' Secondary in Suna West and Agenda Secondary School in Nyatike missed their results.

While releasing results on Friday, Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed said results for some schools had been withheld over alleged irregularities. The CS, however, did mention the schools or regions affected.  More follows.
