The marking of this this year’s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination will start this week. The Nation has learnt that examiners from all over the country arrived at 19 marking centres on Saturday to prepare for the marking. To ensure integrity of the marking, no examiner is allowed to leave the centres before the marking is complete. “We will reside at the centres till the end. Marking of exams is done under tight security. We do not use phones except during breaks,” a teacher taking part in the marking and who we cannot name told the Nation. Another official said the marking is done in a conveyor belt style. “One deals with one question and passes the script to another. One script can be handled by eight to ten people. I can tell you for sure, from us, a candidate gets what he or she deserves,” the official stated. RESULTS According to Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed, the exam results will be out before Christmas. The CS said marking will be done in good time in order to allow parents to plan. Last year, KCSE exam results were released on December 20. Chief examiners arrived in Nairobi last week to lay the ground for marking of the examinations. The examiners will mark scripts for the 664,585 candidates in 19 examination marking centres in Nairobi and its environs. They will be subjected to proficiency tests by chief examiners and those who fail to score more than 90 percent will not be allowed to mark the scripts. The examiners will also have to go through exam scripts dummies and discuss the way scripts will be marked.   Education CS says no cheating was recorded in the examination which ended Wednesday.
