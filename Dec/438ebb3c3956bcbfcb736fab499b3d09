President Uhuru Kenyatta says that he chose former Vice President Moody Awori to head the oversight board that is set to manage the Sports, Art and Social Development Board because most youths are corrupt. Speaking on Thursday during the graduation of Kenya Commercial Bank's 2Jiajiri initiative, the President insisted he could only entrust the 91-year old ex-politician to handle this fund that receives an estimated Sh2 billion monthly. "You put yourself in my shoes and you see the way people have been stealing money, you have no choice but trust an old man to take care of that money,‚Äù he said. Incidentally, Awori was implicated in the Anglo leasing corruption scandal in a report published by John Githongo in 2006. The Head of State's remarks comes a day after Kenyans questioned the appointment of Awori who last known job was as Kenya's vice president ten years ago. In a Gazette notice dated November 28, Finance CS Henry Rotich announced that this board will also consist of five principal secretaries from the ministries of education, arts, health, national treasury and sports. The 91-year old will work alongside Athletics Kenya boss Jackson Tuwei. "We welcome these appointments and hope they will help us sort our annual budget of Sh1 billion that goes to funding various national teams, leagues and grassroots activities," said Football Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa, yesterday. The board is expected to manage the fund, develop sports infrastructure and facilitate all national teams ahead of international assignments.
