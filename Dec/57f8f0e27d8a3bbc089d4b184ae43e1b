Kariobangi Sharks coach William Muluya has termed the 1-1 draw against AFC Leopards on Sunday at Kenyatta stadium in Machakos a fair result. Ingwe captain Robinson Kamura cancelled Harrison Mwendwa’s opener in the first half with both teams failing to grab a winning goal in the second half. A scuffle ensued towards the end of the match when Sharks defender Michael Bodo roughed up AFC Leopards winger Baker Lukooya in an off-the-ball incident after the Ugandan had fouled Sharks' forward James Mazembe. Bodo was shown a straight red by referee Moses Simiyu. “I think it’s a fair result for us,” said Muluya. “AFC were a bit stronger but we managed to hold on to the last minute." Muluya also rued the absence of his three strikers in Ugandan George Abege, rookie Sydney Lokale and Eric Kapaito who are out with injuries. “When you miss players with 30 goals in between them then it’s a blow but other members are stepping up by playing well as witnessed against Leopards,” he offered. “The best we can handle the injured trio is let them enough time to recover so that they come back fully recovered, if they won’t then we will be forced to go back to the market and shop for new ones,” he stressed. “Psychologically I expect those who’ve not been getting playtime to do better whenever given chances.” The former Mathare United team manager is confident of a better performance from Sharks this season after dropping from third place in their maiden topflight appearance last year to seventh position last season. “I think we should go a notch higher than last season, I am optimistic that our new signings will do better,” he concluded. There’s no time for recovery for Muluya's charges who are preparing for Ghanaian giants Asante Kotoko in the Caf Confederation Cup first round first leg match on Friday at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani.   Robinson Kamura equalised from the spot to secure a point for Ingwe.
