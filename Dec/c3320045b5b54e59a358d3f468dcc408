The hosts will take on an ever improving Zambia who beat Tanzania with a similar score line in another quarter final match in the under-16 pan-African tournament. Kenya needed a second half goal by the Jacob Onyango to beat their western neighbours gave as much as they received from the hosts. Ugandan skipper Thomas Kakaire was a constant thorn in the Kenyan defence well marshalled by Cedric Muchina and Christopher Raila.

After a goalless first half, Kenyan tactician Peter Mayoyo threw in the speedy winger Isaiah Abwal. The substitute’s pace and trickery pinned the Ugandans in their own half before Haron Kibiwott’s lofted cross was turned in by the lanky striker.
