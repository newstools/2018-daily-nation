The family of a teacher who drowned last Sunday at the Mtwapa Creek in the Indian Ocean wants the government to deploy more equipment to help retrieve his body. Mr Mike Mwavita Sanga, a biology teacher at Shimo La Tewa High School had boarded a family boat together with three other fishermen and went on a fishing expedition when their vessel capsized. The incident happened a day after Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed released the 2018 KCSE examination results in which Shimo La Tewa was ranked among the top 15 schools in the Coast region. SWAM TO SAFETY Dr Amos Lewa, a relative, said two fishermen managed to swim to the shore to safety while a body of one of the fishermen was retrieved from the sea. “Sadly, the body of the teacher who happens to be my uncle has not yet been recovered to date despite efforts by police, divers and fishermen to help retrieve it,” he told the Nation. Dr Lewa called on the government to deploy machinery such as helicopters to assist in the rescue operation saying the rough ocean tides caused by underground rivers flowing into the sea are frustrating the operation. Kilifi South OCPD Joseph Kariuki confirmed the incident saying a team has been deployed to assist in the operation. “Two of them managed to swim to safety, one body was retrieved while the other has not yet been found up to date,” he told said. “We have also launched investigation to establish the cause of the accident,” he added.
