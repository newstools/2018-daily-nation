Hassan Oktay has urged Gor Mahia players to complete the job by locking out Nyasa Big Bullets in their Caf Champions League prelimnary round return leg set for Wednesday afternoon at Kamuzu Stadium, Blantyre. Gor Mahia will be out to protect their slim 1-0 victory and will be hoping to knck out the Malawians to set up a first round clash with the winner between Cameroonian side USM de Loum and Nigerian outfit Lobi Stars. Oktay has been hanging around K’Ogalo’s camp and he even gave them team a halftime pep talk during their 1-0 loss to Kariobangi Sharks in their Kenmya Peremier League Super Cup clash on Sunday afternoon. He’s also part of the 25-man strong contingent that has left the country for Malawi. However, club chairman Ambrose Rachier has categorically denied that the Turkish-Cypriot has been appointed as the team’s head coach. Rachier said that Oktay is among four candidates shortlisted for the vacant role at the Kenyan football giant. The other candidates are Stefano Maccopi from Italy, former Asante Kokoto coach Steven Polack (Finland) and a fourth coach who is believed to be of Russian descent. K’Ogalo will do without the services of three regular players namely creative midfielder Francis Kahata, strikers Jacques Tuyisenge and Ephrem Guikan. While Tuyisenge is injured, Guikan was not registered in this competition while Kahata is closing in on a move to Algerian champions CS Constantine hence risk being cup tied should he feature in this championship in the event the move materializes. Burundian Francis Mustafa is likely to lead the frontline as Harun Shakava provides cover at the back wearing the captain’s armband.
