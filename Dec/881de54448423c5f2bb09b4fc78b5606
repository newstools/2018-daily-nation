The appeal case filed at the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) by former Harambee Stars coach Adel Amrouche against Football Kenya Federation (FKF) will be heard on February 6 next year. Amrouche, who led Stars to the 2013 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup, appealed against Fifa’s ruling directing FKF to pay him Sh60 million for terminating his contract in May 2014. The Algerian-born Belgian, who was named Stars coach in February 2013, penned a new five-year deal in January 2014 which would have seen him take home Shs2.5 million per month. Through his lawyer Vitus Derungs, the Belgian lodged a claim with Fifa’s Player Status Committee on March 4, 2016 demanding Sh132 million and an additional Sh5 million compensation for wrongful dismissal. Judge Geoff Thompson on January 25 this year directed FKF to pay the 50-year-old, within 30 days, the Sh60 million plus 5 percent per annum of the said amount as from March 4, 2016 until the date of the end of his deal (January 2019). Both FKF and the Belgian appealed the decision with Amrouche seeking for more. The appeal is listed on CAS website as case number 2018/A/5573 (Football Kenya Federation v Adel Amrouche) and 2018/A/5572 (Adel Amrouche v Football Kenya Federation) among those to be heard next year. CAS is an appellant body of the world football governing body, Fifa.
