Hi Brenda, I'm a 26-year-old man. For close to two months, I was in a relationship with a woman aged 25. We are both working â€“ she works as a secretary in a school, and I work as a teacher in a different school but in the same neighbourhood. In the two months, we spent most of our time together in her house, mainly in the evenings. Unfortunately, things went south recently and she blocked my numbers, including on WhatsApp. She alleges that I just want to use and dump her. My efforts to reach her have been futile as she blocked me. I still need her. I want to marry her. Please advise.  Hi, I am going to need a little more information than this. This sounds very strange. Why would she suddenly shut everything down, with no reason, and make up these allegations about you wanting to use her? Unless you have shown evidence of such before, I don't understand where all this is coming from. From this little information, it feels to me like she has found someone else, and is not interested in telling you the truth about it. If a person has decided to go, you cannot do anything about that at the moment. Showing up at her school would be incredibly rude, and so, accept your lot. She has said no. You can't change her mind. You clearly did not know her as well as you thought you did, so maybe this dumping is a wake-up call to a blessing in disguise. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   Generally I would say 18 is young for a wife.
