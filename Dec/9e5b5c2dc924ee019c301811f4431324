Defending champions Kenya Pipeline began their quest for a fifth consecutive Kenya Volleyball Federation women's National League title with a comfortable 3-0 (25-15, 25-18, 25-17) win over Bungoma County at Kasarani on Saturday. It was expected that the Oilers would stroll to the straight sets victory the moment Japheth Munala named a strong side in his first six. Janet Wanja led the team as setter, with Violet Makuto playing opposite. Christine Siwa and Yvonne Sinaida started as the middle blockers, while Leonida Kasaya and Noel Murambi were the outside hitters. “We were trying new things, this was more of a friendly match for us. The team is coming up very well and we hope that by the time we are playing Prisons on Monday we’ll have gelled. “I was also impressed by Sinaida. This was her first competitive match since coming from injury and she did well. By Monday she’ll be good to go,” said Munala. Bungoma barely offered any resistance in the first set where they went down 25-15. There was a slight improvement in the second set as they fell 25-18 but any hopes of bagging a consolation were dimmed in the third set losing 25-17. In another match played at the same venue, Kenya Prisons also won in straight sets against Kenya Commercial Bank. Unlike Munala, Prisons coach Josp Barasa could afford the luxury of resting Jane Wacu as his charges won 3-0 (25-12, 25-18, 25-20). The introduction of Eglay Kulova, Salome Wanjala complemented the efforts of Doreen Marani and Metrine Nabwire, but Prisons were clearly a class above them with Mercy Moim, Sharon Chepchumba unstoppable in attack. Setter Joy Lusenaka also had a good game combining well with middle blockers Edith Wisa and Lorine Chebet. Emmaculate Chemtai was the best performer for Prisons especially in attack.   The paramilitary side rallied from a set down to win three consecutive sets.
