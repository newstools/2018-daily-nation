It is two out of two for newly promoted Shabana in the National Super League. Oscar Oketch scored the only goal of the match to power them to a 1-0 win over visiting Nairobi City Stars at Gusii Stadium on Sunday. The all-important item was netted in the 57th minute in the well attended match. Oketch headed in a cross from former Kenya international forward Bob Mugalia after some delightful inter-passes into their opponents' territory. Last week, Shabana started their journey to gain promotion to the SportPesa Premier League with a narrow 1-0 victory over St Josephs of Nakuru. Speaking after the match, Shabana coach Gilbert Selebwa attributed their victory to good relation with the club’s management and support from the local community. “We possessed the ball for the better part of the game and deserved a win” he said. However, the former AFC leopards coach and team manager criticised the officiating. “NSL is a very competitive league hence referees should be very keen in decision making otherwise all teams have prepared well for the season,” he said. Selebwa said he would make several changes to the club’s defence after observing their vulnerability against City Stars. His opposite number John Amboko said: “We have lost our second consecutive match but we will rectify our mistakes before the situation deteriorates.” The former Premiership side lost 2-0 to Wazito last weekend. Shabana patron Jared Nivaton confirmed that Selebwa had been hired as head coach. “We have hired Gilbert Selebwa to add experience to the club as we aim promotion to the Kenya premier league next season” he said. Andrew Kanuli, who has been in charge as head coach since 2014, will deputise Selebwa. Shabana will look to stretch their perfect start to three matches when they visit Kangemi AllStars on Friday in Nairobi.
