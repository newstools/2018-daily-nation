The High Court has ordered Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya to pay a four-month salary to the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) chief executive he fired verbally in September. Mr Fanuel Odede Kideda will get his salaries for September, October, November and December. SUCCESSOR Justice Hellen Wasilwa issued the order on Tuesday, when she also directed Mr Munya to withhold the appointment of Mr George Makateto to replace Mr Kideda. The appointment will stand suspended until a labour dispute filed by lawyer Dunstan Omari is determined on February 6. “We have agreed to withhold the appointment of Mr Makaketo until this case is heard and determined,” Mr Omari told the judge before the ruling. The lawyer, in a petition filed under a certificate of urgency, says he wants the decision for Mr Kideda's sacking quashed as labour laws were not followed. CONTRACT Mr Omari notes that the complainant was relieved of his duties during Mr Munya's maiden tour of the Athi River facility on September 20. He also notes that his client was fired yet his contract was renewed in July, for a three-year-term, by the then Trade minister Adan Mohammed. The claimant alleges that there was no notice of his dismissal and that Mr Munya verbally ordered him to hand over to Mr Makateto. QUALIFICATIONS Mr Omari denied allegations by the defendants - Mr Munya , the EPZ and the attorney general that Mr Kideda was not qualified for the job. He says in the petition that the minister arbitrarily used his authority to fire his client. The CS, in his defence, noted that he has the powers to appoint and sack any EPZ CEO without consultation. Mr Munya added that he had informed Mr Kideda of the plan to replace him. Mr Kideda was first appointed on September 21, 2015 on a three-year contract which was renewable.   CS says he wields the power and authority to appoint and sack EPZ bosses.
