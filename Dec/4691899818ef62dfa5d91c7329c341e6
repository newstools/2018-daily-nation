The national football team, Harambee Stars, has finally qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations after 15 years. Football Kenya Federation, the government and other stakeholders should pull in one direction to ensure that the team prepares well for the premier continental showpiece. The team should not go to the football extravaganza just to add to the numbers but to put up a credible show and fly the national flag high. A credible and well-crafted training programme should, therefore, be put in place for the desired results to be realised. Importantly, the welfare of the players and technical bench must be taken care of in terms of allowances, salaries and other remuneration, good training facilities and build-up matches. SPONSOR However, what is happening now is saddening. Head coach Sebastien Migne has threatened to quit if his salary for several months is not paid. This is not the first time Migne has complained, having done so before the team left for Ethiopia, where they drew 0-0 with the hosts on October 10 before winning 3-0 in the return match in Nairobi four days later. It beats logic that the Stars cannot find a sponsor, even as FKF banks on the Sports Fund to finance its activities. Corporate bodies are jostling to sponsor Uganda Cranes, while the French Football Federation announced a Sh95 million profit this year. Like in other countries where football is flourishing, Harambee Stars should be the governmentâ€™s responsibly. It should not appear on the scene only when the team excels in its campaigns. We hope the government will give the team the Sh50 million it had promised the players if they qualified for the Afcon finals.
