The Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) has distanced itself from a petition to Parliament on its behalf by Chuka/Igambang’ombe MP Patrick Munene on teachers’ medical scheme. Kuppet Secretary-General Akelo Misori in a letter to the clerk of the National Assembly dated December 7, 2018 said the union had not engaged the MP to table the petition. “The union has direct procedures of addressing issues or matters with regard to members’ welfare. The same was not followed in this petition. Subsequently, the petition brought before the House did not pass through the secretary-general’s desk,” reads the letter. SATISFIED He said the issues raised have already been canvased between the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), Kuppet and Minet Insurance Brokers and that the union has an ongoing survey on the performance of the scheme, with the initial response indicating that members are satisfied with it. “In that circumstance, the petition should be withdrawn as the union [sorted out] the matter with the employer and the insurance broker Minet,” said Mr Misori. All teachers lost their medical allowances in 2015, which ranged from Sh767 to Sh4,412 per month depending on job groups, with the money going to finance the scheme. Under the scheme, every teacher has a maximum of four beneficiaries who are entitled to an inpatient, outpatient, maternity and dental cover under the comprehensive medical cover. The teachers also enjoy optical and group cover for funeral expense among other services.
