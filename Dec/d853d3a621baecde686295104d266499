Police on Monday arrested a 46-year old man in connection to Sunday’s brutal killing of a chief in Marsabit County. Eastern Regional Commissioner Wycliffe Ogallo said they were holding one Mr Galma Guyo alias Maka Yangu and that they intended to charge him with murder. WARNING Speaking during the burial of Dirib Kombo chief Bida Godana, Mr Ogallo assured residents and chiefs of their security, many having claimed that they had been threatened. He issued a stern warning to leaders, saying nobody will be spared if found to have been involved in the crime believed to have been politically instigated. “The chief is the personal representative of the president. Anybody who takes the life of a chief pokes the president’s eye, so the consequences will be immeasurable,” he said at the ceremony that many residents stayed away from. “Do not be demoralised … you should be more encouraged. The government will not give you latitude to operate through community kingdoms, not in Kenya,” he told the chiefs at Boru Haro village. Mr Ogallo, who read Interior minister Fred Matiang’i’s condolence message, eulogised the slain chief as a peace-loving leader who united warring clans. Mr Godana was hacked to death and his body doused in petrol and then set on fire by people said to be from his community. The chief had earlier attended a meeting organised by the Gabbra and Wayu communities. Residents kept away from the funeral as tensions remained high, his family members also claiming they had been threatened. “He was killed by known criminals in an attack that was planned. It was politically instigated since he was peace-loving,” said his brother Mr Hussein Godana.   Locals kill chief at a funeral and burn his body in clashes over pastureland and water.
