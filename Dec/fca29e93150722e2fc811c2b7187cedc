Police in Narok have arrested a woman accused of burning her two children on the buttocks using a hot machete. The woman is said to have burnt the children, aged 11 and 14 years, at Nairage Enkare trading centre in Narok East Sub-County after they broke a door while fighting over food. The children's father, who was not at home at the time of incident, said he was shocked by the brutality and could not believe it when neighbours told him about the incident. “I tried to call her but she denied that she had committed the heinous act. I had to rush home to confirm,” said the casual labourer. WOMAN ARRESTED When he got home on Tuesday evening, his wife had already been arrested and taken to a police station together with the minors. “The children suffered serious burns and cannot sit down. I feel a lot of pain. It is sad that she did not take the children to hospital immediately,” he said. Ms Elizabeth Kasura, a social worker at the Narok North children's office, condemned the incident and said there was a surge in child abuse cases. She said the children will be taken to Narok County Referral Hospital for treatment before they are taken to a children’s home for custody. CHILD ABUSE Ms Kasura said the suspect will soon be taken to court and charged with child abuse. The minor's father, who has three other children, described his wife as a quiet and calm woman and wondered why she decided to burn her own children. “I have lived with her for over 20 years and I have never seen her even beat the children. All I want now is justice to be served. If she is found guilty or not, I will just accept and move on. I am baffled by her act,” he said.   Another man in Nyeri County came out on Sunday to speak over what he termed as an attack from his wife that left him with severe burns.
