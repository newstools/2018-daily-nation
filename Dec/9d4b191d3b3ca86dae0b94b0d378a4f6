An ambitious plan by the government to ensure all public schools have title deeds has kicked off with the gazettement of a 15-member team that will spearhead the exercise. Cabinet Secretaries Amina Mohamed (Education) and Farida Karoney (Lands) appointed the team to fast-track the processing of title deeds for public schools after it emerged that only 2,070 out of 27,000 institutions have the document. The team consisting of officials from the Education and Lands ministries, and the National Land Commission will be chaired by Dr Sylvester Mulambe — a deputy director at the Education ministry — and is expected to start working immediately. The members are: Alice Nyakiongora (Education), Martin Andati (Lands), Stephen Ondongo Makana (Lands), Gabriel Muthuma Warigi (political analyst), Clarah Chemutai (Lands), Alfred Mwanza (Lands), Weldon Maritim (NLC), Polly Gitimu Wanjiku (Lands), Stephen Gichana Mayaka, Edith Olando and Mary Ngundo (NLC). Ms Caroline Wanjiku Gaita of Shule Yangu, an NGO, Mr Sylvester Osondo and Mr Meshack Odima, both of Lands ministry, will also sit in the committee. The appointments were published in the Kenya Gazette dated November 30. Dr Mulambe said the team will meet next week to plan how to ensure that public schools get title deeds. “We will draw our plan when we meet next week. The task ahead of us is enormous and we are determined to conclude it on time,” he said. The report, entitled Status of School Land for Primary and Secondary Schools in Nairobi County," termed the land titling issue in Nairobi a “big challenge.” “Most schools have not secured title deeds for their land,” the document says.   Prof Kaimenyi said at least 4, 000 schools had so far reported attempted grabbing of their land.
