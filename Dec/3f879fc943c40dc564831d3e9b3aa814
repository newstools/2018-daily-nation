An Administration Police officer who was freed from police custody in Mandera by his colleagues in a dramatic raid on Thursday has been rearrested and flown to Nairobi. According to police reports, 14 officers who raided Mandera Police Station to free the officer have also been summoned to Nairobi for disciplinary action. “Action will be taken in the end. That was uncalled for and cannot go unpunished,” said one senior officer who is privy to the matter. On Thursday night, under the cover of darkness, the 14 officers stormed Mandera Police Station, the county police headquarters in Mandera town and freed Corporal Richard Githaka Karanja. RESCUE MISSION The officers, attached to the Rapid Deployment Unit in Mandera Kapendo Camp, went to the station on foot in full combat gear, stormed in and fired in the air while demanding the release of their colleague. After they rescued their colleague, they fired four rounds in the air and departed towards their Kapedo camp which is about 5kms south west of the station. No other prisoner escaped from the cell during the incident and no casualty was reported. SUSPECTED ROBBERY But a team was later sent to Mandera and rearrested Karanja before flying with him to Nairobi. Another team from the Rapid Deployment Unit was sent on Friday night to replace the 14 colleagues who were involved in the raid. Corporal Karanja is now being held at the Buruburu Police Station awaiting collection by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations from Mandera. Karanja had initially been arrested in connection with a robbery at a petrol station that left a guard dead and at least Sh700, 000 stolen last week.   Drama as 2 police formations almost open fire on each other.
