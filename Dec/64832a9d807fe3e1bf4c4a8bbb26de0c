Technology firm Canon has launched its full frame, mirrorless range of cameras in Kenya targeting professional photographers and filmmakers. Canon says the camera, dubbed EOS R, in Kenya is part of its continued investment in the region. The camera body will sell at a recommended retail price of Sh275,000 while the body together with the lens and kit will cost Sh390,000. “We are very proud to have officially launched our EOS R System today here in Nairobi. This market and the entire East Africa region plays a significant role in our growth plans and we hope that today’s local launch will further cement our position as innovators in imaging technology,” said Amine Djouahra, Senior Sales and Marketing Manager of Canon in Central and North Africa (CCNA). The imaging firm set up CCNA in 2015 to focus on growing its market in Africa and tap into the rising middle class. The company has since been increasing its branding and marketing locally to grow visibility of its products. The EOS R System allows users to shoot and film in extremely low light with accurate focusing. The camera is small and discreet, gives flexibility, plus the advantage of silent shooting. “The silent shutter mode allows for discretion when shooting behind the scenes, it is light weight and can fit comfortably in hand. It also has a bright and clear back screen handy when filming,” said documentary photographer and Canon Ambassador Georgina Goodwin. With the growing blog and vlog culture in Kenya as well as increased demand for online content, demand for light weight, easy-to-use, high-quality cameras has been on the rise. YouTube had 101 million views per month in Kenya as per 2016 data. Locally Canon, Nikon, Panasonic and Sony dominate the professional and semi-professional camera market. The availability of higher quality cameras has seen more users replace their point and shoot cameras with sleeker and more functional devices.
