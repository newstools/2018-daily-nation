Modern Coast Rangers and Thika United risk losing points after theur National Super League (NSL) match set for Thika Stadium aborted on Sunday. Modern Coast Rangers’ team manager Ferdinand Ogot attended the mandatory pre-match meeting with the day’s match officials as the host’s represenatives stayed away. In strange turn of events, 13 players turned up at 3.15pm an hour to kick off but with no Thika United’s licence cards. They then waited for visiting team to show up in vain forcing the centre referee to call off the match. “We had a few issues with our travelling plans that delayed the team's arrival, it will be upon the federation to decide because our opponents didn’t have the player cards and were not in pre-match meeting,” said Rangers team manager. Thika, who were relegated from the top flight last season, gave a walkover to Coast Stima in their opening match for failing to travel to Mombasa. The club’s managing director Mike Muriuki has called on well-wishers to come to their aid lest they pull out of the second tier owing to lack of sponsors. “We don’t have a budget yet and can’t give a tentative date when we shall have it,” he lamented. At Gusii stadium, Gilbert Selebwa-inspired Shabana registered their second consecutive win after they pipped visitingCity Stars 1-0 win courtesy of Oscar Oketch strike. Former Kenya Premier League side Wazito, Talanta and Kenya Police also posted their second wins to take early lead on the 20-team log. Kenya Under-23 international midfielder Teddy Osok’s long range stunner is all Wazito needed to edge Kangemi AllStars 1-0 at Camp Toyoyo grounds. Promoted side Eldoret Youth notched their first victory with a 2-0 win over St Joseph Youth at Kericho Green stadium as Police thumped Green Commandoes 2-0 in Kakamega.
