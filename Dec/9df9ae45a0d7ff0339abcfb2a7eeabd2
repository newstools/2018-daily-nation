A former Administration Police officer was Thursday night killed by an angry mob following a botched robbery at Kegoye in Vihiga County. Wamuluma chief Chunguli confirmed the incident and said the ex-police officer was in a gang of four people who were attempting to break into a house at Vumale village when the owner raised the alarm. The area has been witnessing a series of gang attacks this week with police in the county saying the machete-wielding gang comprises ex-Kodiaga convicts, four of whom have been re-arrested. Three members of the gang that raided the home in Kegoye escaped from the angry mob that was baying for their blood. Mr Chunguli said it was raining at the time of the attack. â€œThe other members of the gang sensed danger when an alarm was raised forcing them to flee. They ran into the nearby forest but angry villagers pursued them and got hold of the former AP. He was beaten to death," said Mr Chunguli, the chief. OTHER INCIDENTS The incident comes two days after another gang terrorised the same area, leaving four people nursing serious injuries on the head. And on the eve on Jamhuri day, a gang broke into a rental house in the same village that is located about 500 metres from the county headquarters in Mbale. Insecurity has been on the rise in the area, including Mbale town and Chavakali which are the most affected. The body of the slain gang member was taken to Vihiga County Referral hospital mortuary in Mbale. The officer identified as Ezekiel Kirui was dismissed from the police service on disciplinary grounds.
