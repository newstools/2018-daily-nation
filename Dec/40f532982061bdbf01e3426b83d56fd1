The fourth edition of the First Lady Half Marathon will be held on March 10, 2019 in Nairobi. The race, which had been shelved for the last two years, was launched on Tuesday morning at State House, Nairobi, by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta accompanied by Rachel Ruto and Ida Odinga. The half marathon is part of the First Lady’s Beyond Zero campaign that seeks to raise funds for maternal healthcare. It was launched in 2014 and has helped to provide fully equipped mobile clinics to all 47 counties. "I am pleased to announce that we have surpassed our target of providing each country with a mobile clinic. Our campaign has provided 52 mobile clinics so far," said the First Lady during the launch. Beyond Zero is a flagship programme by the First Lady that aims to save the lives of mothers and children by preventing unnecessary maternal and child deaths. The campaign also aims to eliminate Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (eMTCT) by 2020 besides scaling up the war against new HIV infections amongst adolescents. Earlier this year, the First Lady launched the second Beyond Zero Strategic Framework (2018-2022), which expands the initiative’s healthcare programmes to include previously neglected health challenges like obstetric fistulae, children living with disability and the increased involvement of men in reproductive health.
