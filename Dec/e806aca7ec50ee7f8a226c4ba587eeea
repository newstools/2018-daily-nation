There is a consensus that the government has done pretty well in recent years in the development of infrastructure. In the towns and even the rural areas, there has been a marked improvement in the road networks. Often talked about with great pride is the fact that some of the marginalised areas have seen their first tarmac road, over 50 years since Independence. Roads open up remote areas and speed up the transportation of passengers and goods to markets, thus boosting economic growth. Good roads literally reduce vast distances by speeding up travel and saving travellers and traders time and resources. A recent report indicating that less than six percent of the countryâ€™s roads are tarmacked will come as a surprise to many Kenyans. According to the Kenya Roads Board, only 4,300 kilometres of the 12,950 kilometres of paved roads are in good condition. However, the national road network has improved with 57 percent now classified as either good or fair, up from a lowly 44 percent in 2009. But the reality is that much more needs to be done. CORRUPTION The national and county governments deserve praise for prioritising the development of infrastructure, but the demand by far outstrips the supply. One major handicap has been the endemic corruption in the award of tenders and lack of strict supervision, which in the end, compromise quality. With their expertise, experience and capacity, the national road agencies must work closely with the roads departments in the various counties to ensure that the desired quality is achieved. The end product must be commensurate with the resources channelled into building this infrastructure. Nothing epitomises national progress more than the development of quality infrastructure, including roads and railways, to ease transportation.
