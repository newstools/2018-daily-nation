Kakamega Homeboyz edged Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) 1-0 in a closely contested SportPesa Premier League match staged at Bukhungu stadium, Kakamega on Saturday. Maxwell Ravel, signed from Ushuru in November, scored the solitary goal for the hosts in the 54th minute. KCB finished with ten men after Shami Kibwana was red carded by referee Davies Omweno in the 78th minute for a dangerous tackle on Moses Mudavadi. Homeboyz coach Paul Nkata was elated for opening the season with a win at home. "We had prepared well for the match. My desire was to win in order to give the players morale for the season. We hope to do the same in our next fixtures," said Nkata. KCB coach Frank Ouna said lack of co-ordination among his forwards contributed to their defeat. “There was completely a break down in the strikers especially in the second half. I will strive to improve on that,” he observed. The bankers dominated majority of the first half and could have found the opener in the 10th minute but Kibwana's shot was comfortably gathered by Gabriel Andika. On the other end, a counter attack from Homeboyz forwards Luke Namanda, Ravel and Mudavadi was foiled by KCB’s tight defence marshalled by Mike Kibwage. Simon Abuko thought he had broken the deadlock on the brink of half time but his goal was disallowed by Omweno for offside. Homeboyz returned the better side in the second half and were duly rewarded when Ravel capitalised on a defensive lapse to open the scoring. Ouna withdrew Abuko, Clinton Kisiavuki and Chrispinus Onyango for Kennedy Owino, Benson Amianda and Bolton Omwega respectively to salvage at least a point but it was all in vain. Homeboyz's Paul Nkata replied by bringing in Kiyoyo Hassan for Namanda as he held on to the slim advantage for maximum points.
