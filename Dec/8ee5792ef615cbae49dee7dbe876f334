Champions Gor Mahia's title defence got underway on a losing note as they went down 2-1 away to Bandari in their opening SportPesa Premier League match at the Mbaraki Stadium, Mombasa on Saturday. William Wardi and David Kingatua gave the dockers a 2-0 lead, before new signing Nicholas Kipkirui pulled a goal back for K'Ogalo. However, it was not enough as Bandari, who finished in second place last season, held on for precious points leaving the champions to lick their wounds in a packed match watched by among others, Kenya Ports Authority managing director Daniel Mamduku. The dockers enjoyed the early exchanges, while Gor Mahia, who were playing a few hours after arriving from Malawi, took control of the last quarter of the game when they literally camped at Bandari's goalmouth in search of an elusive equaliser. William Wadri scored the match opener for Bandari on the stroke of halftime via a firm header from a well weighted Yema Muama cross. David Kingatua made it 2-0 in the 55th minute when he pounced on back pass by Philemon Otieno to goalkeeper Boniface Oluoch to score from close range. Gor substitute and new signing Nicholas Kipkurui, who had just come in for Francis Mustapha, scored the consolation goal for Gor Mahia in the 75th minute from a goalmouth melee. "We dominated the game but missed several clear scoring chances, while Bandari created only three chances two of which they scored," new Gor Mahia Turkish coach Hassan Oktay said after the match Bandari team manager Wilson Ogutu was however happy with the results, saying that they will build on this performance to ensure they achieve their target of wining the league. "We played as a team with players following the coaches instruction to the letter. We just want to build on this going forward," Ogutu said.
