Ambira High School students, who were last month caught on video claiming to have cheated in this year's KCSE exams, have performed dismally. The students were captured hurling insults at Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed and her Interior counterpart Fred Matiang’i. The Nation has obtained the results of seven students, who were reported by the school's principal Thomas Kogola at Ugunja police station on November 21 as having hurled insults to the two CSs. Three scored D plain, two D+ (plus), one C- (minus) and one B- (minus). They were released on December 3 after the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) failed to prefer charges against them. State Prosecutor David Okachi told the court that the DPP received the file of the minors and that he would prefer charges against them when he is ready to do so. Ukwala Resident Magistrate Gladys Adhiambo released the boys and ordered them to co-operate with police, who are still conducting investigations into the matter. Police pursued the minors after a video clip went viral on November 23 showing the students celebrating completion of their national exams. Reacting to the saga, Kenya National Examinations Council chairman George Magoha attributed the behaviour to moral decay in the society. The incident provoked the wrath of President Uhuru Kenyatta, who said they should be punished. On the other hand, Siaya Senator James Orengo said the students were influenced by the rot in the country’s politics, since they see politicians insulting each other. In the video, the students burnt their books and other learning materials as they threw insults at the CSs soon after sitting their last papers.   Ukwala Resident Magistrate Gladys Adhiambo orders the boys to cooperate with police investigations.
