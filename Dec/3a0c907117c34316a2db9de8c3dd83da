Health secretary Sicily Kariuki has appointed two new members to the board of the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). In a special gazette notice issued on Monday and dated November 30, Ms Kariuki announced the appointment of Lattif Shaban and Jacqueline Kitulu to the board. “In exercise of the powers conferred by section 4 (1) of the National Hospital Insurance Fund Act, the Cabinet secretary for Health appoints Lattif Shaban [and] Jacqueline Kitulu to be members of the National Hospital Insurance Fund board, for a period of three years, with effect from November 30, 2018,” said the gazette notice. Ms Kariuki signed the gazette notice two days after NHIF chief executive Geoffrey Mwangi and acting finance director Wilbert Kurgat were sent on compulsory leave amid investigations at the insurer into Sh2 billion loss. The two NHIF bosses were also charged with obstructing corruption investigations when a text message from Mr Mwangi instructed Mr Kurgat not to provide payment vouchers and other documents relating to the payment of millions of shillings to online payment firm Webtribe Ltd. They pleaded not guilty, were released on cash bail and then sent on forced leave on November 28. More than a dozen other NHIF officials will face charges regarding the fraud, including former CEO Simeon ole Kirgotty. At the moment, Mr Nicodemus Odongo who was the director in charge of strategy, planning and marketing has taken over Mr Mwangi’s role at the NHIF while Mr Bernard Njenga, who served as the manager in charge of accounting occupies Mr Kurgat’s position.
