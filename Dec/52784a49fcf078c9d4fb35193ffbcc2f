Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Amina Mohamed has form an eight-member team to audit content of learning materials approved by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD). The team chaired by Mr Mike Eldon, a management consultant, has been given 30 days to submit its report on the learning materials, referred to as Orange Book, following outcry from the public. The task force will look at the books that are for nursery to Class Three pupils ahead of the rollout of the competency-based curriculum. Ms Mohamed’s decision is expected to ensure that the quality of books in the market meet set academic standards following uneasiness by stakeholders over poor quality text books that have found their way in schools. KICD had to come out mid this month to apologise to Kenyans over low quality books in the market and even Jomo Kenyatta Foundation had to recall some of its textbooks because of inappropriate content. The other members of the team are: Dr Walter Juma Ongeti of University of Nairobi, Prof Mohamed Hussein Abdille of Egerton University, Ms Jennifer Kimani, Dr Michelle Wariara Karume — a lecturer and psychotherapist, Ms Alice Nderitu and Ms Soiya Gecaga.   Decision made after where concerns were raised on quality of materials for curriculum.
