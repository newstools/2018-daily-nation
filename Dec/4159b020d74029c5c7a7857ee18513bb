Five church members have died on Monday after the van they were travelling in collided with a lorry near Malili town on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. Athi River OCPD Sharma Wario said the members of St Mary’s Miracle Church, Magongo were heading back to Mombasa after attending a crusade in Siaya. Nine passengers were injured in the 8:30am road crash that involved a lorry ferrying clinker. "From what we have found out at the scene, it looks like the lorry hit the matatu on the side while either trying to overtake or to avoid something," Mr Wario said. "The driver of the lorry is in custody. We shall arraign him once our investigation is complete," he said. Mr Wario said the van was carrying 17 people at the time of the crash, 14 adults and three children. The injured were taken to Machakos Level V Hospital while the bodies were taken to the facility’s mortuary. The OCPD urged motorists to be vigilant during the rainy season.
