Mathare United midfielder Cliff Nyakeya is not concerned about winning the 2018/19 SportPesa Premier League (SPL) Golden Boot despite enjoying a flying start to the new campaign. Nyakeya, the reigning SPL Midfielder of the Year, has been handed his favourite number 10 role this season after playing as a winger for majority of last term. He has thrived in that position scoring two goals in as many league matches and looks set to topple his 2018 tally of 14 which was just two shy of Golden Boot winner Eric Kapaito's return of 16. "I have just picked from where I left last season but I still have a long way to go. It's just two matches and it's looking really good, we had a good preseason and it's now paying off. "I'm not thinking about the Golden Boot but team success. It's my third season here and I want to keep scoring or providing assists to win a trophy with the team. If I get it (Golden Boot), it will be a plus," Nyakeya told Nation Sport. The acquisition of Kevin Kimani has beefed up the Slum Boys' attack having been involved in almost all of the five goals they have scored in the last two matches. That return has left the Pangani-based side top of the log for the second week in a row.   "We had good players in that position last season but he brings a new dimension especially in set pieces. We are now scoring from set pieces because his delivery is good," observed Nyakeya. "If we continue like this and keep many clean sheets then it's going to be an exciting season," he added. Francis Kimanzi's charges opened their campaign with a 2-0 win over Chemelil Sugar before blanking Nzoia Sugar 3-0 at the weekend. The 2008 champions host Ulinzi Stars on Saturday at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani.   The Slum Boys picked their first away win against Nzoia Sugar since 2017.
