Kenyan international winger Harrison Mwendwa came off the bench to provide an assist and a goal as Kariobangi Sharks beat visiting Sony Sugar 2-0 in a SportPesa Premier League (SPL) match at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Tuesday. Mwendwa, who rested Moses Mwangi on 50 minutes, weaved through Sony players before squaring the ball to Henry Juma who smashed home the opener on 55 minutes. The former Mathare United star then doubled his side's lead on 75 minutes with a clever lob over Sony custodian Kevin Omondi after being fed by George Abege. This is Sharks' first win in the 2018/19 season after battling to a one-all draw with AFC Leopards in the league opener a fortnight ago. Sharks travel to Ghana to face Asante Kotoko in the Caf Confederation Cup first round return leg on Saturday in Kumasi. The two teams played out to a barren draw in the first leg last Saturday at Kasarani.   Sharks coach William Muluya made massive changes to his first eleven resting his key players for the crucial trip to Kumasi. Goalkeeper Gad Matthews started ahead of Brian Bwire while Tom Teka partnered John Kuol in defence. Midfielder Sven Yidah returned to the starting lineup after a long injury layoff as Mwangi and Abege led the attack. The Millers, who held Tusker to a 1-1 stalemate in the league opener at Awendo Green stadium, wouldâ€™ve found a consolation on 82 minutes but Maxwell Onyango's effort came off the crossbar before Sharks cleared their lines.
