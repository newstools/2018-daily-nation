The newly opened Sh5 billion house furnishings and furniture outfit, Coloho Mall is banking on online purchases to drive sales. Mall owner Zhong Wu E-Commerce (Kenya) Ltd said the firm is targeting the rising urban middle class keen on latest trends on lighting, wall and floor decorations. “This investment gives Kenyans a one-stop construction materials and an all-house decorations solution for imported and locally made house fittings on one platform,” he said in a statement. The firm, a subsidiary of construction firm China Wu Yi, also plans to cash in on the planned mass housing development projects in Kenya to drive wholesale deals for major private and public projects. Chinese Economic Consular Guo Ce welcomed the investment and urged incoming Chinese-owned companies to sponsor Kenyans to undertake technical training on various trades. Coloho Mall is eyeing the do-it-yourself furniture market and has trained 46 local artisans who will undertake finishing of imported semi-finished furniture.
