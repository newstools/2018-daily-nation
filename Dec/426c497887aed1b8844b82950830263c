More than 300 private security guards belonging to the G4S security firm in Nakuru on Monday downed their tools to protest against alleged poor working conditions and reduction of their salaries. The guards, who provide security services to various institutions, including banks, colleges, universities and offices, disrupted services and camped outside the giant security firm offices at the heart of Nakuru town as they demanded salary hike. They called for the removal of the companiesâ€™ human resource manager, whom they accused of spearheading implementation of the new changes. The Kenya National Private Security Workers Union G4S Secretary General Brian Otieno said the firm management forced the workers to sign letters agreeing to lower salaries. Mr Otieno said the workers were shocked to find their November salaries reduced by at least between Sh4, 000 and Sh6, 000. This, according to the official, was in disregard of court orders issued in April 2018, stopping the review and dismissals. "Our members had refused to sign the letters but found their salaries for the month of November were reduced. This was despite a court order barring them from implementing the new changes," said Mr Otieno. He said that the demonstration by the workers will continue until the changes are reversed. Mr Ernest Mulinya, who has been working at the firm for more than 20 years, lamented that the reduction will negatively affect his retirement benefits. The guard said he was surprised when he went to the bank and realized that his salary was reduced by Sh6, 000. "I did not sign the letters but my salary was equally reduced. I am wondering why they decided to enforce the new changes at the time when I am supposed to retire," said Mr Mulinya. The striking workers are opposed to signing of new contracts, victimisation and lack of overtime allowance.
