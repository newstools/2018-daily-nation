Former Gor Mahia and Tusker midfielder Khalid Aucho has joined I-League side East Bengal. According to media reports in India, the Red and Golds completed the signing of the Ugandan international on Wednesday, and he'll replace Bazzou Armand. “The club has signed Ugandan midfielder Khalid Aucho. He is a midfielder who has experience of playing in European leagues,” said a statement in one of the country's leading websites. Aucho's capture will give coach Khalid Jamil more variety in midfield. "The club are looking to continue their good form and they need to keep going if they want to break the duck this season and finally lift the trophy.” Aucho, formerly at Tusker, has been club-less since quitting Serbian side OFK Beograd in June 2017. Prior to flying to India, he was rumoured to have been training with South African side Orlando Pirates coached by former Uganda Cranes coach Milutin 'Micho' Sredejovic. CUP OF NATIONS Aucho was part of the history-making Uganda Cranes squad that played at the 2017 Cup of Nations in Gabon. He joins compatriots Musa Mudde and Keziron Kizito in the I-League. Mudde and Kizito left AFC Leopards in January for Kerala Blasters and Gokulam respectively. East Bengal are third in the 10-team log with 26 points from 14 games.
