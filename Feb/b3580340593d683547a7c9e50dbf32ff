Journalists were chased away on Friday afternoon as plain clothes security officer prevented activist Okiya Omtatah from serving a court order at the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA). On Thursday, Mr Omtatah received court orders lifting the media blackout of three television stations and several radio stations, which were shut off on Tuesday for airing the live coverage of opposition leader Raila Odinga’s ‘swearing-in’. BARRED But on Friday early morning, a court process server sent by Mr Omtatah was detained at the premises for two hours before he was released and warned against setting foot at the premises. “At around 8am today, two men, who introduced themselves as police officers posted at the Communications Authority of Kenya, abducted my Court Process Server at the headquarters of the authority, and detained him until 10am. Upon release, he contacted me and I decided to come and effect service in person,” Mr Omtatah said in a text message sent to newsrooms earlier.   Mr Omtatah then personally went to CA premises to deliver the order but he was barred from getting in. He vowed he would not leave until he had served the order. CHASED AWAY After a while, the activist resorted to sticking the order on a window of the security station at the entrance of the authority’s offices, and demonstrated to journalists how he would paste the order. Mr Omtatah sent someone to bring him sealing tape, but as soon as he started taping the court order three plain clothes officers chased away journalists. The policemen also threatened to break a journalist’s camera. The men, who wore T-shirts and jeans, had earlier been standing by the gate and mingling with the journalists.   The television stations are still switched off despite the High Court directive.
