The Kenya Films and Classification Board (KFCB) boss on Sunday vowed to continue with the crackdown on vehicles playing videos with pornographic content. CEO Ezekiel Mutua said only licensed vehicles would be allowed to play music and videos with rated content. SANITY “This crackdown is going to continue, we will not relent on this war until there is some level of sanity in our vehicles,” said Mr Mutua. He said travellers were unnecessarily being subjected to mental and emotional agony by being exposed to dirty videos in the vehicles. “We have heard complaints from people, some of whom travel with their children, that they are subjected to dirty and unrated content. This is unacceptable and we will not back down,” said Mr Mutua. He spoke to journalists in Kisii Town. He had been in the county for Kisii University’s Cultural Week, which ended Saturday. ARTS The KFCB is a partial sponsor of the event that has been running for the last five years. Mr Mutua urged students to take arts courses seriously, saying arts-based jobs were among the best-paying globally. He said an investment in arts and drama could help in addressing unemployment in Kenya.
