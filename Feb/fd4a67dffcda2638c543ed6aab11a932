"This is one of the exciting innovative events we are seeing in our sport and our thanks go to British Athletics and the mayor of London for creating it and hosting it," said Sebastian Coe, president of athletics' world governing body the IAAF. "We have eight lanes, eight top nations, eight teams and a host of world-class athletes lining up in each event to win the trophy and prize pot.
