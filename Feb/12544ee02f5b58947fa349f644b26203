PETITION She ordered petitioner Robert Ndemo to pay the respondents a total of Sh2 million. The money will be shared by the first respondent Mr Angwenyi and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). Justice Omondi said the petitioner did not present sufficient evidence to lead to a nullification of the poll. During the ruling on Tuesday, Ms Omondi said some errors of transposition were detected in the results but they were insufficient to result in a nullification of the poll. In his affidavit, Mr Ndemo accused Mr Angwenyi of electoral misconduct and voter bribery. He also cited discrepancies in the vote count.
