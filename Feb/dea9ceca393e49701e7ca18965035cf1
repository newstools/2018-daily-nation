At least three Amani National Congress MPs face disciplinary action as party leader Musalia Mudavadi moves to crack the whip on “dissidents” in his party, after he was openly criticised by his party members for skipping Raila Odinga’s ‘swearing-in’ ceremony at Uhuru Park last month. Among those targeted during the party’s National Executive Council cum parliamentary group meeting early next week over remarks or actions considered subversive to ANC ideals, include Senators George Khaniri (Vihiga) Cleophas Malala (Kakamega) and nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi. 'GAGGING ORDERS' In a memo to all the party branch chairpersons in the country, Mr Mudavadi said that he will not allow any member to fight the party by organising meetings without the approval of the secretariat, a move some members have described as “gagging orders”. “We do not recognise those meetings and the purported resolutions. You are strictly advised to avoid meetings that have not been communicated to you by the party secretariat. “Anyone attending such functions will be dealt with accordingly,” Mr Mudavadi said. The three MPs, who attended the Uhuru Park event, have been critical of their party leader’s failure to attend the ‘oath’ event. Mr Odinga held a mock inauguration as the ‘people’s president’ on January 30 to protest the conduct of the 2017 presidential elections. The event was skipped by other Nasa principals including Kalonzo Musyoka, who was also expected to be ‘sworn-in’ as Mr Odinga’s deputy. Moses Wetang’ula also skipped the event. On Wednesday, Mr Osotsi said that Mr Mudavadi’s continued silence over the “swearing-in” has not helped matters in his party. He also said that the memo lacks the spirit of internal party democracy. “This is an attempt to gag the party members from expressing themselves, which is unconstitutional,” Mr Osotsi said.   Osotsi tells off Muluka for claiming to be the secretary-general of Amani National Congress party.
