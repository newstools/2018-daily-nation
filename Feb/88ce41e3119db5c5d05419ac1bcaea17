AFC Leopards last evening arrived in Kakamega from Nairobi ahead of Sunday's Caf Confederation Cup preliminary round tie against Madagascar's FOSA Juniors. Leopards opponents are expected in the country Thursday morning ahead of the first leg tie of their continental assignment set to be staged at Bukhungu Stadium from 3pm. According to Leopards treasurer Oliver Napali, the Boeney-based side will touch down at JKIA at 7am, and six hours later board a domestic flight to Kakamega. "I cannot tell you where we are staying because we are preparing for war, this is a big match and we have now taken cover to strategise. The next time you will see our players will be on the day of the match," Napali said. On Tuesday evening, Leopards held an open training session at the Camp Toyoyo grounds in Nairobi, where coach Robert Matano took his charges through their paces. "I expect a win," the veteran coach later told Nation Sport. "This is a fixture we have been preparing for since December and I am encouraged by the convincing performances against Al Hilal and KCCA," Matano added in reference to the friendly wins against the Sudan and Ugandan champions respectively. Leopards, who commenced their 2018 league campaign with a one-all draw against Posta Rangers in Nakuru on Saturday, will however have to be wary of their opponents considering recent results. In the past two seasons, Gor Mahia and Tusker have been eliminated from continental assignments by CNAPs (Madagascar) and AS Port Louis from Mauritius respectively.   The club have set coach Dylan Kerr the target of making it to the money spinning group stage of the tournament.
