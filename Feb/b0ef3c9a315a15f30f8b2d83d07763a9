The African Union Commission on Friday criticised Nasa principal Raila Odinga over the January 30 ‘swearing-in’. In a statement posted on its website, Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said he is closely following the situation in Kenya. ELECTION He said that an African Union Election Observer Mission led by former South African President Thabo Mbeki observed the elections, whose results were validated by the Kenyan Supreme Court. “Against this backdrop, and in line with its relevant instruments, notably the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, the African Union rejects all actions that undermine constitutional order and the rule of law. “The Chairperson urges all concerned to desist from any such actions, which also put the political stability of Kenya at risk. He urges all stakeholders to act in strict compliance with the Constitution of Kenya and other relevant texts,” the statement said. President Uhuru Kenyatta won the October 26, 2017 repeat presidential election and his win was upheld by the Supreme Court. But Nasa boycotted repeat election, saying it first wanted electoral reforms to ensure a free and fair election. The coalition has maintained that it won the August 8, election and it presented its own alternative results, which the the electoral body – IEBC – dismissed. RULE OF LAW Mr Mahamat urged Kenyans to obey the law and work for the stability and socio-economic development of the country. He said the African Union will not hesitate “to assist in any way deemed appropriate in defusing the current tension on the basis of the fundamental principle of the respect of constitutional order and the rule of law.” In separate statements on their websites on Thursday, the US Department of State criticised Mr Odinga’s ‘swearing-in’ and emphasised that all leaders should obey the Kenyan Constitution and the rule of law.   They call for respect of the Kenyan Constitution and rule of law.
