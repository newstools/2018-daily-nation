Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has also told off diplomats to stop taking sides in the ongoing impasse between Nasa and Jubilee Party. Mr Mudavadi is the third co-principal to take a stand against the 11 emissaries that gave the opposition an ultimatum to recognise the legitimacy of Uhuru Kenyatta’s presidency before diplomatic talks can be held. VESTED INTERESTS “The diplomatic community this week openly and out of the blues went beyond acceptable call of duty and asked Nasa to unconditionally recognise Uhuru and Jubilee regime before any dialogue can take place. This statement was extremely unfortunate, uncalled for and verging on extortion,” Mr Mudavadi said in a statement Tuesday. He further accused the envoys of being partisan to the Jubilee party and said that they had vested interests in the elections held last year. He claimed that this was the reason behind the favourable outcome of the observations made by the international observers regarding last year’s elections. Both Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka separately condemned the “meddling” of the international communities in Kenyan affairs following the statement from the envoys on Saturday.
