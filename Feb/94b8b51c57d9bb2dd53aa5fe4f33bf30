JOHANNESBURG South African President Jacob Zuma has said ongoing efforts by the ruling ANC party to unseat him are unfair. Mr Zuma added that he has been given no reason by the party why he should resign. "It was very unfair to me that this issue is raised," he said in an unannounced TV interview. "Nobody has ever provided the reasons. Nobody is saying what I have done." With his reputation stained by years-long allegations of graft, Zuma has been told by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party to step down. The South African parliament will hold a vote of no-confidence in Zuma on Thursday if he refuses to go, the ANC says. The struggle has put Zuma at loggerheads with deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, his likely successor, who is the new head of the ANC.   The Gupta family have been accused of driving government corruption under President Jacob Zuma.
