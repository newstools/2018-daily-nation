When well-meaning programmes or projects that could make a huge difference in the lives of the people for whom they were intended do not work as planned, it is disappointing. Yet this would seem to be the case with the medical equipment leasing scheme that was unveiled in President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s first term. The programme was meant to equip public hospitals to ease delivery of medical services. With specialised equipment available in county hospitals, this would not only take services closer to the people, but would also cut their expenses. It is against the backdrop of the World Cancer Day being marked on Sunday that we revisit this matter. The distribution of the leased equipment was meant to enable the treatment of patients in the counties and ease the pressure on the national referral hospitals, especially the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) in Nairobi. RADIOTHERAPY While most of the equipment has been installed, it is a shame it is not working in a number of hospitals, mostly because of lack of experts to operate it. As a result, cancer patients from upcountry, for instance, are forced to travel to the KNH for their radiotherapy several times in a month. But, even here, only three machines are functioning and there are not enough experts, hence the backlog of patients waiting to be put on the machines. One would have expected that before the equipment was leased, a survey should have been done to ensure that all the requirements, including the human resource, would be available. The cost of leasing the equipment is just going down the drain.
