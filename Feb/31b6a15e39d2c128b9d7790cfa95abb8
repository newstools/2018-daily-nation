Nasa co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka has vowed to fight in court a move to repossess part of his vast land in Yatta, Machakos County. Mr Musyoka Tuesday confirmed that part of his land was among the parcels being targeted for repossession by the government. Mr Musyoka said he was among the 66 individuals and entities whose parcels the government has claimed were illegally acquired from the National Youth Service (NYS) and have been listed for repossession. He indicated he will challenge the move in court. “It is serious witch-hunt which we must fight. We are already looking at it,” said the former Vice-President. TARGETED PIECES NYS Director-General Richard Ndubai Tuesday listed the targeted pieces in an advertisement that appeared in the government-owned MyGov pull-out in the Daily Nation. “It has come to the notice of the department (of public service and youth) that a number of individuals acquired specific parcels of land without the knowledge or consent of the department,” said Dr Ndubai. He added: “This is, therefore, to notify the individuals and or entities and the public that the de jure registered owner of the said parcels is the National Youth Service. The department, therefore, does not recognise any claim whatsoever that any individual or entity has over the said parcels of land.” He then gave the affected parties 14 days to voluntarily surrender the land, failing which it will be repossessed at their cost. Mr Musyoka has defended acquisition of the land in previous media interviews. “The 200 acres that make up Yatta farm were bought with a loan from a bank and the issue of impropriety in its acquisition does not arise. However, this has been the only concoction aimed at damaging my otherwise clean reputation” he told the Nation in February 2017. Dr Ndubai’s move follows an order by President Uhuru Kenyatta two weeks ago that all illegally acquired NYS lands be reclaimed to expand training opportunities for youth.
