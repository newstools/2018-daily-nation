LAUSANNE The International Olympic Committee said the 28 Russians who had their life bans lifted by sport's top court CAS on Thursday did not "automatically" allow them to compete at the Pyeongchang Games. "Not to be banned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation" to the 2018 Games in South Korea, the IOC explained in a statement.   The 23rd Winter Olympics will open in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on February 9.
