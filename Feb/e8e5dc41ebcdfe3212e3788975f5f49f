Some 1.6 million candidates have registered for this year’s national examinations, whose deadline is Wednesday. Kenya National Examinations Council acting chief executive officer Mercy Karogo said 964,119 candidates had enrolled for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and 631,750 for Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams. “We urge candidates to register so that they are not locked out of the examinations set for November,” she said, warning that the window would not be extended as they were working under tight deadlines. Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang told the National Assembly’s Education committee last week that Sh4 billion would be used to pay exam fees for candidates in both the public and private schools. Last year, 1.5 million candidates registered for the examinations. At the same time, the Education ministry is seeking Sh428 billion for the next financial year to support its activities. Dr Kipsang told the committee that Sh13.4 billion would cater for free primary education and low cost boarding in the public primary schools.
