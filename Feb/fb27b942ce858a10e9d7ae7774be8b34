In May 1987 at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega, packed to the rafters, was the scene of a famous win by AFC Leopards. Then the undisputed kings of national and regional football, Leopards mauled feared Egyptian giants Al Ahly 2-1 in an absorbing Africa Cup of Champions Cup second round encounter. And even though the brave cats went down 7-2 on aggregate the thousands of fanatical Leopards fans left Bukhungu satisfied their beloved side had kept honour by downing one of Africa’s best team. Deadly striker then JJ Masiga, on Friday updated his Facebook wall with pictures of the match, writing: “May 1987, AFC Leopards SC v Al Ahly SC...... We won the match 2-1 with my name on the score sheet twice,” to nostalgic reactions from dozens of Leopards fans. It may be 30 years later but the current AFC Leopards management want to blast back to the past and are targeting an attendance of over 20,000 fans for Sunday’s Caf Confederation Cup preliminary round first leg match against FOSA Juniors of Madagascar. AFC Leopards Secretary General, Oscar Igaida said security arrangement had been put in place to ensure the safety of all on the day. He said over 10,000 fans would travel from Nairobi for the clash. The official said all club members country wide would cater for their own expenses and also meet the gate charges in order to boost the club’s financial position. “Kakamega town will not be the same. The weekend will be full of all sorts of extravaganza. Leopards are in town and they will be hunting on Sunday.” Leopards set up camp in Kakamega on Wednesday quietly training under coach Robert Matano. “I appreciate the kind gesture the County Government of Kakamega under Wycliffe Oparanya has given the team. It has provided financial assistance up to the last day the team would be living Kakamega to Nairobi,” he revealed.   Harun Shakava has since been named captain.
