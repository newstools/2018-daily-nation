A student leader at Meru University of Science and Technology was on Tuesday afternoon shot dead by police during protests against high school fees and poor learning conditions at the institution. The students from the main campus who were sent home on February 1, following persistent protests over high school fees, barricaded the Meru-Maua road protesting the announcement of reporting dates. Meru University Student Association Secretary-General Evans Njoroge was allegedly chased down by police before he shot dead in a farm during the protest. “Police chased after the student through my compound before one of the officers shot him within my farm,” Dominic Limiri, a witness told the Nation. Photos of a young man lying in a pool of blood, said to be of the student leader, were circulating on social media on Tuesday afternoon. The university Vice Chancellor Japheth Magambo said he was not aware of any death while Tigania West police boss said he could not confirm the death as he was busy at the scene of the demonstrations. Rioting students pelted a Kenya Red Cross vehicle with stones and repulsed journalists. The university administration last week announced that fourth year students were to report back to school Wednesday February 28, while the rest were to report between March 1 and March 6.
