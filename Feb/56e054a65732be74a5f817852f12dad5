Mount Kenya University (MKU) will now offer degree courses following accreditation by the regulator. The Nursing Council of Kenya has accredited the university to offer a Bachelor of Science degree in nursing and the institution will be allowed to admit a maximum of 100 students. The accreditation is valid until 2022. The university now joins five other institutions of higher learning that have attained full accreditation to offer nursing courses at degree level. These are the Aga Khan University, Catholic University of Eastern Africa, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Moi University and Kenya Methodist University (KeMU). Last week, the council put on notice rogue institutions offering substandard nursing courses telling them to upgrade or face closure. NCK CEO, Ms Edna Tallam, assured Kenyans that the council is determined to make sure only qualified institutions offer the critical course. “We are concerned as a council on the increasing half-baked nursing graduates who are incompetent and are handling the lives of millions of Kenyans on a daily basis,” she said.
