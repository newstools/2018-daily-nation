Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria and his rival, Equity Bank chairman Peter Munga, have resolved to work together in the county's water sector. The two have also agreed to withdraw cases filed in different courts against each other and the respective organisations they lead. Mr Wa Iria and Mr Munga agreed to meet on Wednesday at the Governor’s office together with chairmen of the five water companies in the county. WATER PRICESThe chairmen agreed to dissolve the separate water companies and form one firm that will provide services to Murang’a residents. Mr Wa Iria has been accusing Mr Munga of oppressing water consumers by charging exorbitant rates for the commodity. Mr Munga on the other hand has been accusing the governor of hypocrisy, maintaining that he is usually represented in the board. Mr Munga is also the chairperson of Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company. RESTRUCTUREHowever, after a four-hour meeting, both came out and announced that they were ready to bury the hatchet and work together in delivering safe drinking water to 70 per cent of Murang’a residents who do not have access to clean drinking water. But the county boss reiterated his earlier announcement that the management of the five water companies would be restructured to enhance service delivery to locals. “As I said, the restructuring is still in force but the orders will now be implemented by the water companies; restructuring does not mean that people will have to go home. "In fact, we need more people to actualise the dream of connecting more people to water,” Mr Wa Iria said. He said that all the court cases regarding water issues would be withdrawn since he had resolved to work jointly with the chairmen of the water companies.
