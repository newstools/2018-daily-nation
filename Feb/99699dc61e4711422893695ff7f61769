Lawyer Miguna Miguna has filed a suit seeking reinstatement of his Kenyan passport and citizenship. He is also seeking an order to allow him back into the country, as well as access to immigration and customs clearance. Dr Miguna filed his suit through lawyers John Khaminwa and Nelson Havi who swore an affidavit on his behalf. Dr Miguna sued Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i, immigration boss Gordon Kihalangwa, Inspector-General of police Joseph Boinnet and Director of Criminal Investigation George Kinoti. He has also sued officers in charge of the Flying Squad police unit, the one commanding at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and the Attorney General Githu Muigai. "The case relates to illegal and arbitrary revocation of Dr Miguna's citizenship and the confiscation of his passport as well as the declaration that he is a prohibited immigrant," his lawyers said. They allege that his ‘deportation’ to Canada is a total violation of constitutional, municipal and international law on citizenship and right to a fair administrative action and dignity. He therefore wants an order issued suspending the declaration by Mr Matiang'i that he is a prohibited immigrant hence not a Kenyan citizen. He also wants the sued parties ordered to reinstate his passport within five days and that they should also facilitate his re-entry. He further wants the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, which is listed as an interested party in the case be allowed access to the immigration and customs so as to generate a report to be filed in court with regards to his treatment. Dr Miguna was deported to Canada on February 6 after being held incommunicado for five days.  More to follow.
