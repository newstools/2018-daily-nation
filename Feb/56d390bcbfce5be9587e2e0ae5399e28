The rescheduled World Cricket League Division Two match between Kenya and hosts Namibia at United Ground in Windhoek was rained off on Saturday. The two nations were originally scheduled to play on Friday at the same venue but the game was called off before a single ball could be bowled due to a wet outfield following a heavy downpour in the country’s capital city. Saturday’s match was stopped in the second innings after five overs had been bowled when skies opened up. The two teams will now share points 1-1 each. Kenya next face Canada on Sunday at Affies Park. Kenya’s innings was shambolic as batsmen failed to cope with Namibia’s stiff bowling and tight fielding. The tourists lost wickets at a regular interval without meaningful runs showing on the scoreboard. Kenya’s batting was decimated for a paltry 83 runs in 38. 5 overs. Rakep Patel’s 16 runs was the highest scorer for Kenya. Six teams - Kenya, Canada, United Arabs Emirates, Nepal, Oman and Namibia are fighting for the remaining two slots in the 2019 World Cup qualifier set for Zimbabwe from March 4 to 25. Eight teams have already booked their places for Zimbabwe event namely, Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Ireland, Netherlands and Papua New Guinea. Others are Scotland, West Indies and Zimbabwe. The nations that have already qualified for the World Cup are hosts England, Australia, Bangladesh, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka.Kenya started their campaign for a place in Zimbabwe on the wrong footing when they lost to UAE by a massive 218 runs. After day one action Canada stood atop the table standings with two points, same as UAE and Nepal, but with a superior net run rate. Namibia are fourth, followed by Kenya and Oman. The last three teams are pointless.
