The Nation Media Group’s broadcasting division is mulling over the acquisition of Kenyan Premier League football broadcast rights for the 2018 season NTV. NTV’s head of TV production Justus Tharao says talks are at an advanced stage regarding plans of airing at least two matches every weekend. “This is an exciting prospect for NTV as we seek to cater for all our viewers, and the Kenyan Premier League offers us an opportunity to deliver engaging local sports content to our viewers over the weekend,” Tharao said. NTV has already signed a deal with KPL to air the match between Kariobangi Sharks and Vihiga United, which will be played at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos from 4pm on Sunday. “The match is a perfect introduction to our viewers because we believe it will be a competitive and on-the-edge league match," said Tharao. Kariobangi Sharks opened their second stint in the top flight with a 1-0 win over Nzoia Sugar as debutants Vihiga United lost 2-1 to Mathare United on match day one. The 2018 KPL opening match day was aired in various television stations in the country with the league owners using MediaPro, a television production company, shooting the matches for live broadcast. On match day 2, NTV has already signed a deal with KPL to air the match between Kariobangi Sharks and Vihiga United, which will be played at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos from 4pm. "The match is a perfect introduction to our viewers because we believe it will be a competitive and on-the-edge league match."
