After posting poor results last season, Nakuru Amateur Boxing Club has started a steady rise this season, beating Kaloleni Boxing Club 4-2 in the final of Nakuru County Novices boxing championship at ‘Madison Square Garden’ in Nakuru on Saturday night. The once popular club, under the guidance of Hungary-trained coach Muthee ‘Carlos’ Mwangi, however started the contest on a losing note when Kevin Ndung’u of Kaloleni unleashed a flurry of jabs to beat Nakuru’s Kevin Ndun’gu on majority points. Sensing imminent defeat on home ground, Nakuru raised their game in the light flyweight contest, and Nakuru’s fast-rising boxer Vincent Gitahi bombarded Branton Mukanda of Kaloleni with damaging hooks to clinch the contest on majority points. Nakuru’s Silas Ouma registered the only knockout of the night in welterweight when he floored Kaloleni’s Amir Ahmed to emerge the winner. The charging Ouma went on offensive from the first gong, dismantling Ahmed’s weak defensive guard with deadly jabs that saw the Kaloleni boxer kiss the canvas in the second minute of the second round. “I’m happy to have won the fight in the shortest possible time. That was my game plan and I hope to work harder and win the national novices title,” said Ouma. Ahmed conceded defeat, saying: “He caught me with a devastating punch and that made the difference.” In middleweight, Nakuru boxers maintained their winning ways, with Mike Jared outpunching Kaloleni’s Philip Dodo to carry the day on majority points. The battle of the heavies was an all-Kaloleni affair and after three rounds of fierce exchange Edwin Oksimba emerged the winner after beating Valentine Mwinami to win the contest. Nakuru coach Mwangi was satisfied with the results saying his new charges were slowly learning the tricks of the game after a disastrous season. “We are undergoing lean times and I’m happy I am grooming a team for the future,” said coach Mwangi.
