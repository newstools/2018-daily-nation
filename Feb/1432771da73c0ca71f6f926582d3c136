Lawyers have postponed plans to boycott court sessions but its members will continue wearing a yellow ribbon to protest public officials' disobedience of court orders. In a statement, Lawyer Society of Kenya (LSK) President Isaac Okero said other forms of protest would continue but boycott of court sessions, which was to start Monday morning, has been pushed to “facilitate better preparation”. PROTEST “…upon further consultation it has been decided that the campaign shall proceed with all components save for the court boycott which stands postponed for now to facilitate better preparation,” the statement said. Mr Okero said lawyers would wear the yellow ribbon until “we see respect for rule of law restored”. The lawyers’ umbrella body had earlier called for boycott of court sessions, save for election petitions – which have strict timeliness – to protest a move by government officials to disregard court orders. MIGUNA Last week, the government deported lawyer Miguna Miguna despite a court order issued by Justice Luka Kimaru that he be produced in court. Later the police said they had released him, while the government said he was deported to Canada because he had renounced his Kenyan citizenship. Mr Okero further said lawyers would hold peaceful protest on February 15. The lawyers also plan to undertake “strategic litigation with a view to seeking in addition to appropriate orders and declarations, personal liability against the State and public officers who are acting or have acted with impunity”. “The position of the Law Society of Kenya is unequivocal: fidelity to the law is the solemn and patriotic obligation of ALL,” he said.   LSK President Isaac Okero says the government has failed in its mandate.
