Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has asked the government to restore signals of TV stations, which have been off air since Tuesday. Senator Moi told the government to obey a court order by High Court judge Justice Chacha Mwita ordering it to restore the signals of Citizen TV, NTV and KTN. Mr Moi, who is also the chairman of the Senate Committee on Information and Communication Technology, faulted the move by the government to switch off the stations, saying media freedom is enshrined in the Constitution, which State swore to abide by and protect. “This is an unfortunate step,” Mr Moi said in a statement on Friday. “Though the government has indicated that the stations are under investigations, they do not have to be off-air for investigations to go on. "Let them switch them on as investigations are done and if it turns out that they are culpable, action be taken at that point”. He also asked the State to guarantee journalists their safety and ensure that their working environment is free of intimidation and harassment.   The television stations are still switched off despite the High Court directive.
