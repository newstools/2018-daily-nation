A man is fighting for his life at Kenyatta National Hospital’s intensive care unit after a horrific hammer and nail attack in Nthambi Tharaka-Nithi County. Isaac Mutembei, 40, was attacked during a fight in a bar and is now paralysed on one side. According to his brother, Mr Jacob Munene, his brother had gone to the market on Monday for a drink at around 11am where he had a few drinks at a local bar. “My brother disagreed with another patron who is suspected to be mentally disturbed, and the two got into a brawl. He hit Isaac with a hammer on the head and he lost consciousness,” he said. Onlookers rushed out of the bar, thinking he was dead and some went to alert the police. Mutembei’s attacker was, however, not yet finished with him. HAMMERED NAILS “Using as hammer, he drove four nails into his skull at different points,” his brother added. Police officers who later came to the scene found him still alive and rushed him to Meru Level Five Hospital where doctors did a CT scan and referred him to KNH. “In Meru, doctors told us they could not conduct the intricate surgery to remove the nails,” Munene told Nation on Thursday. On Tuesday morning, he underwent a six-hour surgery to remove the nails before doctors induced a coma for two days. “I was called and told my brother had been rushed to the referral facility. “The paralysis, doctors said, was as a result of the impact of the hammer to the skull. They are, however, optimistic that Isaac will recover well,” Munene said.
