The National Hospital Insurance Fund is on the spot following the second cancellation of a tender in recent months. The latest is the stopping of a life insurance over procurement irregularities, affecting thousands of civil servants, police and prisons officers and their dependents. This is simply unacceptable. The NHIF members should never be denied services they are entitled to over basic administrative mistakes.  The Sh836 million insurance scheme cancelled last week by the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board came into force only last year. The board deserves to be commended for the decisive move that highlights the need to scrutinise these public tenders to protect taxpayers’ money. RAMPANT CORRUPTION Notably, it is the second NHIF tender that the board has had to revoke in less than two months. The NHIF management must fully understand that its mandate is a crucial one that needs to be handled with responsibility. The officials of such public institutions must, no doubt, always be fully aware of the rampant corruption in public procurement and the existence of cartels that seek to reap where they have not sown. This is an opportunity for Fund CEO Geoffrey Mwangi and his team to ensure that the irregularities that led to the cancellation of the important tender are eliminated. Should this happen again, they should take full responsibility. Transparency in public procurement is a must to curb wastage, and there is no shortcut.
