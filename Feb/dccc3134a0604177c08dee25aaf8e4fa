Parliament will next week on Thursday and Friday vet nine new nominees to the Cabinet. Twelve others who were either retained in their first-term dockets or moved to others will not be vetted following an advisory by Attorney-General Githu Muigai that re-assigned or re-appointed Cabinet secretaries need not be assessed afresh. The advisory was later reinforced by a ruling by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, and backed by Majority Leader Aden Duale. Mr Duale, who sits in the Committee on Appointments, has written a brief to back the move not to vet the CSs afresh. “Any appointment approved by the National Assembly would not require subsequent vetting if the reassignment is of the same nature and responsibility. "Consequently, serving Cabinet secretaries and principal secretaries who have been moved to other ministries or State departments will not require further approval of the House,” Mr Duale argued in the document. The committee’s report should be ready by February 13, when the House resumes from the long recess. Though National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi had expressed concern that even the re-assigned CSs should be vetted, he has since dropped the call, and instead said the opposition will opt out of the whole process. Nasa has not sent names to the committee on appointments that will vet the CSs, but Mr Muturi says this will not affect the process.   Prof Margaret Kobia (Public Service nominee) will be first to face the vetting panel on Thursday.
