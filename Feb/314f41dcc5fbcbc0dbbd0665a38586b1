Players from African nations started streaming into Nairobi on Tuesday for the ITTF Continental Cup that starts Thursday. Stars from Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, Algeria, Mauritius, Botswana, Ghana, Congo Brazzaville and Seychelles arrived Tuesday. Other players from Uganda, Tanzania, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire and Tunisia are expected today for the tournament that will also see players qualify for the 2019 World Table Tennis Championships. Kenya’s top seeded players — Sejal Thakkar and Brian Mutua — who will face the formidable opposition, have been training under Swede coach Jan Berner who arrived in Kenya on Thursday last week. Thakkar and Mutua, who are both seeded 15th in their respective competitions, will use the event to prepare for Gold Coast Commonwealth Games to be held from April 4 to 15. The 2019 World Table Tennis Championships will be held in Budapest, Hungary. TOOK A BREAK The 42-year-old Thakkar has represented Kenya for many years. The mother of two wore Kenya colours twice at the Commonwealth Games in 1998 (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) and 2014 (Glasgow, Scotland). Thakkar, who took a break in 1999 before returning to represent Kenya at the 2011 African Games in Maputo, represented Kenya the last time at the ITTF Eastern Region Championships last December in Mauritius. Mutua, 19, will be representing Kenya for the second time, having earned his maiden international capping at the Mauritius competition. Thakkar is taking part in her fourth World Table Tennis Championships qualifier after 1991 (Japan), 2012 (Germany) and 2014 (Japan). It’s first time Kenya is hosting the World Table Tennis Championships qualifier even though Nairobi got the privilege of hosting the Table Tennis World Cup in 1989. The draw for the championships will be done today at 6pm at Ibis Hotel, Westlands, Nairobi.   Omar is currently ranked 16th in the world.
