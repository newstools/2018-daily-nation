One hundred national police reservists (NPR) have been deployed along the border of Wajir East and Tarbaj sub-Counties in a bid to boost security. Last Friday, Al-Shabaab militants attacked Qarsa Primary School and killed three teachers. SECURITY Wajir County Commissioner Loyford Kibaara said the officers would assist in patrols in the schools along the Kenyan border with Somalia that have increasingly become a soft target. “Earlier today, we deployed 100 well-armed national police reservists to the border areas along Wajir East and Tarbaj sub-Counties,” he said. This move comes as non-local teachers continue to flee the schools in the border areas, disrupting classes. MASS EXODUS More than 15 schools have been affected by the mass exodus of non-local teachers, which has dealt a huge blow to the education sector in the county. More than 60 percent of teachers in Wajir County are non-locals and their exit could create a huge crisis in schools. Meanwhile, some non-local teachers from Habaswein Sub-County in Wajir on Monday protested the deteriorating security. The teachers also accused the sub-County of discrimination in regards to promotion and delayed transfers at the end of contract years. The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) continued to pressure the government to withdraw non-local teachers from schools in Northeastern region.   Knut threatens to withdraw non-local teachers if security does not improve.
