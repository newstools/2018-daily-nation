Property worth millions of shillings was destroyed Friday after fire burnt shops at Suneka in Kisii County. Traders said they lost property running into millions of shillings. “I lost an investment of 10 years. I don’t know if I may recover from this loss any time soon,” Mr Thomas Nyangoge, a furniture dealer, said. Ms Mary Matunda, a shoe vendor, said she had gone to Kisii Town to buy more stock only to return and find her shop destroyed. Witnesses said they suspected an electric fault. But Disaster Chief Officer Dorice Okango said they are yet to ascertain the cause of the fire. “We have started investigations,” she said. The incident comes four days after another fire razed more than 10 shops at Kisii Town’s Daraja Mbili market.
