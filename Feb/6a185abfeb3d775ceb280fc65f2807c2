The woman accused of stealing a baby at Kenyatta National Hospital will spend five more days and nights in cells, a Nairobi court has ruled. Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot ordered the lock-up when Ms Edinah Kemunto Mabuka appeared before him on Wednesday. This was after state prosecutors told the court that investigations into the case were ongoing. They suspect Ms Mabuka is part of a wide child theft and trafficking syndicate that has been stealing children at hospitals. The court also heard that investigators need to travel to Kisii and Bungoma counties to investigate the case as they look for potential witnesses. The suspect was arrested on Tuesday at Kongo in Nairobi's Kawangware area following a tip-off from a Good Samaritan. She will be detained at Kilimani Police Station.    Mr Job Ouko and Ms Jane Kerubo were elated after their baby was found.
