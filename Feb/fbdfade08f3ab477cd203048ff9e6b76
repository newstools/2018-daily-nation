Former presidential candidate and leader of Thirdway Alliance Kenya Ekuru Aukot has unveiled a 21-member shadow Cabinet to keep the government in check. It has nine women and 12 men. According to Mr Aukot who declared himself Kenya’s official opposition figure, the move is in line with a pledge he made during last year’s General Election to closely monitor the government if he lost in the polls. DEMOCRACY “We are aware that the shadow Cabinet is not anchored in the law but it is common of progressive democracies to contextualise that idea of keeping the State in check. In no way are we undermining the government but we must ensure President Uhuru’s promises are delivered,” he said. A total of 130 applications for different positions were made to Thirdway Alliance by January 30. Successful applicants were then engaged in a “process of conversation” to establish their motivation of wanting to join the shadow cabinet. In the final list according to Mr Aukot, regional balance, age, gender balance, competence and suitability and the youth factor were considered. Others picked were senior advisors in the different ministries. “You will see well educated Kenyans, with a fresh train of thought who meet the criteria on leadership and integrity as set out in Chapter 6 of our Constitution of Kenya, which also requires that those appointed to serve in the public office, must be people with competence and suitability to perform a function as assigned,” Mr Aukot said.
