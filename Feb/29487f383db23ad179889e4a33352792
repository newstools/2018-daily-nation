The northeastern and parts of the Coast regions continue to face deadly attacks by Somalia-based al-Shabaab terrorists and their local allies. The increasing involvement of locals in attacks is a major source of concern. The raid at a primary school in Wajir County, in which three Kenyans, two schoolteachers and the wife of one of them were killed, is a pointer to a homegrown threat that needs to be seriously fought. Indeed, this was also quite evident in the raid at Garissa University College in 2015, in which more than 150 students were killed. The masterminds, it turned out, were Kenyans. SAFETY Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed says that some guidelines have been formulated to ensure the safety of teachers and learners. This is laudable and long overdue. Three suspects believed to have led the attack in Wajir on Friday that claimed three lives are all Kenyans. The entire region bordering Somalia, including Lamu County, has seen intensified terror incidents. The insurgents have also knocked down mobile phone masts, cutting off communication between these parts and the rest of the country. In Isiolo County, quick action by police might just have foiled a terrorist attack following a gunfight in which one suspect was killed and two others arrested with a cache of arms, including 36 grenades and five automatic rifles. Police believe they were headed for targets in Nairobi. The rampant insecurity in this region calls for firm, robust and stern action by the security forces. There is a need for intensified vigilance.
