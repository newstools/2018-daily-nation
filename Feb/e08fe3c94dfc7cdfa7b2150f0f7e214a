Records and equipment worth millions of shillings have been destroyed after a fire broke out at the Kitui County government offices. Five departments of the county government were affected by the Sunday morning fire. The departments are housed in the private building leased by county government. The 1am fire consumed everything as there was no response from the fire department.
