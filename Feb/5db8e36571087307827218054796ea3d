Two people have been shot dead and one injured along the Iresaboru-Modogashe road in Isiolo County after armed bandits ambushed the vehicle they were travelling in. Garbatulla Deputy County Commissioner Kipchumba Rutto confirmed that bandits believed to be from Lagdera, Garissa County ambushed a Toyota Probox car carrying seven passengers which was plying the road.The attack happened three kilometres from Modogahse Township. Mr Rutto said he suspected that the ambush might have been a retaliatory attack by the bandits following the deaths of two of their own (herders) in Boji, Garbatulla Sub-County three weeks ago. CAR OWNER DEAD Among those shot dead were the owner of the vehicle and a 40-year-old herder from Garbatulla Sub-County. A girl was also injured and is receiving treatment at Lagdera Hospital, Garissa County. The other passengers are said to have fled during the attack. The DCC said police were pursing three suspects from Lagdera. Police officers from Sericho and Lagdera police stations are patrolling Modogashe and Iresaboru areas where shops are said to have been closed for fear of revenge attacks. “The armed bandits were aimlessly spraying bullets at the moving vehicle. We have enhanced patrol in the area to prevent further attacks as we [pursue] the suspects,” said Mr Rutto.
