Wilson Kipsang returns to defend his title at the 12th edition of the Tokyo Marathon Sunday with former winners Birhane Dibaba from Ethiopia and Kenyan Helah Kiprop leading the women’s field. Kipsang, a former world record holder, experienced mixed fortunes after his 2017 victory in Tokyo, dropping out of Berlin in September but bouncing back to finish second at the New York City Marathon in November. Already the course record holder in Tokyo, he’s aiming to better that tomorrow. His goal? 2:02:50. “My main aim is the world record,” said Kipsang, whose personal best is 2:03:13 set in 2016. “If the temperature and weather is ideal, then I will push the second half.” Last year he reached the midway point in 1:01:22, a pace he said was too ambitious. “It was little bit too fast. I want to go through the half marathon point in 61:40 this year, and then pick up the pace from there.” Interestingly, Kipsang will be paced by his brother, 29-year-old Noah Kiprotich. Kiprotich started with Kipsang since his elder brother returned from finishing second in last year’s New York Marathon. “When Kipsang came back after New York Marathon, he went for holiday for some few days before embarking on serious training up to now where we hope it will bring good results,” Kiprotich said earlier this week. Kiprotich said he is following his brother’s footsteps. “You can’t run forever in athletics and I want to fill in my brothers’ position when he retires as one way of maintaining our family name in sports,” said Kiprotich. Kiprop is confident of reclaiming her title. “I missed the 2017 edition because I was in the London Marathon line up but this year I will be looking forward to win again,” said Kiprop. Kiprop said that her training was good having started early preparations as she looks forward to a good season her goal being to lower her personal best of 2:21:29 she clocked in 2016. “I’m looking forward to a good season ahead and my training was good and what is remaining is to run on Sunday and taste our capabilities. I want to lower my personal best time of 2:21:29,” said Kiprop who is coached by her husband David Marus. First major victory Kipsang’s main competitors are Ethiopian Tsegaye Mekonnen, who has a 2:04:32 best from the 2014 Dubai Marathon, his compatriot Feyisa Lilesa, the 2016 Olympic silver medalist, and Kenyan Dickson Chumba, whose 2:04:32 personal best was set in the 2014 Chicago Marathon. Chumba won in Tokyo that year and has finished third in each subsequent edition. He’s also looking for a fast time as well as another podium finish. “I need to run 2:04, not 2:05,” he said. Following a third place finish at the 2011 World Championships, Feyisa won in Tokyo in 2016, the first major victory of his career. He has a 2:04:52 best from the 2012 Chicago Marathon, but hasn’t broken 2:10 since the Rio Olympic Games.
