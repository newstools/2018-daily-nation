Nasa has finally agreed on its list of members to the Parliamentary Service Commission. The opposition coalition, however, still faces an uphill task in getting it approved because of its internal wars and the Jubilee Party resolve. National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi said Monday he had nominated Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior and MPs Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay Woman Rep) and Aisha Jumwa (Malindi, ODM) to the powerful commission. Mr Mbadi said the Makueni senator had finally agreed to the proposed swap with Vihiga Senator George Khaniri, who would now be appointed the Minority Whip in the Senate. “As it is, the Speaker should treat my letter as having settled the matter. My letter now overrides any communication,” said Mr Mbadi. Majority Leader Aden Duale Monday suggested that Wiper’s push had the backing of the ruling party. “Wiper wrote a letter and attached serious documents,” he said of the communication by Wiper backed by minutes of the National Executive Committee meeting. PSC positions are coveted because they come with influence on employment in Parliament, oversight over a large budget, Sh40,000 allowance per every commission meeting, travel abroad, a vehicle, a spacious office and staff.
