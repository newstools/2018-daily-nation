The annual corruption perceptions index, released by Transparency International (TI), has ranked Kenya number 143 of 180 countries that were included in the index for the year 2017. The index, which ranks countries on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), awarded Kenya a score of 28 â”€ a slight improvement from 2016 and 2015 when the country was given 26 and 25 points, respectively. EACC TI Kenya Executive Director Samuel Kimeu said failure to punish individuals implicated in graft continues to be a major stumbling block. Incompetence and ineffectiveness of anti-corruption agencies also attributed to the poor ranking, Mr Kimeu said. Among the East Africa Community countries, Rwanda was the top performer with a score of 55 at position 48. Tanzania was second with a score of 36 at position 103 followed by Kenya and Uganda which was position 151 with 26 points. Burundi is the worst performing in the region with a score of 22 points at position 157. Mr Kimeu said Kenya's score is still lower than the combined average score for Africa which is 32.
