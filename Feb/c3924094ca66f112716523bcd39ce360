Seasoned middle distance runner Winny Chebet is the latest inclusion in Team Kenya for the World Indoor Championships slated for March 2 to 4 in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Chebet, who cracked a personal best of 4 minutes and 07.86 seconds during the second leg of the 2018 World Indoor Tour in Dusseldorf, Germany on February 6, has been drafted in the 1,500m race. Beatrice Chepkoech, who won in Dusseldorf in 4:04.21, completed a double with victory in the final leg of the World Tour in Glasgow on Sunday to get a direct entry to the championship. Her direct entry freed up on slot for Kenya that has now been filled by Chebet Athletics Kenya senior vice president Paul Mutwii, who is in charge of competitions, said even though Chebet had been entered for both 800m race and 1,500m she will only run the metric mile race. Chebet will be gunning for her first major silverware since winning silver in 800m outdoor during the 2005 World Youth and 2006 World Junior Championships. It will be the first time the 27-year-old Chebet is competing for Kenya at the World Indoor. She reached the semi-finals of the 1,500m at both the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and 2017 London World Championships. Besides Chepkoech, Kenya’s Bethwell Birgen also won his 1,500m race in Glasgow on Sunday. Birgen clocked 3:37.76 to win men’s 1,500m brushing aside compatriot Vincent Kibet in 3:37.88 as Ryan Gregson from Australia timed 3:38.00 for third place. Birgen will team up with Davis Kiplagat in 3,000m at the World Indoors while Kibet will race in men’s 1,500m at the World Indoor. Kiplangat was placed fourth in 7:40.12 in the 3,000m race in Glasgow where fast-rising Justus Soget of Kenya stunned a rich field to win in 7:39.09.
