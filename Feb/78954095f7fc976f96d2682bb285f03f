The High Court in Kitale has dismissed an election petition challenging Trans-Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba’s win. Justice Anthony Mrima said there was insufficient evidence to quash the election and ordered the petitioners to pay Sh10 million in costs – Sh5 million to be paid to the IEBC and Sh5 million to be paid to Mr Khaemba. IRREGULARITIES Justice Mrima, however, urged the IEBC to be more organised and put more effort in planning elections. He said the irregularities, though minimal, were mostly as a result of non-compliance with regulations. Justice Mrima also urged political parties and independent candidates to train their agents. Two voters – Robinson Simiyu Manga and Alpha Kitazi Chore – moved to court to challenge the validity of his election, citing a number of irregularities. Mr Khaemba welcomed the court ruling. "This case has wasted our time and resources but the court ruling has demonstrated that it was all lies," said Mr Khaemba. He was with Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang’ula, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa and Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi. PETITION Meanwhile, the High Court in Nyahururu upheld the election of Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal.   Judge Roseline Wendoh dismissed the petition challenging his election on grounds that it lacked merit. Former Samburu North MP Simeon Lesirma had moved to court seeking orders to invalidate Mr Lenolkulal's election, arguing that the poll was marred by massive irregularities. Justice Wendoh ordered the petitioner to pay Sh6 million as costs for the case.   MPs Mose, Arama, Waluke, Ogutu and Amin win petitions filed against their wins.
