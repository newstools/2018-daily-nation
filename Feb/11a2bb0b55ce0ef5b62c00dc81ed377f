Leaders in Nyeri County led by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary nominee Mwangi Kiunjuri have ruled out dialogue with Nasa on fresh elections demanding that they acknowledge President Kenyatta’s legitimacy. The leaders, among them Governor Mutahi Kahiga, MPs Rigathi Gachagua and Wambugu Ngunjiri, also defended the government’s decision to ignore court orders. Police have been on the spot for ignoring court orders issued by various judges in the recent crackdown on Nasa leaders. Mr Kiunjuri said the opposition should not lecture the government on respecting court while it had illegally taken part in “swearing-in” Nasa principal Raila Odinga as the "people’s president". “Today you want to lecture Kenyans and the government on the rule of law but tomorrow in broad daylight you are breaking the same. We must respect the government of the day,” he said. Mr Kiunjuri supported a statement issued by foreign envoys asking Mr Odinga to recognise the legitimacy of President Kenyatta government after the repeat presidential election on October 26, 2017. The leaders were attending the county’s fourth prayer breakfast meeting at Green Hills Hotel in Nyeri.
