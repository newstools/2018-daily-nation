The Law Society of Kenya has moved countrywide demonstrations to protest against the disobedience of court directives by government officials to Thursday. The LSK president, Isaac Okero, on Sunday said upon further consultation, they decided demonstrations by way of peaceful protest marches begin on Thursday. “For avoidance of doubts it is reiterated that the Yellow Ribbon Campaign shall proceed from February 15, 2018,” he said. Earlier, Mr Okero had announced that lawyers would hold a protest starting on Monday. He said the government, which should demonstrate to citizens the importance of adhering to the law, had failed in its mandate. According to Mr Okero, it is very difficult to expect citizens to respect the law when the government shows contempt. The LSK president said lawyers will wear yellow ribbons until the respect for the rule of law is restored. The demonstrations will also involve undertaking of strategic litigation with a view to seeking personal liability against the State and public officers who are acting or have acted with impunity. Mr Okero said the position of the Law Society of Kenya is unequivocal.   Police boss denies violating the law and constitutional rights of the politicians.
