Deputy President William Ruto has defended Eurobond II and the government’s growing appetite for external loans. In his first public response to the outrage that greeted Eurobond II, Mr Ruto on Friday said the  Sh200 billion secured on Thursday in London would be spent on development, not scandals. The heavy loans, he said, would be used to fund the Jubilee government’s Big Four Agenda. “Any borrowing has been measured and one that can be repaid,” he said at Kiawara in Nyeri County, adding that the government will continue to borrow despite criticism from the opposition. “Jubilee will not be involved in politics that divide the country. 2022 (General Election) will only be relevant if we will have improved the livelihood of Kenyans.”  More follows.
