Ongoing renovation work at Bomu Stadium in Changamwe, Mombasa County, will be complete before end of this month, Mombasa County Chief Executive Officer for Youth, Gender and Sports, Rajab Babu, has said. On Thursday, Babu led a delegation in an inspection tour of the facility and assured sports fans from the area that the facility would soon be ready for use. “After inspecting the ongoing works, I wish to assure the local football fraternity that the upgrading of Bomu Stadium will be completed one and a half weeks from now,” Babu said on Thursday. “I’m happy with the ongoing works. The contractor is working round the clock to deliver the facility in time. Work is in its finals stages, and laying of the carpet has been done,” Babu added. Babu, himself a Dutch and Brazil-trained coach, said that the 3,000-seater Bomu Stadium meets the minimum requirement to host local and international matches. Babu said former Kenyan internationals will play a match against former players of Tanzanian national team to mark the opening of the facility. National Super League team Modern Coast Rangers, through its secretary Ferdinand Ogot, has requested Football Kenya Federation to allow the team to move its home matches from Mbaraki Sports Club to Bomu in the new season. However, Rangers might use Mbaraki for its match against KCB on February 17 should reconstruction of Bomu Stadium take longer.
