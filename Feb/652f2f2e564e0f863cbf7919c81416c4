A perennial problem that makes a mockery of education reform is the tendency to force pupils to repeat classes. This is motivated by the need by some schools to improve their mean score in national exams, but it’s a violation of the rights of pupils. Many are held back and bypassed by their peers, and yet it is clear as night and day that not all can score the top grades. Indeed, there would be no need to set such an exam, in the first place. The teachers, especially the school heads involved in this devious scheme, are aware of the adverse consequences of forcing pupils to repeat. They are also aware of a government ban. At some point, the practice was so rampant that only a few bright children would be registered for exams. And it got worse, with some schools registering their weak pupils elsewhere so that their mean score would not be affected. To its credit, the Education ministry has stopped some of these weird exam tricks, with the ranking of schools abolished to discourage the cut-throat competition between schools. The findings of a study conducted by the Kenya National Examination Council are hardly surprising. They indicate that repetition among Standard Six pupils rose from 48.2 per cent in 2007, to 53.3 per cent in 2013. And it’s not going to end soon. This interference with the normal transition must be stopped.
