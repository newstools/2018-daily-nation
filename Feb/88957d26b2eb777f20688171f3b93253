Police in Kitui on Monday arrested and questioned the County Executive for Environment John Makau over last week's torching of a truck ferrying charcoal. Mr Makau was summoned to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices in Kitui on Monday afternoon alongside county community liaison officer David Mbisi. CUSTODY The two senior county officers spent the night in custody, awaiting arraignment in court. County DCI boss Prosper Bosire confirmed the arrests, saying his detectives were looking for more suspects in connection with the incident. “We arrested two county officers and questioned them over their alleged involvement in the burning of a charcoal truck at Kanyonyoo,” Mr Bosire told the Nation on the phone. He said they would be arraigned at the Embu law courts on Wednesday to face charges of arson and property destruction. INVESTIGATIONS Mr Bosire said investigations had established more people were involved in the arson and they would be arrested regardless of their status in society. He, however, said the police crackdown on the arson suspects was not aimed at frustrating the Kitui County Government’s ban on charcoal trade. It is aimed at maintaining law and order and protecting people's property, Mr Bosire said. “The county government can continue enforcing its ban but we won’t allow trucks passing through Kitui, from other counties where charcoal trade is allowed and legal, to be attacked by people taking the law into their hands,” he said. The charcoal truck was burnt on Wednesday last week after it was impounded along the Mwingi-Nairobi highway. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu had launched a crackdown on charcoal trade.   It is meant to protect Kitui from environmental degradation, she says.
