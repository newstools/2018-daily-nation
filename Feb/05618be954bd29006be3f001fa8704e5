The capital markets regulator has issued an online foreign exchange licence to Execution Point Limited, the first such authorisation under new regulations that came into force late last year. Execution Point, which is a local subsidiary of British firm Davisa UK Limited, has been granted a non-dealing online foreign exchange broker licence, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday. The firm will “link” clients to markets by providing a platform to trade in foreign exchange, though the firm is not allowed to engage in selling and buying of currency. Non-dealing foreign exchange brokers are required to have a minimum paid-up capital of Sh30 million, money managers must have a paid up capital of Sh10 million while dealing online brokers face the highest capital requirement of Sh50 million.
