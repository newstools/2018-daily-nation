The promise of South Sudan as the new frontier for regional trade and investment has been battered by a raging political and armed conflict. As a result, the immense potential that would have been of great benefit to the South Sudanese and their neighbours remains in abeyance. During their struggle for independence, which culminated in their separation from the north, there were many South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries. Some still own homes and properties in Nairobi and South Sudanese children go to Kenyan schools. Kenyans, naturally, expected the independent South Sudanese to reciprocate the generosity. Unfortunately, increasing tales of harassment, arrests and even killing of Kenyans in that country have soured relations. It had also been expected that, with Juba admitted to the East African Community (EAC), relations with its neighbours would improve. Sadly, that has not happened. Recently, four Kenyans jailed over seemingly trumped up charges were released but after lengthy negotiations. Also bound to further heighten the hostility is the capture of two Kenyan pilots whose plane crashed in rebel-held territory. They are back home after several weeks. There is an urgent need to solve the political conflict in South Sudan for the newest nation to forge closer ties and boost trade with its neighbours.
