Security forces have repulsed an attack by suspected Al-Shabaab militants at Special Forces Camp in Kutulo, Wajir County commander Stephen Ngetich has said. Mr Ngâ€™etich said the attackers invaded the Special forces camp at around 8pm, resulting into a one and a half hours gun battle that ended with the assailants retreating. "We are waiting for confirmation of the extent of the damage and also if there were any casualties." The force is a combination of elite officers drawn from the Administration Police, mainly the Rapid Deployment Unit, and Regular Police. Early last month, Shabaab destroyed a mast belonging to telecommunications firm Safaricom, paralysing communication. This article will be updated as more details become available.
