Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet has said the crackdown on opposition politicians will continue despite criticism and protests. Speaking at Kiganjo Police Training College Nyeri on Friday, the police boss put the politicians on notice that they will not be spared in enforcement of the law and order in the country. “We are serving the people in a constitutional manner. Break the law and face the consequences. We will arrest them,” said Mr Boinnet. He was accompanied by his two deputies Noor Gabow who is charge of Administration Police and Edward Mbugua of Kenya Police among other senior officers in the police service. He further denied violating law and constitutional rights of the politicians who have so far been netted and summoned in the crackdown that started after swearing in of Opposition leader Raila Odinga. “We are matching ahead and no going back. We are serving the people in accordance with the constitution,” said Mr Boinnet. He spoke during the first ever National Police Service open day, noting that other similar events will be held at Embakasi Administration Police College and the General Service Unit College.   Detectives declined to record their statements because "they are not persons of interest”.
