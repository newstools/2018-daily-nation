Five people died and five others injured after a shuttle collided with a truck at Kikopey on Nairobi-Nakuru highway on Monday night. Two passengers of the North Rift shuttle, travelling from the capital Nairobi, died on the spot, according to Gilgil Officer Commanding Police Division Serah Koki. Three of the eight who were hurt in the collision succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment at St Mary's Mission Hospital in Gilgil. The crash involved four trucks and a North Rift shuttle, all heading towards Nakuru town. According to Mr John Kiragu, a witness, the truck lost control before ramming the rear side of the shuttle. “The lorry seemed to have developed mechanical problems. The matatu in turn bumped into other three trucks,” he said. Transport along the busy highway was temporarily disrupted as police moved in to clear the wreckages that had blocked the busy road. The wreckages were towed to Gilgil Police Station.
