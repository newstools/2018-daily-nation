Nasa leader Raila Odinga has hit out at the Jubilee leadership over what he termed blatant violation of the Constitution and human rights. He said the administration has disobeyed court orders and police have harassed opposition leaders. ‘HOSTAGE’ Mr Odinga also said President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration had "held hostage" various government bodies, leaving citizens helpless. He cited the Judiciary, electoral commission and Parliament. The Opposition Chief spoke on Saturday in Vihiga during the burial of Justus Etale, the father of ODM Communications Director Philip Etale. The former Prime Minister said was making his second public address since he was ‘sworn in’ as the people’s president on January 30. The first was in Nairobi during the funeral service of Ms Yvonne Wamalwa, the widow of former Vice President Michael Kijana Wamalwa. ADDRESS His ‘oath’ has led to the government cracking down on opposition politicians close to him. But speaking in Vihiga, Mr Odinga said: "We are relying on Article 1 of the Constitution that says sovereignty lies in the people of Kenya.” "The people can exercise it directly or indirectly but our competitors are doing the opposite. They have grabbed power and held government bodies hostage. "The state has become rogue. They are blatantly violating court orders and using the police to intimidate people," he added. CHANGE Mr Odinga assured his supporters that "things are going to change". "We are going to hold the people's convention soon. I will discharge my duties as the people's president without fear," he said. Other leaders present at the funeral included Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo, Senators Amos Wako (Busia), Cleophas Malala (Kakamega) and George Khaniri (Vihiga). Luanda MP Chris Omulele, Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi and a host of ODM officials were also at the funeral.   In a three minute BBC interview, Mr Odinga maintained that he did not recognise Mr Kenyatta as the President.
