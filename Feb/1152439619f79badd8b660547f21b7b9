The High Court has upheld the August 8, 2017 election victory of Garissa Township MP Aden Duale. Justice Hedwig Ongundi on Tuesday dismissed bribery claims by the petitioner, former National Assembly Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim. BRIBERY In his judgment, judge Ong’udi said Mr Duale was validly elected and claims by Mr Maalim that some voters were denied a chance to cast their votes were not true. He dismissed Mr Maalim's claim that Mr Duale influenced the recruitment of presiding officers and other poll officials. Garissa Township is the constituency in northern part of Kenya with the largest number of registered voters, at 54,000. Mr Maalim challenged Mr Duale’s win, stating that there were massive irregularities in the outcome. He has also claimed that voters were bribed although he could not state where it occurred and when. DEFENCE "I didn't see the bribery literary or anyone being bribed but I saw a crowd negotiating," he had told the court during the hearing of the case. Mr Duale had defended his win, stating that all the results announced and declared at all polling stations in Garissa Township were correct and lawful. He added that the results were a true reflection of the will of voters in the said constituency. Mr Duale has also denied Mr Maalim's claim that he used public officers to compel voters to vote for him. He poked holes holes in his rival's case, arguing that Mr Maalim failed to table evidence to back his allegations.
