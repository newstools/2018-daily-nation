Deputy President William Ruto on Friday said Jubilee Party will not focus on opposition leader Raila Odinga’s  demands. He said the party will instead focus on delivering what they promised in their manifesto. The DP said Nasa leaders were only interested in inciting Kenyans to violence with a view to causing bloodshed and loss of lives. “Kenyans, more so Jubilee leaders, should avoid useless political debates about Nasa, and focus on delivering our promises” he said. He spoke when he commissioned the construction of 100km Karandi-Marigat road  at Kabel in Baringo South, and Makutano-Konyao-Alae Road in West Pokot. “We have better things to do other than engaging in cheap politics pushed by the opposition, which does not respect the Constitution,” he said.
