The three-month government ban on logging in all forests across the country is not only commendable but should, indeed, have come a lot earlier. The consequences of the dwindling forest cover call for serious national attention. Interestingly, the ban was announced by Deputy President William Ruto, who not long ago was involved in a public altercation over the conservation of the Mau Forest water tower. Then, Mr Ruto robustly defended the invasion of the forest for cultivation, dismissing the well-founded notion that a major cause of the declining rainfall is the destruction of its water towers. Kenya’s forest cover is only 1.7 per cent, far below the recommended minimum of 10 per cent. The DP has, apparently, had a rethink, having seen the devastation and with first-hand information from his vantage position. He acknowledged that the water levels in major rivers continue to drop at alarming levels. The three months might not be enough to correct the damage, especially by illegal loggers, but it’s a step in the right direction. The short moratorium should provide an opportunity for more appropriate measures. It’s noteworthy, therefore, that the National Assembly’s Environment Committee is backing the ban. We agree with the committee on the need for an agency to carry out an audit and chart the way forward. However, time is running out and a more practical approach is badly needed to reverse the sorry situation.
