A chief from Kisumu County has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for repeatedly defiling a 14 year-old girl in Seme-Sub County in 2015. The chief had been charged on June 9, 2015 with defiling the girl, who is an orphan staying with her widowed grandmother. Senior Principal Magistrate Dolphin Okundi found the accused guilty in a case where four prosecution witnesses including the child, her grandmother, a medical officer and the investigations officer testified. The medical officer told the court that after examination, he found that there was evidence of defilement. DISMISSED CLAIMS Two defence witnesses, who included the accused, dismissed the allegations of indecently touching the minor as mere claims. “The prosecution presented water tight case and I am convinced there is substantial evidence linking him to defilement. The defendant is hereby sentenced to 20 years in prison,” said Mrs Okundi. The chief was found to have sexually abused the then Standard Six pupil from 9am to 4pm. GOING TO CHURCH The minor was going to church when the administrator lured her into his house, claiming that he wanted to send her to the shop. The incident shocked the entire Kombewa District with residents demanding that the chief be paraded before the public as a way of subjecting him to “public shame”. After the judgement was delivered at 4 pm on Wednesday, the court’s premises was treated to drama as some locals celebrated while relatives of the chief wailed uncontrollably.
