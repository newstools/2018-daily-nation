World Under-18 3,000m silver medallist Edward Zakayo and African Games 5,000m champion Margaret Chelimo on Saturday won their respective 5,000m races during the national trials for the Commonwealth Games at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. The "Club" Games are due April 4-15 in Gold Coast, Australia. Zakayo engaged in a thrilling three-horse battle with Nicholas Kipkorir and 2010 World Junior 5,000m champion David Bett after the bell before he prevailed in 13 minutes and 28.2 seconds. Zakayo, who is also in the junior team for the Africa Cross Country Championships due March 17 in Algeria, edged out Kipkorir to second place in 13:32.7 as Bett, the 2009 World Under-18 3,000m silver medallist, settled third in 13:34.7 to claim the last slot in the men's 5000m team. "I thank God for his mercies. I had trained well heading into cross country and then these trials," said Zakayo, who is targeting gold in Gold Coast. "I must say this is a steady rise to the senior level." KASAIT MISSES OUT Chelimo clocked 15:51.2 to triumph, beating upcoming athlete Eva Cherono to second place in 15:54.6. They will now be joined by World 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri, who got a wild card for the "Club" Games. World Cross Country bronze medallist Lilian Kasait finished third to miss out. "It feels good to make Team Kenya for the third time but we need to improve on our speed and endurance especially in the last lap," said Chelimo. "This is a surprise to me since I really didn't expect to finish second and make the team," said Cherono, who has scaled from 1,500m races.   It was a thriller as Chebet got in front at the bell but Ndiwa caught up with her with 300m to go.
