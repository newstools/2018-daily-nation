At least 247 Mombasa Port casual labourers are seeking to be rehired after they were laid off nine years ago during a restructuring. The former casual workers, commonly known as white card workers, said they have been jobless since 2009 when they were laid off and have been in and out of court in an effort to have their jobs back. SUFFERING Spokesperson Joseph Ayoro said they have been suffering. “Many of us have had great difficulties in educating our children, some have even failed to transit to high school and colleges due to our financial constraints,” Mr Ayoro said in a press briefing. He said attempts by Dock Workers Union (DWU) Secretary-General Simon Sang to put up a case against the Kenya Ports Authority in 2017 bore no fruit as the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Mombasa said it was yet to determine whether the suit is time barred or whether the claimant (DWU) lacks locus standi to bring the suit on behalf of the 247 workers. UNHAPPY The workers who converged at Mama Ngina Drive on Saturday morning urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to order their reinstatement. “We are particularly unhappy to note that since we were laid off, KPA has still been absorbing subordinates from time to time and granting then permanent terms yet the principle of natural justice would require that we 247 be given priority,” Mr Ayoro added. He said the 63 women and 184 men are experienced dock workers and had worked at the port for nearly 10 years. Mr Ayoro added that none had a record of being laid off for non-performance or misconduct. Mrs Mwagakitu Suleiman said: “We do not know what will be our fate as our issue has been tabled before a parliamentary committee, the courts, and still there is no progress. Even with the opening of the container terminals we are still languishing out here in poverty.”
