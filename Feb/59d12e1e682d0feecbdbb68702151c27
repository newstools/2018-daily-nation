Two inmates at Nyeri Prison, King’ong’o, were Monday morning shot by a senior prison warder in unclear circumstances. According to senior officers at the medium prison, the two were shot “by accident” at the parking lot as they prepared to go for medical check-up. They were shot with one bullet, which hit one in the hand and the other in the backside. Central Regional Deputy Prison Commander Stephen Kiplagat confirmed the shooting but said the senior warder’s pistol misfired. “The officer was testing the firearm after receiving it as he was starting his shift,” Mr Kiplagat said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the gun went off and the inmates were injured. Maybe there was a bullet in the chamber when he received the gun from the armoury.” INSIDE A CELL Circumstances surrounding the shooting, however, are questionable as the officers could not explain why the warder was testing a loaded gun at the parking lot. An insider, however, claimed that the shooting occurred inside a cell in the main prison. Procedurally, warders are not supposed to carry firearms inside the prison area as a safety and precautionary measure. The source, who requested to remain anonymous as they were not supposed to address the media, also alleged a cover-up bid by the officers, who had refused to take the injured inmates for treatment. The two were, however, taken to Nyeri County Referral Hospital, where they were admitted.
