Hello Brenda, I’m 29 years old and a father of one. I’m based in Nyeri. My problem is a colleague who likes calling me to say "hi" every day at late night. She can call me even at 11.30pm late night to inquire me how my day has been. Even if it was a day we spent together serving clients in the bank. I have been ignoring her late night calls sometimes but she always follows this up with texts asking if I was okay. This is baffling as we are not even close at work. She says he has no hidden agenda. Should I believe her? Both of you are in terrible denial. Do you have feelings for this woman, or is there something she is hindering in your own life, like another woman? I doubt you would be writing in if you didn't feel something. Then again, you sound more confused than infatuated, so maybe you like her, and you like the attention, just not enough to do anything about it. You're just not that into her. So if you do a little soul searching and decide you might actually want to pursue this further, maybe it's time to inform her that you've noticed her behaviour towards you, and you would like to go out on a date with her to get to know her better. If she says no, well, at least you tried, and now you can stop feeling obligated to pick up pseudo booty calls.  Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   Beautiful women have approached me for dates but I am too afraid to flirt.
