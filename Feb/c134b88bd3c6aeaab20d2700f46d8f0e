Police on Thursday fired in the air to disperse angry traders who had blocked the Mombasa-Malindi highway after their shops were demolished by the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA). They lit bonfires and engaged police in running battles. Kisauni OCPD Sangura Musee said the chairman of the traders' organisation was arrested for incitement. Transport was disrupted for more than two hours as police put out the bonfires. The stalls, at Light terminus near Nyali Bridge, were destroyed in the morning. KeNHA coast regional director Jared Makori said the traders had encroached on a road reserve and had been notified about the demolition in November last year. “We informed them that we want to expand the road but they have been hesitant. We cannot stop development for the sake of a few people,” Mr Makori said at the scene. Mr Makori said the recovery of road reserves will continue. One of the traders said that they had not been informed about the demolition. “....This is not fair at all. They should at least have told us. We just saw our structures being demolished,” Mr Jacob Mwololo said.
