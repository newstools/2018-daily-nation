For the umpteenth time, our football has been thrown into a tailspin with Monday’s resignation of national team coach Paul Put. Despite helping reclaim the regional challenge cup just three months ago, the Belgian appeared frustrated and threw in the towel just when Kenyans were raising their hopes in Harambee Stars. Obviously, the withdrawal of the national team’s chief sponsors, SportPesa, left a huge dent in Football Kenya Federation’s coffers and the federation is struggling to run its various programmes. This despite the government’s assurance that the national Treasury would fill in the financial gaps left by the cancellation of the sponsorship deal. Indeed, this is one of the priorities that newly appointed Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa must now focus on. He must get the Sports Fund up and running as prescribed in the Sports Act, and also find practical ways of ensuring the self-sustainability of the different teams and federations. Echesa must now ensure that a suitable coach for the national team is appointed as soon as possible to fill the void left by Put. The Stars are eager to make a return to the Africa Cup of Nations next year and to do so, they require adequate preparations, which can’t be sustained by such a high turnover of coaches.
