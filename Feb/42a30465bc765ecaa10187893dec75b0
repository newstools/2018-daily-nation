The 2018 Kenya National Rally Championship revved off in Nakuru on Saturday morning As of the end of SS4 at the Top Fry Nakuru Rally, the battle for the first title this season was between teammates Baldev Chager and Onkar Rai. Chager led Rai by just 11 seconds, followed by national champion Ian Duncan, Manvir Baryan, Jassi Chatthe and local hero Carl 'Flash' Tundo. Twenty two cars started the event, with the major feature being the electronic timing imported from Bulgaria to help the organisers bring the latest technology to the sport in Kenya.
