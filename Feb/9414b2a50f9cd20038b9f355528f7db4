Anti-Doping Norway concluded a training session for Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya educators in Nairobi on Monday as part of the recently-signed partnership between the two agencies in the fight against use of banned performance-enhancing substances in Kenya. The training was aimed at refreshing skills and providing Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (Adak) educators with an avenue to benchmark with best practice. Speaking during the training’s closing ceremony, Adak chairman James Waweru said the move was an actualisation of part of the partnership agreement signed between the two agencies. Adak’s director of anti-doping education and research Agnes Mandu said the training had refined the critical education skills possessed by the educators. “We have experienced remarkable growth in the manner in which our educators have been conducting their business since the last training we had with Anti-Doping Norway in November, 2016. “Before then, our training method was mainly one-way and designed as lectures. Since our engagement with our partners from Norway we have reinforced and diversified our delivery methods to include outreach, values based and workshop programmes,” said Mandu. Lead trainer Ann Engelstad, who is also an advisor on international relations at Anti-Doping Norway, said Kenya had done well in the fight against doping. “I must say that Kenya has done extraordinarily well in the area of anti-doping education in particular and in the fight against doping generally," she said. “I witnessed their capabilities after sitting through a whole day workshop for handball athletes and I give the educators a thumbs for a job well done. What I saw is a team of dedicated men and women with the passion for the promotion of clean sport in their country. The mastery of issues and their mode of delivery of anti-doping messages is a clear pointer that they have perfected their act,” said Ann. She was accompanied by Siri Brynke, who is an Educator at ADNO.
