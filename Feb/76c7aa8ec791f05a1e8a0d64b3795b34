Geoffrey Kamworor reminded his rivals who the king is after strolling to a third senior men's 10km Lotto/Athletics Kenya National Cross Country Championships title at Uhuru Gardens on Saturday. The two-times World Cross champion, who holds the 2014 and 2016 national titles, broke away from the rest of the field just after four kilometres to triumph in 28 minutes and 32.9 seconds.     However, Kamworor tore into Kenya Police Service Athletics management for "failing to recognise" his` achievements despite having won two World Cross Country and World Half Marathon titles besides the 2015 World 10,000m silver medal. "I am disappointed that I have competed for Police for many years but they have never recognised me. This is the last time I am competing for them," said Kamworor, who is a corporal. "I want to thank Kenyans who have supported me all these years but I am unhappy that my employer has never seen anything good in me." Kamworor had after the race wanted to present his case to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett, who unfortunately had left. Kamworor said Police have never promoted him despite his achievements. "My colleagues have been promoted several times yet I have achieved more than them," said Kamworor. BARKACH SECOND Kamworor edged out Alfred Barkach from Central Rift to second place in 28:42.9 as Central's Macharia Ndirangu came in third in 28:49.3. Kamworor will, however, not make the Africa Cross Country Championships team since he is preparing to defend his World Half Marathon on March 24 in Valencia, Spain. The continental cross country is due March 17 in Chlef, Algeria. Emmanuel Bor (Central Rift) came in fourth in 28:52.5 and was followed by John Chepkwony (KDF) and Josphat Bett (Police) in fifth and sixth places in 28:57.3 and 28:58.3 respectively.
