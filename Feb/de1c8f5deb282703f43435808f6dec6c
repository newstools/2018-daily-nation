Schools are racing against time to provide details of students to the government for provision of personal student identification numbers. The schools have until February 20 to provide the details with private schools now asking for more time, saying most schools have not received codes to help them upload the details. The Ministry of Education has developed a comprehensive National Education Management Information System that is expected to give timely, accurate and reliable data to support evidence based policy development in the sector. “We are on track and hope to complete the exercise as was directed by the government,” said Kenya Primary School Heads Association (Kepsha) chairman Shem Ndolo (left). However, Kenya Private Schools Association chief executive Peter Ndoro said some schools may not beat the deadline. “Private schools are excited with the programme; we are implementing it. However, a few schools do not have codes and thus may need seven more days to complete the exercise,” said Mr Ndoro. According to Education Principal Secretary Dr Belio Kipsang, the development will enable the ministry to capture critical data on students. Dr Kipsang hailed the new system, adding: “In the past we have been collecting data manually, but this year we have transcended to the e-platform for data collection, marking the beginning of a new digital dispensation in data management.”
