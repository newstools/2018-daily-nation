A total of 141 Nasa MPs yesterday sued the government for revoking their firearm licences and withdrawing their security personnel. Through lawyer Peter Kaluma, they sued the Inspector-General of Police, the Firearms Licensing Board and Mr Samwel Kimaru its secretary. They have termed the move unlawful, unfair and discriminatory and therefore want the  decision revoked. “The implementation of the decision puts a dire risk to the personal safety and the lives of the said MPs while unduly curtailing their free and due discharge of their constitutional functions as MPs,” said Mr Kaluma. The State withdrew the MPs’ security detail over their involvement in Nasa leader Raila Odinga’s “oath” ceremony on Tuesday last week at Nairobi’s Uhuru Park. They have accused the State of not giving reasons for the withdrawal of security personnel and not taking into consideration their right on provision of security. The lawmakers argued that this was contrary to the rules of natural justice and contrary to their legitimate expectations. In a January 30 notice, the board revoked firearm certificates for several Nasa MPs with Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati and former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama moving to court last week to challenge the decision. Mr Arati managed to get a temporary order suspending the decision requiring him to surrender his firearms. The notice gave the MPs until the end of the day on February 1 to surrender their firearms. “In accordance with the Provisions of the Firearms Act Cap 114, your Firearm Certificate No 10242 issued to you on November 12, 2015 is with effect from the date of this notice revoked as the board is satisfied that the revocation is warranted  for reasons that you are unfit to be entrusted with a firearm any more,” read the notice issued by Mr Kimaru.   Minority Whip Junet Mohammed accuses executive of using State organs to perpetuate impunity.
