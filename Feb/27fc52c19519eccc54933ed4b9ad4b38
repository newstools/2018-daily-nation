New Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko has warned Kenya Forest Service personnel over massive illegal logging in government forests. Mr Tobiko on Monday warned that he would weed out rogue KFS rangers and empower those found fit to fully protect forests, water towers and wetlands. He said he was unhappy with reports that forest rangers were colluding with traders and harvesting timber in government forests without permits. He said millers who would be caught logging beyond their permits would be prosecuted for economic sabotage. "There are saw millers who are not following the laid down procedure. Their licences will have to be revoked," he said as he assumed office at Mazingira House in Nairobi. Mr Tobiko said environmental conservation is a matter of life and death and asked officers in his ministry to take their work seriously. He said communities living around water towers would be empowered in conservation, saying the majority care about the environment. He also challenged Nema to enforce ban on plastic bags and crack down on manufactures and users found breaching it. Kenya banned the importation, sale and use of plastic bags in 2017. Mr Tobiko, the former director of public prosecutions, later took over the environment docket from Prof Judi Wakhungu. In the Cabinet changes announced by President Kenyatta, Prof Wakhungu was appointed Kenya's ambassador to France.
