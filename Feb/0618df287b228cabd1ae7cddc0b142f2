Muhoroni Youth chairman Moses Adagala claims the problems facing his club are linked to his decision not to 'support' Nick Mwendwa during the 2016 Football Kenya Federation presidential elections. In what amounts to the latest round of squabbling between the two officials, Muhoroni face an uncertain future after FKF on Wednesday slapped them with a suspension and demotion from the National Super League for failing to honour three consecutive league matches in the competition. FKF's decision which now renders some 30 players jobless, comes three months after Muhoroni were relegated from the Kenyan Premier League for finishing last in the 18-team top flight competition last year. Adagala has however scoffed at FKF's action, adding the Muhoroni family has resolved to seek justice in the commercial courts. "This is all political," Adagala, who alleges to own 53 percent of the shares at the club, told Nation Sport. "We requested the federation to postpone our matches in the NSL in anticipation for our appeal to the High Court ruling. They refused." Adagala also claims his club lost an estimated Sh24 million from potential sponsors whom he did not name, after the side was again briefly relegated from the KPL in 2017 for failing to meet the club licensing rules. The consequent lack of funds he adds resulted in the team's poor performance in the league last season.
