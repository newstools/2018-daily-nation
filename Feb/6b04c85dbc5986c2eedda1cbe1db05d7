Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has filed a notice of appeal against High Court ruling that nullified his election on Tuesday. Mr Awiti and his deputy Hamilton Orata filed the notice at the High Court in Homa Bay on grounds that they are dissatisfied with the court's judgement. Judge Joseph Karanja, in his verdict faulted the electoral agency for failing to conduct a free and fair election. Mr Awiti was ordered to pay Sh2 million in costs to the petitioner, Joseph Magwanga. The electoral commission also suffered litigation costs of Sh4 million. On Tuesday evening, the governor defended himself against claims that he bashed the court for nullifying his election. Mr Awiti distanced himself from a statement circulating on social media platforms indicating that he had blamed his loss today in the court to corruption in the Judiciary. He said that neither he nor the county government had issued any press statement on the court ruling. “We wish to inform the public that Homa Bay County Government and Mr Awiti respect and uphold the rule of law and the Judiciary for that matter,” said the governor.   Election was not free and fair, finds Judge Joseph Karanja.
