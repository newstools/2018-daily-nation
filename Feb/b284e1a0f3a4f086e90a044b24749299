When 22-year-old Baraka Moses Chigogo bought a Sh50 raffle ticket this month, little did he know it would be his path to Sh11 million. That raffle ticket proved the source of a perfect Valentines’ Day gift as the youngster from Kilifi County was named winner of Sh11 million in Lotto’s Power draw conducted on Thursday. Baraka becomes the latest winner of Valentine's Power draw and perhaps the youngest at only 22 through a simple purchase of a Sh50 raffle ticket. Last year, businessman John Mugere and his wife Judy Wanjiru won. Lotto’s 238th draw had the winning numbers set as 11, 38, 24, 31, 42, 25 and bonus number 2. Baraka hinted at donating Sh1million to his aunt who brought him up and saw him through Secondary School from where he graduated more than a year ago. He hopes to use the money to pay for a course in engineering.
