There was drama at the Wajir County Assembly on Wednesday evening after a section of the members engaged in a fight when they failed to agree on the choice of the representative of the County Assembly Service Board. Shueb Bare, Diff Ward Rep, took the mace and ran away with it out of the House while the speaker was reading through the day’s order disrupting the Wednesday evening session. Mr Bare accused the county assembly speaker of attempting to influence the choice of the majority of the members over the position. “I decided to take away the mace because I could not withstand the bullying and bulldozing by the county assembly speaker since he tried to influence the nomination of the representative of the board against the assembly members choice, ”he said. The County Assembly Majority Leader Mohamud Gabane warned the speaker against indulging into party affairs arguing that he had personally chaired an earlier meeting that decided on Mr Shueb as their favourite member for the position. The House sergeant at arms together with the security officers returned the mace to the assembly  but the  session ended unofficially a day after the resumption of the assembly activities. Issa Garore, Tarbaj Ward Rep, who was also contesting for the position claimed he was picked to fill the vacancy in December last year. There has been a cold war between the assembly members and the speaker for the last two months over failure by the assembly leadership to approve their claim for the allowances during a past training in Nairobi which was partly funded by Ahadi Kenya. The MCAs were told to raise their claims later after the training which was against their wish.   MCAs fight after they failed to agree on the choice of the representative of the county assembly service board.
