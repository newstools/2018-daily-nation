Riots erupted in Ahero, Kisumu County as a group of young men clashed with police after a man was shot dead during protests against lawyer Miguna Miguna's detention. The protesters turned violent after one of them, a man, was shot in the neck in what police argued was self-defence. Nyanza Regional Police Boss Leonard Katana said the man was shot in the neck as they responded to rescue stranded truck drivers whose cargo were being looted by the protesters. “One man was shot as our officers went to calm the situation,” Mr Katana said. The police boss said four of the officers who responded to the drivers’ distress call were injured and taken to hospital. The man died at Ahero County Hospital while he was receiving treatment. The hospital’s administrator George Mwita said two more people with serious injuries were brought in, attended to and later transferred to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral Hospital. During the protests, a lorry ferrying Coca-Cola products was burnt. Two lorries, one ferrying beer and the other bread were looted during the chaos. Earlier, passengers traveling from Kisumu to Kericho were stranded at Awasi as Nasa supporters blocked the road demanding the release of Mr Miguna. More to follow.
