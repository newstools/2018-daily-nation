Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has survived a petition challenging his election in last August General Election. Malindi Resident Judge Weldon Korir said the petitioner, former Cabinet Minister Kazungu Kambi, failed to provide sufficient evidence. The court ordered Mr Kambi to pay Sh4 million in costs. TWO CASES This is the second petition against Mr Kingi to be dismissed by the High Court. Last October, the High Court struck out a petition by a Jubilee Party supporter challenging Mr Kingi's election with Sh750,000 cost. Wednesday’s verdict had been eagerly awaited by Mr Kingi and Mr Kambi’s supporters. Mr Kingi won the seat with a landslide after beating Mr Kambi (Kadu-Asili) and Gideon Mung’aro (Jubilee). Mr Kingi and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho are the key pointmen for the opposition coalition - National Super Alliance. Mr Joho is also facing a petition challenging his election filed by former Senator Hassan Omar. The case is set to be determined tomorrow (Thursday).
