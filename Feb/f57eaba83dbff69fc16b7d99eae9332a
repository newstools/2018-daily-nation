A former Nairobi MCA, who has been accused of plotting the killing of his wife, will remain in custody until three key witnesses, who prosecution has defined as vulnerable testify. The prosecution convinced Kiambu High Court Judge Joel Ngugi that if released, Mr Samwel Ndung’u Njoroge, the former Riruta ward rep, was likely to interfere, threaten or intimidate the witnesses. Mr Ndung’u has been charged that on January 24 at Kiambu Sub-county, he killed Ms Lucy Njambi, 24, who was reported to have been raped and her body doused in acid. Ms Njambi, a mother of a four-year-old boy, died at the Kenyatta National Hospital where she had been referred from Kiambu Level Five Hospital. A Good Samaritan took her to the Kiambu hospital after finding her at Kamiti having been dumped by her attackers. The prosecution, through State Counsel Jane Maari and Ms Njambi’s family lawyer Ndegwa Njiru had objected to Mr Ndung’u’s bond, arguing that if released, he was likely to interfere with witnesses, some of whom they described as vulnerable. Ms Maari said the witnesses related to Ms Njambi, who was buried in Gatundu South about two weeks ago, are already feeling threatened and have even requested that they be put under witness protection. The three will testify on Monday.   The politician did not give details of the abduction and how he escaped unhurt.
