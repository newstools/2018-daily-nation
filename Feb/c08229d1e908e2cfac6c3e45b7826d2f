An Eldoret businessman accused of issuing death threats to Jubilee party Secretary Raphael Tuju has been released on bond by a Nakuru court. Richard Aketch had been in custody since Tuesday after he first appeared in court over charges of sending Mr Tuju a threatening message after a bitter exchange. Senior Principal Magistrate Liz Gichiha on Friday freed Mr Aketch on a Sh100,000 bond and a surety of the same amount. The 48-year-old is accused of committing the offence on February 2 in Kisumu town. He denied the charges. The court had on February 6 allowed police to continue holding him at the Nakuru Central Police Station until they conclude their investigations. On Friday, the prosecution confirmed before the court that that the investigations were complete. A according to his lawyer Imbwaga Yogo, Mr Aketch was arrested at his business premises in Eldoret by a team of flying squad officers, booked at the Eldoret Police Station before he was transferred to Nakuru. The court heard that the accused had engaged in a bitter exchange with Mr Tuju over the current political affairs in the country before he sent him the text. Mr Imbwanga pleaded with the court to release his client on bond saying that he was not a flight risk. “His arrest and detainment has caused him and his family serious psychological torture and a lot of anguish,” Mr Imbwanga said. Mr Imbwanga claimed the police had subjected Mr Aketch to torture while in the cells. Nakuru County Director Criminal Investigations Directorate Jeremiah Kikuyu Musyoki who was summoned to explain the allegations denied the claims saying that the suspect had been properly fed by the officers. Mr Musyoki further said the suspect had not recorded a complaint against the police station over the allegations.
