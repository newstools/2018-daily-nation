Kenya's newest multi-millionaire was on Wednesday unveiled by SportPesa in Nairobi, a day after the giant gaming firm announced a winner of the mind-blowing Sh230 million Mega Jackpot prize had been found. Gordon Ogada Paul's Sh230,742,881 prize eclipses the amount won by another Kenyan Samuel Abisai courtesy of SportPesa last November by Sh9 million. The Kibera resident landed this amount after correctly predicting the outcome of 17 football matches over the weekend. This includes Sunday's thrilling two-all draw pitting Liverpool against Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. "Life has not been easy since my parents died 20 years ago. I'm very grateful to God for the win and coming through for me," the father of two, who is unemployed, explained. And perhaps in a move to befit his newly found status, Ogada was - alongside his better half and two kids - chauffeured from Kibera to Carnivore in a convoy of sleek vehicles led by a dozen motorcycles (fondly referred to as boda boda) as business at the usual busy Langata highway came to a standstill. "God has answered our prayers. One of us is now very rich, I am sure he will help us to improve our lives," one of the motorbike riders, who identified himself as Oduori, explained. "Our mega jackpot offering is about much more than playing and winning. It represents our will to change people's lives and shows commitment to our local customers who have been a pillar of support to our business," SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri added. Ogada has also encouraged football lovers, and especially his peers, to try their luck in betting.   Samuel Abisai won the first mega jackpot in April last year.
