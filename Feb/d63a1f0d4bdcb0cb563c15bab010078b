The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has deregistered five teachers in Kisii, among them two union officials. The affected union officials had been recruited by the Kisii County Government. DEREGISTERED Mr John Makori, a former Knut chairman, was appointed liquor licensing executive and Mr Geoffrey Mogire, former Kisii South Knut chairman, was named chief administrator in the regional government. Two teachers – Evans Manyara and Jared Omari Agora – also had their names erased after moving on to teach at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Kisii universities, respectively. Also sacked was Geoffrey James, a primary school teacher at Randani COG, who was hired in the Kisii town administration offices. REPLACEMENTS Kisii County TSC Director Nimrod Kimathi said the teachers have been given letters of discharge. “The teachers have now ceased to be employees of TSC because they have since been employed elsewhere,” he said. Mr Kimathi said recent changes in the rules do not allow teachers back in class after they have been recruited to serve elsewhere. “The affected teachers will be replaced by the commission to avoid a vacuum in the institutions,” he added.
