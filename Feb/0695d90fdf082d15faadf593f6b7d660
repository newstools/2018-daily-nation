Three people died while more than 150 have been treated after consuming uninspected meat at Kanuni in Igembe South. Six people were admitted and still undergoing treatment at the Nyambene Sub-County Hospital, Meru County. MEAT Nyambene Medical Superintendent Dr Michael Kariuki said the uninspected meat was sold for a span of four days from February 14. “Two people fell sick and died on Friday and Saturday last week. Another patient died while receiving treatment. More than 150 have been treated and discharged at various health facilities. Currently the situation is under control,” Dr Kariuki said. He said public health officers were in the village to ensure everyone who ate the meat was treated. CAUTION Meru County Public Health director Ephantus Kariuki said the owner of the dead cow had been directed to bury the carcass but he slaughtered it at night. “The veterinary officer who inspected the carcass warned against its consumption. He [the owner] also ignored directives from the area chief. Some residents were being given the meat on credit after it was slaughtered at night,” Mr Kariuki said. He said the suspect had gone into hiding and police officers were pursuing him. “After people fell sick, the seller of the uninspected meat went into hiding. We advise residents against consuming meat from unknown sources,” he said. Meru County Livestock Chief Officer David Mugambi said two cows had died in the area and they suspect they had anthrax. Dr Mugambi said samples were being tested to establish the cause of death.
