Posta Rangers coach Sammy ‘Pamzo’ Omollo has warned his opponents to prepare for a bruising battle in the Kenyan Premier League this season. Rangers have signed up 11 players, among them experienced midfielder Peter ‘Pinchez’ Opiyo from Qatari side Al Markhiya, Suleiman Ngotho (Thika United), Jeremiah Wanjala (Kakamega Homeboyz) and Tusker’s Luis Tera and Danson Kago. Kago’s equaliser secured Rangers a point against 13-time champions AFC Leopards in the opening league fixture on Saturday in Nakuru County. “We’ve brought in very good players, giving me a good challenge as a coach in terms of squad selection. Now we’ve two to three players in every position so whoever impresses in training will play,” Omollo told Nation Sport after Tuesday’s training session at Jamhuri Showground in Nairobi. “From the way we played against Leopards, we are much stronger than last season. The only task is that we’ve to really work extra hard and finish in a better position. As a coach, I already have my best 18 which is very important for match planning.” STIFF COMPETITION The former Kenyan international however expects stiff competition from champions Gor Mahia, Leopards and Sofapaka. “A big challenge will come from Gor Mahia, Sofapaka and the likes of Kariobangi Sharks who showed improvement last season. We will strive to better last season’s achievement,” the coach, who will be without midfielder Kago this weekend against Tusker at Ruaraka grounds, said. “Kago sustained an injury so we don’t expect him on Sunday but Peter (Opiyo) is available and I expect us to be powerful in the midfield department, unlike in the previous game,” Omollo, who led Posta to fourth place finish last season, said.
