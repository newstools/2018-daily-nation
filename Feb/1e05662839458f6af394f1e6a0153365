Hi Brenda, I have been dating a girl for six months now but the problem is that she always waits for me to sleep then takes my phone to snoop. She checks everything. She checks messages from my colleagues, siblings, female friends and even my MPESA messages. She gets angry and suspicious when she bumps into messages from female friends and often threatens to leave me. She’s broken my phone once in a fit of rage. She makes cheating accusations about almost each and every girl I know and this makes our relationship really sour. What can I do?  Your relationship is definitely sour. This girl sounds insecure. Is there a reason that she suspects you, or is she just being paranoid? What was her last relationship like? Perhaps she is carrying baggage from her last liaison into yours. Talk to her and tell her that you do not see this relationship lasting any longer because you are tired of the unfounded accusations. The problem here is trust. If she does not trust you, there is no point. If you do manage to reconcile, make her understand that you are not a case and she is not a detective. We don't go into relationships to be investigated, we go into relationships to love and be loved.     I’m a 29-year-old staunch Christian who has practiced abstinence all my life.
