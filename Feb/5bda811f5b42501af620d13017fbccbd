One person died on the spot Saturday evening while eight others were injured when a matatu they were traveling in rolled into a ditch along the Karatina–Nyeri highway after the driver lost control. Two passengers were seriously injured and admitted to the Tumutumu Hospital while the rest were rushed to different hospitals. Eyewitness said the Matatu belonging to Nyesuma Sacco was heading towards Nyeri from Karatina Town. The driver who could not be immediately identified but known to his colleagues only as “Waria” was reportedly overtaking when he swerved to avoid a head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle before hitting a culvert. He died on the spot. Mathira West OCPD Kiptoo Birgen confirmed the incident, adding that some three other passengers were rushed to a hospital in Nyeri with injuries. “The driver was trying to overtake a Probox vehicle but on realising there was an oncoming vehicle, he swerved to the right side, lost control and landed in a ditch,” he said.
