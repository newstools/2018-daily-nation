Labour Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattaniâ€™s baptism of fire is coming soon. Just a few days in office, an encounter with the officials of the Kenya Universities Staff Union and the Universities Academic Staff Union, which have both issued seven-day strike notices, looms. And, very soon, operations on the campuses of all the public universities could grind to a halt. The two unions have decided to call out their members, accusing the government of not giving counter-proposals for the negotiations of their 2017-2021 collective bargaining agreements. Last year, learning was paralysed in the institutions at least three times over the implementation of the salary awards. The universities and the government had cited lack of funds but later somehow found the money to pay up. The disruption of academic programmes undermines the quality of learning. It is, however, encouraging to hear from Mr Yattani that the government will re-examine its handling of industrial disputes in the public sector. Its poor approach has led to near-perennial crises in the health and education sectors. The CS is also acknowledging the lack of a sustainable and fair labour policy and rationalisation of salaries. But as has been quite evident, needless grandstanding by government officers is also to blame for the acrimonious relations with the unions.
