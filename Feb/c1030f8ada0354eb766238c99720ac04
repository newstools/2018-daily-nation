Dear Brenda, I’m a final year university student going through a rough time. I’ve lost hope in everything to the point of indulging in drugs. I’ve tried applying several jobs to cater for my expenses but none seems to go through. I feel alone and lonely and it’s tearing me apart. Sometimes I get suicidal thoughts and even doubt my sanity.  Hi, I'm sorry you are going through a rough time. I understand that sometimes drugs seem to be the only escape from a difficult life. Do you feel sad because you can't get a job, or is there something else going on? Why are you mostly alone? Sometimes, this can contribute to the feelings of despondency. You need someone to talk to, even if it is just one friend to vent to. You have taken an important first step in acknowledging the problem. Now you also need to get professional help to steer your life back on track. Have you tried talking to your family, or perhaps looking into free therapy options? Most public hospitals offer free help for those who cannot afford the expenses of therapy. They have a desk in the hospital where you can apply for that kind of aid. I wish you the best. Remember, as long as you are alive, there is still hope. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
