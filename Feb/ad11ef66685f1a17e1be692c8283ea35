High Court judge George Odunga is one of the high profile judges affected in the transfers made by Chief Justice David Maraga on Tuesday. Justice Odunga, who has been serving at the Judicial Review Division in Nairobi, has been moved to Machakos High Court as the presiding judge, swapping places with Justice Pauline Nyamweya. Justice Odunga has come under fierce attack especially from politicians aligned to Jubilee because of his decisions. Among the decisions that rattled many is his judgment that found that county returning officers and their deputies were illegally appointed. The decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal, by a bench that was empaneled late in the evening. Mr Maraga moved 14 others judges in the reshuffle. Others include the Principal Judge of the High Court Justice Richard Mwongo, who has been moved to the Naivasha station, Justice Christine Meoli, who moves from Naivasha to Kiambu and Justice Joel Ngugi who has been moved from Kiambu to Nakuru as the presiding judge. Others judges are Maureen Odero from Nakuru to Nairobi (civil division), Justice Lydia Achode- Family Division in Nairobi to Eldoret High Court while the presiding judge in Eldoret, George Kimondo moves to Kisii. Justice Jacqueline Kamau moves back to Nairobi from the High Court in Voi, while Justice Wilfrida Onkwanyi moves from Kisii to the Constitutional and Human Rights division in Nairobi. Justice Rose Ougo also moves from the Family division in Nairobi to Kisii High Court, while Justice Roselyn Aburili moves from the Judicial Review in Nairobi to Bungoma as the presiding judge. Judge Boaz Olao of the Environment and Land Court in Kerugoya swaps places with Justice Samuel Mukunya who has been serving in Bungoma. Justice Joseph Karanja will now preside the High Court in Homabay while Justice Abida Ali Aroni moves from Bungoma to Family division in Nairobi. The judges will report to their new stations in April.
