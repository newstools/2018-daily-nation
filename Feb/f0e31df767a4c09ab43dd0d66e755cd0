Kenyan cricket is in limbo following last week’s resignation of top officials led by Cricket Kenya (CK) president Jackie Janmohammed. CK director of development Abhinert Raja Sarkar, national cricket team coach Thomas Odoyo and team captain Rakeb Patel, also quit. The resignations came in the wake of the national team’s poor show at the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two in Namibia, where they lost all the five matches to not only be relegated to Division Three, but also miss out on the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. This is enough to send a strong message that all is not well. Shockingly, life still seems normal at CK. The sport needs fresh direction with credible people taking office. PAST GLORY We hope that new Sports Cabinet Secretary Mohammed Echesa will intervene as cricket has had enough problems, with bad management topping the list. The sport and administration have sunk too low for a country that not only reached the 2003 World Cup semi-final, but was also a strong candidate for Test status. The silver lining on the dark cloud, however, is that the Kenyan team was 15th out of 16 teams at last month’s 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. The team’s qualification for the World Cup is an indication that all is not lost and Kenya can still regain its past glory in cricket.
