Catholic faithful have started a five-week campaign to promote peace, national integration and reconciliation in the country. Speaking at the Holy Ghost Cathedral during start of this year’s Lenten period, Mombasa Catholic Archbishop Martin Kivuva said the 40 days campaign will also focus on good governance, youth, development, security and child protection. “We all know that last year ended with [a lot of] political heat. Our campaign aims at creating awareness on different ways to establish reconciliation and hold peaceful dialogue among Kenyans and all political leaders,” said Archbishop Kivuva. The archbishop said all Kenyans should preach peace and respect each other’s rights for a peaceful country. MAINTAIN PEACE “Peace and respect for human rights co-exist. I am asking every Kenyan to maintain peace to ensure development in the country,” he said. He also urged Kenyans to avoid divisions along tribal and political lines. “We should identify ourselves as Kenyans not from a tribal or political affiliation. This will promote peace,” he said. Archbishop Kivuva said Pope Francis has asked all Christians to join hands and pray for peace in all war torn countries. Wednesday being a Valentine’s Day, he said, all Kenyans should express love and help the less fortunate. “I [urge] each and every one to read John 3:16 in the Bible and embrace the love of Christ,” he said
