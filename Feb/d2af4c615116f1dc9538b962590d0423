Detectives are piecing together details of the death of a kindergarten pupil who was found dead in a vehicle belonging to a bishop. Emmanuel Wasike, a pupil at Amart Academy, was found Monday morning on the back seat of the abandoned vehicle at Ushindi Baptist Church in Likoni, Mombasa. The vehicle was parked at the compound of the church which is led by Bishop Joseph Maisha. A driver at the church had gone to replace the carâ€™s battery when he saw the body of the six-year-old boy, according to a top church official. The boy had on Sunday been reported missing by his mother. Police who visited the scene said the child is suspected to have locked himself inside the vehicle and suffocated.
