Schools in Marsabit County which have been listed by the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) for allegedly being involved in radicalisation have denied the accusations. Jamia Secondary School Director Ali Sharif dismissed the allegations as unfounded saying the school has never been involved in radicalisation. “Our school offers an equal opportunity to all pupils despite their religion. The news has destroyed the school’s good record,” said Mr Sharif adding that 80 percent of teachers in the school are Christians. “We are ready to allow investigations by the local and national security stakeholders so we can clear the name of the school,” said Mr Sharif. SHOCKING Sasura Girls headteacher Euphemia Thairu told Daily Nation by phone that the news was shocking. “The news was shocking and we want the security teams to explain to us where they got that piece of information from,” said Mrs Thairu. Marsabit Boys head Diid Wario termed the accusation against the school as propaganda. “There is not even one student who has dropped out of the school to join Al-Shabaab as the report claims,” said Mr Wario. Taqwa Integrated, Sakuu Primary and Little Angels Academy headteachers also denied the accusations against their schools. Moi Girls headteacher Halima Adan said the report on alleged radicalisation was released by some parents and not police. “Some of our parents and other locals raised concerns about their fears about some of the sheikhs they think are promoting radicalisation in the school,” said Ms Adan. “We are not in any way involved in radicalisation and we have convened a meeting to address the issue so as to return calm amongst our students and parents,” said Ms Adan.
