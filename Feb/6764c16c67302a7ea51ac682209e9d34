The national population census will be held in August 2019, outgoing Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has said. Mr Kiunjuri added that preparations for the census, which is normally conducted after every 10 years, were ongoing. The minister made the remarks in his office when he handed over the Planning docket to Treasury CS Henry Rotich and Devolution to Mr Eugene Wamalwa. He said since the devolved governments came into force, close to Sh1 trillion had been disbursed to counties. The CS said Sh210 billion was given to county governments in the 2013/14 financial year, Sh226 billion in 2014/15, Sh287 billion in 2015/16, Sh302 billion in 2016/17 and Sh327 billion in 2017/2018. “The Ministry deployed human resource teams and seconded employees from the national government to counties in order to smoothen transition and establish devolved governments,” he said. Mr Rotich welcomed the merging of National Treasury and Planning, saying it would make work easy. Mr Wamalwa said the government would support the drafting of a law on appointment of deputy governors. Mr Kiunjuri will be the Agriculture CS during President Uhuru Kenyatta’s second term.
