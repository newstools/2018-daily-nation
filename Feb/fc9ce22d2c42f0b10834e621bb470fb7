High Court judge Luka Kimaru on Monday ordered police to take lawyer Miguna Miguna to court at 2pm. The judge also summoned the Inspector-General of Police and Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss to show cause why they should not be cited for contempt for failing to comply with orders issued last Friday that directed them to release Mr Miguna. Mr Miguna was arrested last Friday, and on the same day High Court Judge James Wakiaga granted Mr Miguna Sh50,000 bond. But he was not released. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations last Friday said Mr Miguna was arrested after he confessed to administering Nasa leader Raila Odinga’s ‘oath’ and for being a member of an illegal organisation – the National Resistance Movement (NRM).   Police at the station deny Miguna Miguna was in their custody.
