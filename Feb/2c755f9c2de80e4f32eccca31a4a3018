Twelve Nasa leaders have presented themselves to the police as ordered by the High Court. Detectives at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, where they appeared at 11 am Thursday, declined to record their statements because "they are not persons of interest”. Lawyer John Khaminwa who accompanied them said they intended to see the directorate’s boss George Kinoti but he was not in office. He added that they were attended to by a legal officer. Among leaders at the DCI were Siaya senator James Orengo, businessman Jimi Wanjigi, Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati and Mr George Khaniri. "Court orders must be respected and that is why we are here. “Even if police said they don't want to see us now we had to follow directions of the court," said Dr Khaminwa.
