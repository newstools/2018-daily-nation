“Shocking” is how residents of Kiambu Town Sub-County have described the activities of a mysterious gangster who they claim has been raiding homes at night, and even raping women. The lone ranger, who residents have nicknamed mutheca itu (ogre) due to his appearance, has so far been spotted in Ndumberi, Kangoya, Karamba-ini, Riabai, Buriria and Kiawanganyu villages, and is said to be targeting homesteads with wooden doors. Those who have fallen victim, but wished not to be named, have described him as a tall person, often donning a pair of shorts and always carries a sword, a torch and a walking stick. The criminal is also said to wear a long oversize coat. He does not wear shoes but, interestingly, he puts on socks. Victims claim he raids his targets between 2 am and 4 am and breaks doors using a huge stone. A victim said: “He broke the main door using a stone and landed in my bedroom where he demanded that I give him all the money that I had.”
