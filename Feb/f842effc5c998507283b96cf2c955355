Film lovers flocked to Kisumu on Tuesday night to witness the much anticipated screening of the African Premiere of Black Panther movie. Black Panther is a 2018 American super hero film based on the marvel comics character in 1966’s Fantastic Four comic books. The Disney movie tells the story of T’Challa/Black Panther, the new king of futuristic and wealth laden African nation called Wakanda. A part from Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o, the movie is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B Jordan, Angela Basset, Forest Whittaker and Daniel Kaluuya. ACTORSThe absence of Lupita, who plays a major role in the movie, did not dampen the spirits of the famous people in the local entertainment industry from gracing the occasion. Lupita is the daughter of Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o. The 300-seater Imax Cinema in Kisumu was fully packed for the action-packed 140 minutes film. Mr Moses Oduwa, a Kisumu-based stage and film actor popularly known as Omwami Nyangala, termed the movie premiere a boost for local artists. “I am happy that most of the cast in the movie were Africans. We are accustomed to white people in nearly all the Hollywood movies. I’m happy that the Africa Premier was done in Lupita’s hometown,” Mr Oduwa said. LIVESTREAMING Kisumu Deputy Governor Mathews Owili praised the decision to have the movie premiere in the region. “It is a good opportunity for us as Kisumu residents. It shows the many opportunities the region can offer for not only arts but other investments,” Dr Owili said. Besides film lovers and makers, local and international journalists were present to document the event. The red carpet arrivals live stream started around 6pm, on the ‘One Vibe Africa’ and ‘What’s Good Studios’ Facebook pages. This was followed by a cocktail at Kisumu’s Mega City, which preceded the 7.30pm movie showing. Liquid Telecom in collaboration with the county government lay a 3km Internet link to enable livestreaming of the event.
