An accident involving a school bus in which one student was killed and nearly 20 others injured on the Kisumu-Bondo road on Saturday is yet another reminder about the need to enhance safety in school transport. With many students travelling frequently to participate in co-curricular activities such as sports, drama and music festivals, their safety is paramount. It’s perhaps too early to determine what could have gone wrong, but this account in itself raises queries on the driver’s judgment just before the collision. Could he have been speeding? Or was the other driver to blame? We leave that to the traffic police to establish and take appropriate action. INCOMPETENT DRIVERS However, human error and the condition of vehicles have been key factors in school bus accidents. Incompetent drivers hired through opaque processes have contributed to the rising cases of school bus accidents. A key factor is lack of or poor maintenance. There has been a proliferation in the number of school buses on our roads, as it is prestigious for every institution to own one. But many of the buses are poorly maintained. ROADWORTHINESS While we laud the authorities for striving to streamline school transportation, it’s important that this is enforced beyond merely requiring the vehicles to be repainted yellow. This colour enhances visibility of the vehicles and eases the identification of school transport, but more needs to be done to enhance safety. Random checks to confirm the competence of drivers and the roadworthiness of the vehicles are a must.
