The government has offered financial guarantees that will enable Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards honour their continental assignments in Equatorial Guinea and Madagascar respectively next weekend. Senior officials of these two teams on Friday confirmed the Ministry of Sports, which has remained tight-lipped on this matter, has undertaken to purchase air-tickets for the two clubs. "I commend the government for this assistance. The onus now is on our players and technical bench to work hard and ensure we qualify for the next phase of this tournament," said Leopards treasurer Oliver Napali. "I have been asked to forward the names of our travelling party and we expect to have the tickets by end of business today," added K'Ogalo's chief executive officer Lordvick Aduda. The two clubs have however been tasked with catering for accommodation and transport upon arrival. This development comes a day after these two officials told Nation Sport they were unable to marshal enough resources to send their clubs for the respective engagements. LEAD 2-0 Gor Mahia hold a dicey 2-0 advantage over Vegetarinos which was attained in Machakos last weekend, ahead of the Caf Champions League preliminary round return leg clash between the two teams in Malabo on Wednesday. Leopards meanwhile are in a trickier position, having allowed FOSA Juniors to score an away goal and snatch a one-all draw in the opening match of the Caf Confederation Cup preliminaries in Kakamega last Sunday. Following the government's intervention, Leopards advance party consisting three officials who are on a spying mission will fly out to Mahajanga in Madagascar on Saturday. The remaining travelling party consisting 19 players, plus seven members of the technical bench led by coach Robert Matano, and three club officials including chairman Dan Mule who is the head of delegation, leave on Monday.   “Our remaining option is to pull out.”
