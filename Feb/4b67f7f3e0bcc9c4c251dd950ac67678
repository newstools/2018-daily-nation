Caroline Mutoko once claimed that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 takes 24 megapixel photos because it has two cameras each of 12 megapixels in a video that went viral, making her a subject of mockery in social media spheres. While she may have got it wrong in grasping the idea of a camera phone with two main cameras, the truth is that with the digital revolution, cameras are becoming a more essential feature for smartphone users and are a great selling point for phone manufacturers. However, it can be difficult to tell what to go for when looking for a good camera phone and this article breaks it down for you. First things first, let’s breakdown some terminologies you'd normally find on a manufacturers product information sheet and explain their relevance in informing your choice. IMAGE QUALITY The term megapixels (million pixels) is very common and many people make their smartphone choices mainly because of this. It refers to the number pixels, of an image the camera can capture by the million. So, the higher the MP, the better right? No! Megapixel count can only be relevant if the image sensor is big enough to handle it. Micrometre, or µm pixel is a term used to describe the size of an individual pixel in a camera. Many of these make up the image sensor, the piece of hardware responsible for turning light into images. The larger the µm pixel, the better the image quality. This is why a 12MP camera with a larger sensor easily outperform a 16MP one with a smaller sensor. Therefore, the whole narrative of ‘more megapixel = better image quality’ should be the absolute last thing that informs your decision since it isn’t an accurate reflection of a camera’s final image quality. APERTURE Camera aperture is another thing worth considering. It implies to the size of the hole that allows light into the camera sensor. Most, if not all smartphone cameras are all fixed aperture lenses and generally, the bigger it is the better since the camera gets more light. Smartphone aperture in normally indicated as f1.6, f1.7, f1.8 etc. and what is worth noting is that a bigger aperture is always indicated with a smaller number. For instance an f1.6 aperture is bigger than an f2.2. DUAL CAMERAS What about dual camera phones? Well, this is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand we have honest manufacturers who make genuine dual cameras matching the intended functionalities of a dual camera, while on the other hand some phones are just deceptively advertised as dual cameras. The best advice would be to visit local smartphone stores and check them out whether they fit your expectation when it comes to dual camera phones, as well as single ones. You can also read reviews about the device to get a better perspective. Choosing from established brands like Samsung, iPhone and Huawei  is also a safe bet on dual cameras. However, if established brands prove costly, consider all the options within your price range and go for the one with a camera sensor from established manufacturers like Sony and Samsung cameras. Budget smartphones often choose to install cameras from such established brands, lowering production costs while giving you a better shooter on a budget. PROCESSOR The phones processor is nothing you want to skimp on on either. Part of what makes a good camera is a good processor capable of processing images fast. Keep storage in mind too, the larger it is the more images and videos you can store in your phone. Lastly, always ensure that your phone’s firmware is always up to date. Manufacturers often provide firmware updates to fix an array of bugs and issues affecting your phone and you camera stands to benefit, so don’t ignore that ‘update available’ notification.
