A number of Coast ward representatives who failed to defend their seats are yet clear loans taken from the government. In Mombasa, about 15 MCAs have not cleared imprests amounting to Sh5 million. “We have sent letters to those who have not cleared to do so as they have blocked the clearance of gratuity of those who were not re-elected,” Assembly clerk Salim Juma said. In Lamu, all the 20 MCAs who served in the previous assembly have returned the gadgets they received from the government. In Kwale County, MCAs paid their car and mortgage loans two months before the election. “We did not experience any challenges in recovering the money,” Kwale Speaker Sammy Ruwa said. LOANSMinority Leader Ndoro Mweruphe said he serviced his Sh3.5 million loan in time. Kilifi Assembly clerk Jefwa Mkare said the Speaker Jimmy Kahindi and 51 MCAs took loans from Family Bank. “Most applied for about Sh1.5 million. No money was lost,” he said. Mr Mkare said out of the 104 laptops procured by the assembly, 54 were issued to the ward representatives. MORTGAGE In Tana River, Sh110 million still lies in the car and mortgage account as MCAs refused to take the loans, citing strict rules and religious constraints. Majority Leader Salah Adamo said the loans fell out of favour with Muslim MCAs because they attracted interest. Because of that, the Car and Mortgage Bill was passed in 2015. To get mortgage, one is required to have a title deed, yet most of the land in the county is community. Mr Adamo however said things may be different in the current House as some new members had shown interest in getting the loans.
