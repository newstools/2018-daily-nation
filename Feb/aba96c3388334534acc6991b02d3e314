The electoral agency is prepared to conduct by-elections for various elective positions that have been nullified by courts, it has said. Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Wafula Chebukati said the commission had set aside funds to cater for by-elections. “The commission is ready for by-elections since it is something we anticipated and budgeted for,” Mr Chebukati said. MINI POLLS Out of the more than 300 election petitions filed in court, at least five of them have been nullified paving way for mini polls. The election of Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama of Maendeleo Chap Chap was nullified on Wednesday. Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi’s election was also nullified last month but he appealed the judgement. While Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti also vowed to appeal cancellation of his election. While speaking to journalists in Mombasa, Mr Chebukati said according to the records available at the commission, many of the poll petitions filed after the August 8 General Elections have been thrown out with only a small percentage sailing through. Some cases are still pending in High Court and the Court of Appeal. LSK ELECTIONS Mr Chebukati was speaking at the Mombasa Law Courts after voting in the ongoing Law Society Kenya elections. He assured members of the bar a free, fair, verifiable and transparent elections. He said that having been approved by the LSK to conduct elections on its behalf, the commission has improved its voting systems to ensure that no rigging takes place during voting and counting of the ballots. “This time round the commission has moved a notch higher, the system we are using is an inbuilt system specifically for the LSK, which is foolproof in the sense that one cannot vote twice,” he said He said the commission is committed to delivering credible polls to boost the confidence of Kenyans in the electoral body.
