Two State departments are embroiled in a tussle to control Sh470 million for provision of sanitary towels to learners in hardship areas. The State department of Basic Education, which has over the years been in charge of the funds, last year lost the control to the State department of Gender Affairs in the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs. READ: Concerns as sanitary pads project moved from ministry Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang' told National Assembly’s Education committee that the relocation of the funds had affected provision of sanitary towels to pupils in primary schools. “We as a ministry are well placed to deliver the sanitary towels to the pupils since we interact with them and not the Gender department,” Dr Kipsang said.

The PS appealed to the committee led by Tinderet MP Julius Melly to help revert the funds to the Ministry of Education. The MPs concurred with his proposal promising to take up the matter with the Budget and Appropriation committee of the National Assembly. Last year in June, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a Bill into law, which compels the government to provide a safe and environmentally sound mechanism for disposal of the sanitary towels. The Basic Education Amendment Act places the responsibility of providing free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels on the government in order to reduce the number of girls missing school during their periods.
