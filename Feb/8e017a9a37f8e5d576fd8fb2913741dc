The High Court has summoned the Inspector-General of police Joseph Boinnet and the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti to explain failure to release of lawyer Miguna Miguna. Justice Luka Kimaru ruled that the police have acted unlawfully and ordered the two bosses to appear in person tomorrow at 9am, and bring along Mr Miguna. The judge said if the two do not want to appear in court they should have Mr Miguna released before end of Monday. A State lawyer told the court that orders issued were effectively served to the DCI, IG and the AG and that the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is keen to see the matter resolved. Mr Miguna was arrested last Friday, and on the same day High Court Judge James Wakiaga granted him Sh50,000 bond. But he was not released. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations last Friday said Mr Miguna was arrested after he confessed to administering Nasa leader Raila Odinga’s ‘oath’ and for being a member of an illegal organisation – the National Resistance Movement (NRM). At least 10 Nasa lawyers represented Mr Miguna who was not brought before Justice Kimaru as ordered by the High Court on Monday morning.   The lawyers asked court to hold the IG and DCI liable for disobeying the court order. Nasa leader Raila Odinga and business man Jimi Wanjigi were present during the court session.   Court summons IG and DCI boss for failing to release the lawyer.
