Pretoria South African President Jacob Zuma has refused to resign, saying he will only step down if the ruling African National Congress (ANC) top brass explains to him what he has done wrong. In an exclusive interview with SABC TV on Wednesday at his official residence in Pretoria‚ Mahlamba Ndlopfu‚ President Zuma said the national executive committee’s decision to recall him was irrational as he had done no wrong. “I indicated to the top six that what they have raised is not the first time. They have raised it in the NEC itself twice and nobody has ever been able to tell me what the issue is. The NEC themselves said that I must resign‚ and I find that very strange that I should do so because this is not the first time that they've said this‚” President Zuma said. PROCESS He said there were processes in the ANC that need to be followed if a deployee has done wrong. “In the discussion‚ I asked…what was the problem? Why must I be persuaded to resign? Have I done anything wrong?" he said. He said he would only resign if the top six could furnish him with reasons why he should‚ explaining what he had done wrong. "At the discussion in the NEC nobody was able to tell me what I've done. There's no policy in the ANC and there's nothing that once there is a new president of the ANC‚ there must be changes‚" he said. NO CONFIDENCE MOTION Meanwhile, the National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has sent a letter to Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema informing him that she has decided to reschedule the motion of no confidence in President Zuma for Thursday 15 February at 2pm. Ms Mbete said her decision was made after consultation with the leader of government business and the chief whip of the ANC. The ANC announced earlier on Wednesday that its MPs will vote with opposition parties in a motion of no confidence against President Zuma at Parliament on Thursday.   Zuma says he has been given no reason by the party why he should resign.
