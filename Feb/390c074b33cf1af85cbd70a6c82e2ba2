Mr Kajwang — who was to be the oath administrator, although Mr Odinga ended up reading it directly from a paper — was arrested by plainclothes police officers at the Milimani Law Courts and driven to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters moments after he joked about his new title — “Chief Justice” Kajwang’ — which he said he earned during the ceremony.
