The Kisumu County government has launched a Sh99 million garbage relocation project despite a pending court case on the matter. On Monday, the National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) sanctioned the relocation of Kachok dumpsite, giving it a certificate of compliance. Kisumu City Manager Doris Ombara said the relocation will take two-and-a-half months. According to Environment Executive Salmon Orimba, about 100 hydraulic trucks will transport the waste every day. However, four petitioners are seeking a court injunction to stop the relocation of the dumpsite to a quarry pit in Kajulu pending the hearing and determination of the case on February 19. They have accused the county of awarding the tender without carrying out an environmental impact assessment which is mandatory. But Deputy Governor Mathews Owili and Senator Fred Outa have maintained that proper procedures were followed to acquire the quarry and that there was public participation.   Investors say building houses on plots next to dumpsite is impossible.
