Tea producers want the Agriculture ministry to reconstitute the Tea Board of Kenya and appoint directors of boards of various parastatals in its docket. Kenya Tea Growers Association (KTGA) chief executive Apollo Kiarii said the boards will give direction to the sector and subsectors, noting that failure to do so could put in jeopardy developments so far made in the tea sector including research on diseases. Mr Kiarii said the Tea Research Institute, for example, should be able to carry our research regularly to avoid possibility of diseases in the years to come. However, he noted, the institute does not yet have a board of directors to guide it. “We need to see boards of directors appointed to the various bodies under the Ministry and the Agriculture Food Authority (AFA), including the reinstatement of the Tea Board of Kenya, to ensure direction for the development of the tea sector,” said Mr Kiarii.

We need to see it reconstituted,” said Mr Kiarii. AFA director-general Alfred Busolo said that while many boards – including that of AFA – were not yet in place, it was an issue that was in the hands of the Ministry of Agriculture. “The issue of boards is for the ministry to decide on, so we can’t comment on it,” said Mr Busolo on phone.
