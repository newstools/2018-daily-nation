Insurance broker Minet Kenya has embarked on a nationwide campaign to market its services after rebranding. The broker, formally trading as Aon Kenya, on Friday met its clients at the Coast to mark the completion of the acquisition by Capitalworks of AON PLC shareholding in AON Kenya. Speaking at a meeting with clients in Mombasa, Minet Kenya chief officer Sammy Muthui said the new brand carries the same promises the old one did. “We shall continue to offer the best in class risk, reinsurance and people solutions, with increased innovation and agility,” he said He said the change of ownership would not have any negative impact on the staff. “There will be no redundancy. In fact, we expect to continue attracting the very best talent in the market and beyond in this digital age.” Mr Muthui said the acquisition of Aon Plc shareholding by Capitalworks in the company would unlock significant agility that would enable them respond faster to client needs in providing solutions and in servicing market segments not previously easily accessible.

The Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) approved the conclusion of acquisition proposal, indicating that the purchase would not have a negative effect on competition.
