Newly-appointed Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Achesa takes office at a critical period and has a tough assignment ahead. Sports is struggling due to declining finances worsened by withdrawal of major sponsorship. Many federations, clubs and national teams are operating on shoestring budgets that undermine their capacity to compete effectively at the international level. His predecessor, Hassan Wario, might have succeeded in some areas with the enactment of the 2013 Sports Act, which saw the formation of Sports Disputes Tribunal, Sports Fund, Registrarâ€™s Office and the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (Adak). Right now, however, the country is almost cancelling the 2019 World Table Tennis Championships qualifiers due for March in Nairobi, because of lack of funds. Further, sports is reeling from poor infrastructure. Kenya lost the opportunity to host the Africa Nations Championship (Chan) due to lack of infrastructure. The new minister must clean up the mess.
