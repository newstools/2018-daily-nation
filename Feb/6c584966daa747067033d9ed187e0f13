Two leading media houses lost more than Sh42 million following last month’s shutdown of their businesses by the government, a parliamentary committee has been told. The Information Communication and Innovation Committee, chaired by Marakwet West MP William Kisang, was told on Friday that NTV lost Sh22.8 million while KTN lost Sh22 million. “We have received a letter from Nation Media Group, which indicates that it lost revenue worth Sh22.8 million; it is signed by S. Owino, head of legal affairs,” Mr Kisang said while reading the letter to the committee. He went on: “The letter further says there was no communication from the government on the shutdown.” AUDIENCEStandard Group acting chief executive Orlando Lyomu, who was accompanied by KTN managing director Joe Munene and KTN managing editor Joe Ageyo, told the committee that the station lost Sh22 million. Mr Lyomu said the station also lost audience due to the shutdown. The government shut down the stations on January 30 on subversion allegations by the Interior ministry, following the mock swearing-in of opposition leader Raila Odinga. Their signals were restored on February 5. Mr Ageyo said it was extremely dangerous for the government to determine what people should watch. “We have laws that guide our operations and, therefore, the government should not gag us,” he said. LAWMr Lyomu however did not rule out the station going to court to seek damages, noting that discussions were still going on. He called for more engagement with the Media Council of Kenya. Mr Kisang said the committee would continue to engage all stakeholders to ensure the media work in harmony. “This is our country; we must work as a team,” the chairman said, adding that the committee was willing to help the media put up laws promoting a conducive working environment. Also Citizen TV and Kikuyu-language Inooro TV of Royal Media Services were forced off air.   Both have so far not criticised the move to shut down NTV, KTN News and Citizen TV.
