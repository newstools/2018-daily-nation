Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka now says that he is ready to take an 'oath ' as the ‘people's deputy president’ “any time, even now”. The Nasa co-principal said the coalition is stronger and will remain intact despite intra-coalition wars. "We do not want to issue empty dates and then we do not swear in. The commitment is still there, and how I wish I could be sworn-in even now," Mr Musyoka said. Mr Musyoka said given the accusations and counter accusations in the coalition, Nasa will on Friday meet all its elected leaders to iron out issues post the Raila Odinga 'oath'. "Our opponents are not within Nasa. We are more than ever before committed to the unity of Nasa," he said. The former vice-president reiterated his comments that the no-show by him, Musalia Mudavadi, and Moses Wetang'ula was a strategic move by the team. "We are strong as Nasa. We do not fear. Skipping the event was a plan. We will not retreat," he said. He vowed, " I am not a coward. We are ready to move this country forward. We have all sacrificed for it." Mr Kalonzo was speaking at the party headquarters in Nairobi after he chaired a National Executive Committee meeting Mr Musyoka said he had washed his hands regarding a national dialogue proposed by the international community to heal the ongoing political crisis in the county. He, however added that, such a discussion about electoral justice will happen eventually.
