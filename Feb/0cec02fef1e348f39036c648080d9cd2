Kenyan Premier League giants AFC Leopards on Wednesday bowed out of the Caf Confederation Cup on away goals, after battling to a barren draw with Madagascan side Fosa Juniors in the return leg of their preliminary round tie away. Leopards were undone by the first leg tie at Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega, which ended 1-1 giving Fosa Juniors the vital away goal. Leopards had to settle for a win of any margin, or force a scoring draw to stand a chance of advancing to the next phase of the qualifiers. Precisely, that 16th minute goal scored by FOSA Juniors forward Rado Mbolasoa in Kakamega in Kakamega did all the damage. At the packed Rabemananjara stadium in Mahanja, Madagascar on Wednesday, new signing Ezekiel Odera had the best chance to hand Leopards the lead in the first half but the veteran forward fluffed the goal scoring opportunity by directing his fierce shot just wide off the mark with only the goalkeeper to beat. Defender Dennis Sikhayi too was unable to direct his header off a Michael Kibwage free kick on target as Leopards - who are yet to win a competitive game this season - struggled to find the back of the net. But it could have been worse for the Kenyans as the hosts, who approached the game cautiously, seemed to have been set up to counter attack. In one of the occasions, a neatly worked attack that covered half the length of the pitch ended up with Herisoa Santatra failing to make contact with a cross in the danger area. The result piles pressure on under-fire Leopards coach Robert Matano, considering he was allowed by the management to sign a dozen players with purposes of bolstering the squad specifically for this competition. FOSA Juniors meanwhile will progress to face AS Port Louis in the first round of this competition.
