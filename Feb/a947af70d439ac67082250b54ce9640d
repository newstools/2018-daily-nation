Police have named three men suspected of carrying out the terror attack at a Wajir primary school that claimed three lives. Two non-local teachers were killed Friday morning, alongside the wife of one of them, when gunmen attacked Qarsa Primary School. North Eastern regional coordinator Mohamud Swaleh revealed the names of the suspects as Maalim Yusuf Abdullahi, Daud Ahmed Mohamed and Abdirashid Ibrahim Osman. Mr Swaleh named Mr Abdullahi, who hails from Bojigaras, as the commander of the group that carried out the attack. Mr Abdullahi is married with three children, officials said. Mr Swaleh directed the chiefs in the area to produce the suspects to security officers. The two teachers who died in the attack were identified as Seth Oluoch Odada and Kevin Shari and Mrs Caroline, Oluochâ€™s wife. Their bodies were flown to Nairobi Friday. Suspected Al-Shabaab militants have carried out three attacks in Wajir County since the year began including a botched attack on a special forces camp in Kutulo last week.   The attack comes a week after suspected Shabaab militia tried to raid a special forces camp in Kutulo.
