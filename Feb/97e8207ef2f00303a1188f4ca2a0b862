African Games 400m silver medallist Boniface Mweresa and Maximilla Imali will lead Kenya's quest for glory in the men and women's 400m teams at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games set for April 4-15 in Australia. Mweresa seemed to have saved his energy for the last 50m when shot to the front to win in 46.00 seconds, beating National champion Collins Omae to second place in 46.39. Omae pulled from behind to sneak into to second place, edging out former national champion Alphas Kishoyian to third in 46.42. The trio will represent Kenya at the Gold Coast Games with Mweresa and Kishoyian making their debut at the "Club" Games. STRUGGLED IN GLASGOW Omae competed at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games but failed to make it from the 200m heats. "I will need to go back and polish up in many areas," said Mweresa, who represented Kenya in 400m at the London World Championships where he failed to make the semi-finals. "I had trained to attack the last 200m and it played out well." Imali timed 52.41 to win and qualify for her maiden Commonwealth Games. "I learnt a lot at the London World Championships hence there will be no room for mistakes in Gold Coast," said Imali. Veronica Mutua settled second in 53.64 to also qualify as Evangeline Nthenya came in third in 53.64 to take the last qualifying slot.   Cheng'etich will be missing in action in Gold Coast.
