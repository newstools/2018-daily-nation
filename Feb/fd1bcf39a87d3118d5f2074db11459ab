The national government will soon rollout a gas cylinder programme to facilitate the affordability of the product to a majority of Kenyans. Speaking at the Energy Parliamentary Committee meeting at English Point Marina in Mombasa on Wednesday, Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said the programme would be rolled out in May. Additionally, Petroleum Principal Secretary Andrew Kamau said the government will introduce a 6kg Liquid Petroleum Gas cylinder and put the duty of kerosene on the same level as that of diesel. The PS said one of the hurdles of using gas is the price of the cylinder. “There is an anomaly in this business because you and I can never own the cylinder. "It belongs to the oil company and so we just pay deposits. We decided to buy some and reduce the price of a of 6kg cylinder from Sh4,000 to Sh2,000,” Mr Kamau said, urging lawmakers to pass the Petroleum Bill. The PS said the government had also come up with a plan to enable Kenyans buy cylinders and pay for the gas daily.
