Public universities could face another nationwide nationwide strike, following stalled negotiations between the staff union and the government over a 2017-2021 collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The Kenya Universities Staff Union (Kusu) on Saturday threatened to disrupt services in the higher learning institutions should the Inter Public Universities Council Consultative Forum (IPUCCF) and the State Department of Education continue derailing negotiations. STALLED Led by the Union Secretary-General Charles Mukhwaya, the union said the government was non-committal in concluding negotiations in order to sign and register the CBA in time. Speaking in Nakuru, Dr Mukhwaya said negotiations have stalled because the government has failed to offer a counter proposal on their demands. He accused the government of being unprepared and refusing to participate in the negotiations. “We protest and hate the fact that for the three meetings we have held with the IPUCCF, the government has demonstrated lack of commitment to the process by giving countless excuses so as not to engage us,” said Dr Mukhwaya. The parties had agreed to sit on the negotiating table between January 25 and February 28, to conclude talks over the CBA before its implementation. ULTIMATUM Dr Mukhwaya urged the government to fast track the completion of the negotiations within the remaining time. The union gave the IPUCCF and the government until the end of next week to offer the counter proposal. He warned that they would seek alternative means to resolving the matter if the government does not participate in the talks. “If by the close of business on February 23, the IPUCCF shall not have given a counter proposal for 2017-2021 CBA, the union shall entertain alternative approaches that can help break the inertia and expedite the process,” said Dr Mukhwaya.
