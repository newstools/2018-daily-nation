The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) is collecting data on teachers addicted to alcohol and drugs in Embu in a order to rehabilitate them. TSC Director Janet Onyango said tens of teachers are suffering from the addictions, which are affecting service delivery and the quality of education. Addressing school heads at Kangaru School, the TSC official said many teachers are abdicating duty at the end of the month, only to resume when they have exhausted their salaries. She said the habit has strained relationships between some teachers and their immediate supervisors, and poses a threat to the students they are supposed to take care of. DESERTING DUTY “We got wind of the information and when we made a follow-up, we realised that they are deserting (duty) because once they get their salaries, they go out drinking and many of them never remember to come back until the money is finished. “Many are becoming a real headache, a thorn in the flesh of the principals. Some are even doing drugs and their behaviour is not normal,” she said. Ms Onyango appealed to school heads to forward names of the affected teachers so that they can undergo counselling through the TSC wellness programme. SICK “These teachers are sick; the moment you become addicted, you are sick. Let us talk to them and let them agree to go for rehab. When they are in that state, they are not helping our children,” she said. Though the official did not give any figures, in 2004 TSC had taken six teachers suffering from severe drunkenness to Mathare Hospital for rehabilitation while about 100 others were counselled at the divisional level. Ms Onyango at the same time warned school principals against going out of their places of work for prolonged periods, saying they would face disciplinary action.
