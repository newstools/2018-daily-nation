Veteran politician Koigi wa Wamwere has warned that the country is sliding into dictatorship following the recent political developments. The former Subukia MP, who participated in the second liberation struggle, on Friday condemned the government’s recent crackdown on Opposition leaders and the media which he termed unlawful. He said although Nasa leader Raila Odinga’s 'swearing-in' was unnecessary, the government’s reaction to it was uncalled for. The politician also termed the 'deportation' of lawyer Miguna Miguna unconstitutional.
