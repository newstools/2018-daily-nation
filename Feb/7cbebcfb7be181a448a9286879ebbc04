As Sports and Heritage Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa settles into office and prepares to meet stakeholders, one area he must improve on is his ministry’s support for the so-called ‘fringe’ sports. While Kenya continues to dominate in athletics and rugby, and with football also enjoying massive following, the ‘smaller’ disciplines also need to be encouraged. It’s disappointing that Kenya Table Tennis Association (KTTA) president Andrew Mudibo had to literally camp at the ministry’s Kencom House headquarters to push for the release of funds for next week’s 2019 World Table Tennis Championships qualifier, which Nairobi will host. The championships, scheduled for March 1 to 3 at Kasarani, will feature Africa’s best players. While KTTA had a budget of Sh10 million, the ministry granted the association Sh7.1 million, leaving a shortfall of Sh2.9 million. Granted, the ministry has massive requests for financial assistance, meaning that officials at Kencom House must meticulously plan their budgets to avoid releasing funds to associations late. The new CS should push for equitable and timely distribution of the cake.
