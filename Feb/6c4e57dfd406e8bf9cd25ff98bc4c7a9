South Africa has a new President, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, in yet another interesting change of leadership in Africa that underscores the growing democracy on the continent. Mr Ramaphosa, a veteran politician and one of the leading business figures, was elected on Thursday as the fifth post-apartheid era President. This followed President Jacob Zuma’s resignation. Mr Zuma, who was only recently removed as the leader of the African National Congress, tried to cling on, but the writing was on the wall. Once the ANC chose a new leader, Mr Ramaphosa, it was only a question of time before Mr Zuma exited. His leadership has been characterised by apparent personal flaws that saw increasing public criticism of his performance. But the legacy of the man, who was imprisoned alongside the iconic Nelson Mandela during the struggle for freedom, has been buried in corruption allegations. Mr Ramaphosa now has a chance to redefine and re-establish his country’s leadership of the continent. South Africa is not only an economic power, but also a continental leader. The orderly change of leadership in South Africa, coming soon after Zimbabwean strongman Robert Mugabe was ousted in a peaceful military-inspired leadership change, is good news for a continent yearning for greater democratization. The new leader has what it takes to pull South Africa out of the rut.
