Children in South Sudan have been forced to watch their mothers being raped and killed, the UN says. Civilians have been tortured and mutilated, and villages destroyed on an industrial scale, it said. These are some of the horrific abuses that a team of UN human rights investigators has detailed in a report published about the conflict in South Sudan.

Conflict between government factions has continued in South Sudan despite a peace deal signed in 2015. The report will be presented to the UN human Rights Council in Geneva, but its real purpose is to provide evidence for a proposed hybrid court to try alleged war criminals.
