Will it be fifth time unlucky for Kenya Ports Authority women basketball team? That’s the big question for the ports women as they host Equity Bank in Game Three of the National Classic Basketball League play-off finals in Makande, Mombasa, Saturday. The game brings down the curtain on the 2017 basketball season with KPA’s men’s team in need of a win against Strathmore University’s “Blades” to seal the men’s title. Saturday’s play-off finals — which are sponsored by Enlightened Sports and Events Network — will be historic since it is the first time ever for a decisive National Classic Basketball League final round of matches to be played outside Nairobi. The Kenya Basketball Federation decided that KPA — having teams in the men’s and women’s finals — host the finals following the unavailability of the Nyayo National Stadium which is currently closed for renovations. While KPA’s women host Equity Bank in what will be a repeat of last year’s finals which Equity win the best-of-five finals 3-2, KPA’s men have a date with “Blades” with both KPA teams leading the five-game series 2-0. After comfortably beating Equity by a massive 38 points in Game One last year, KPA relaxed, allowing their opponents to win the series 3-2 denying the dockers the chance to win the trophy they last won in 2013. But KPA coach Anthony Ojukwu, though cautious, this time round believes the trophy is KPA’s to loose if the results of the first two games in Nairobi is anything to go by. “I think we have a better personnel this year with Felmas Adhiambo just unstoppable on the blocks while shooting guard Seline Okumu along with Betty Kananu and Georgia Adhiambo enjoying a form of their lives,” he said. Other players expected to lead KPA include Natalie Akinyi, Annrose Mandela, Brigit Nanzala and Brenda Amgeshi.
