The national food situation is worrying. The impact of last year’s prolonged drought continues to bite, with vast areas staring at food shortages. According to Kenya Red Cross secretary-general Abbas Gullet, 3.4 million Kenyans are facing hunger and starvation. The situation is particularly bad in the arid and semi-arid areas, where people also lost livestock – their main source of livelihood. People, who watched helplessly as their animals dropped dead, now have nothing to eat. As if the elements were conspiring against Kenyans, an armyworm invasion also ravaged crops in the North Rift bread basket, and in parts of the coastal region. We have a crisis on our hands as the next harvest will not be in until later in the year. The Red Cross’s Sh1 billion relief food appeal could not have come at a more appropriate time. The money to be raised will be used for healthcare, water supply, cash transfer, livestock offtake and food distribution. Of course, the society is only complementing the government’s measures. But the situation could get worse as the weatherman says various areas will soon be ravaged by floods. So besides hunger, homes will be swept away by the raging waters and deaths could also occur. Greater efforts must be made, not only to ensure that vulnerable Kenyans have enough food, but also to secure their homes.
