The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) has ordered the immediate closure of Nairobi’s Burma market for what the agency has termed as “high level of violation of the plastic ban”. Nema Corporate Communications Manager Evans Nyabuto Thursday confirmed the closure, adding that the market will remain shut until it can demonstrate full compliance with the plastic bags ban. The environment agency further said that it had consulted with all law enforcement agencies in Nairobi, including the county police commander and his team and county askaris, all who will ensure the shutdown is enforced. Plastic bags were banned in Kenya with effect from August 28, with exceptions given for garbage bin liners and those used for packaging goods in industries. However, plastic bags, especially from neighbouring countries where no such ban exists, have been finding their way to Kenya. Thirty-one people were arrested in Mombasa on Monday for being in possession of plastic bags. A vehicle ferrying the bags without a permit was also impounded. Following the arrests, 29 people were on Tuesday fined Sh50,000 each or serve one year in jail in default after they pleaded guilty. Three others denied the charges and were released on a Sh400,000 bond and a surety of a similar amount after denying the charges.
