His team 0-2 down in the best-of-five play-off finals, he still harbours hopes of silencing the hosts at their Makande court Saturday afternoon. Hilda Indasi, arguably Kenya”s best shooting guard today, will be relied upon to lead Equity who also have Samba Mjomba, Mercy Wanyama and Belinda Akoth to rely on.
