The Nation Media Group has invited the police to investigate how a death notice was placed in the Daily Nation bearing a picture of Nasa supporter and businessman Jimi Wanjigi. The advertisement was published on Page 49 of Wednesday's edition of the paper. It carries the death and funeral announcement of one James Richard Wanjagi, whom the advertiser said died on January 30 "after a failed armed robbery in Nairobi’s Karen estate", and was buried on Tuesday February 6, 2018. “We refer to the publication of a death and funeral of James Richard Wanjagi bearing the picture of Mr Jimi Wanjigi that was erroneously published in the Daily Nation of February 7, 2018,” the company said in a statement. “We regret the pain and anguish this may have caused Mr Wanjigi and his family and sincerely apologise for this.” The company said that it does not condone such publications, which it said went against its editorial policy. “We have taken immediate action against those responsible for the placement of the announcement, including reporting the matter to the police for further investigations,” the company said in a statement.
