A prayer session cum thanksgiving ceremony to welcome Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o back from the United States turned chaotic after irate residents ejected two legislators from the function. Senator Fred Outa and Kisumu Central MP Fred Ouda had to scamper for safety after Prof Nyong’o supporters turned on them, accusing them of undermining the county leadership. The debate was stirred by Nyakach MP Aduma Owuor, who accused Mr Outa of being behind a scheme to take over from Prof Nyong’o, who had gone to seek treatment at the University of California Hospital in the US. “When you were away, some busy bodies were going round peddling lies that you promised them they would take over from you,” he said at Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground. But Prof Nyong’o steered clear of the debate and assured the residents of delivering on his  promises. “I was also working while out of the country. I had discussions with some American investors and we hope to deliver some medical machines in two weeks,” he said.
