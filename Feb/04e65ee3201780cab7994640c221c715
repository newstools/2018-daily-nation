Nasa co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka got a reprieve after the High Court blocked the government from withdrawing his security detail and revoking his firearm. Lady Justice Roselyne Aburili on Friday also barred the State from arresting Mr Musyoka in respect to having the firearm. Mr Musyoka sued the government for revoking his firearm certificate and withdrawal of security detail. In the case, He sued the Interior Cabinet Secretary, the Inspector-General of Police, the Chief Licensing Officer Central Firearm Bureau and the Attorney General. The Wiper leader faulted the January 30 directive to withdraw his security at his residences and revoking his firearm certificate as unreasonable and illegal. Mr Musyoka claimed that he was aggrieved with the government’s actions which he said were done without an explanation or prior notice. “The action by the State has been taken abruptly and capriciously without prior warning and information as to the reasons for withdrawal,” said Mr Musyoka. In the case documents he claimed has owned his firearm since 1998. The firearm licensing Board last month revoked the firearm certificates of several Nasa politicians. The notice gave them until February 1 to surrender their firearms. The government has laid a crackdown on opposition leaders and other individuals said to have been behind the controversial 'swearing in’ of Mr Raila Odinga. According to Mr Musyoka, he wants the impugned directive permanently quashed. The judge asked the government to file a motion of compliance by February 27. The case will be mentioned on February 27 further directions.   Wiper leader says he is ready to be 'sworn-in' as the 'people's deputy president'.
