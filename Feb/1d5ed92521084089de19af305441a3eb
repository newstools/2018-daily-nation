Steeplechaser Beatrice Chepkoech unleashed a powerful kick in the last 200m to win women's 1,500m during the Commonwealth Games trials at Kasarani on Saturday. Chepkoech stunned favourite Winnie Chebet, clocking 4 minutes and 05.5 seconds to triumph. Chebet, who represented Kenya at the World Championships in London last year where she failed to advance to the final, still qualified for the "Club" Games after finishing second in 4:06.1 as Mary Kuria came in third in 4:07.4 to snatch the last qualifying place. The Games' defending 1500m champion Faith Cheng'etich will be missing in action in Gold Coast. Chepng'etich, who is also the Olympic and World champion, is expectant. "It a great win but I am yet to decide whether I will go for the Commonwealth Games," said Chepkoech, who competed for Kenya in 3,000m steeplechase at the London World Championships. Chebet was elated to make her first Commonwealth Games. "I want to atone for the mistake at the World Championships in London with victory in Gold Coast. We shall polish on our endurance and speed," said Chebet.   It was a thriller as Chebet got in front at the bell but Ndiwa caught up with her with 300m to go.
