Taxpayers have been saved Sh7.7 billion through recovery of stolen public assets and averting major corruption deals, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission annual report shows. Through its law enforcement mandate, the commission managed to recover properties and prevented loss of funds through its investigation, prosecution, recovery and disruption of corrupt networks. The report is contained in the EACC 2016/17 fiscal year statement, where the anti-graft body reported the value of loss averted through disruption of corruption networks amounting to Sh6.1 billion. Among the major loss staved off include Sh3 billion irregular sale of land owned by Kenya Railways Staff Benefits Retirement Scheme in Ngara, Nairobi, where a tender for sale of the prime land owned by the pensioners was conducted in unscrupulous manner. ILLEGAL PAYMENTThe flawed tender process for the sale of the 15-acre prime land by the corporate trustee of the pension scheme was stopped and the impugned suspicious dealing aborted. Investigations into the matter and three other cases involving properties owned by Kenya Railways are ongoing, according to the commissionâ€™s chief executive, Mr Halakhe Waqo. The EACC further intensified the disruption of corrupt networks in county governments and thereby averting illegal payments of Sh1.3 billion by Kitui County to undeserving contractors. TENDERSThe commission said the amount involved 89 tenders awarded to suppliers for the construction of roads and bridges within the county. Mr Waqo commended the whistle-blowers who he said alerted the commission of the irregular tendering of the contracts. The commission - through its intelligence network - further acted on a procurement case involving Nairobi County over a tender where a supplier quoted delivery of goods for Sh50 million but the same was awarded at Sh150 million. Some 601 cases are pending in court since 2005 while another 1,223 are still being investigated.
