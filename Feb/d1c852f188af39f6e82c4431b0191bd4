An Anti-stock Theft Unit (ASTU) police officer shot and killed his wife and child at Suswa camp in Subukia, Nakuru. The officer, identified as Cosmas Biwott, is said to have picked a quarrel with his 25-year-old wife before he turned the firearm on her and their daughter. According to their neighbours, the two have been having frequent quarrel and the officer is a known drunkard. Subukia police boss Alex Ng’ang’a said the officer used a colleague’s firearm to shoot the woman and the 5-year-old girl. ON THE RUN Mr Ng’ang’a said the suspect fled and left the firearm behind after committing the murder. “He fled and left the firearm behind after committing the act,” said Mr Ng’ang’a. The victim’s brother, John Nderitu, said he was woken up  by gun shots only to discover that his sister and niece had been murdered. Wambui Nderitu, the victim’s mother, said the couple had separated before her daughter decided to go back to her matrimonial home. A sombre mood engulfed the village as locals tried to come to terms with the sad incident. No one was allowed into the heavily guarded camp. Waseges Ward Rep Kiriethe Ndigirigi who was among the first officials to arrive at the scene said there was need to regulate use of firearms. “There is need to ensure that firearms are kept in safe custody in the armoury because allowing officers to have guns in their houses is very risky,” said Mr Ndigirigi. The ASTU camp has more than 20 police officers who were deployed in the area following rampant cases of cattle theft in the area. Police officers collected 20 spent cartilages from the scene. The two bodies were taken to Nyahururu Hospital Mortuary.
