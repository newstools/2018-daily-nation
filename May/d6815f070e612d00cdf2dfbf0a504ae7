Police in Eldoret yesterday arrested three men suspected to be part of a group selling illicit brews in Munyaka Estate and its environs. More than 300 sachets of Simba Waragi believed to have been smuggled from Uganda was impounded from a house in the estate, where the illicit drinks were kept. Police also impounded a motorbike used to supply the liquor. Village elder Chris Macharia said the brews were being sold to children. “As residents of this estate we are pained by what these people are doing,” he said. He said that some of the dealers stayed next to Munyaka Primary School. The suspects are expected to be arraigned in court as soon as investigations are complete.
