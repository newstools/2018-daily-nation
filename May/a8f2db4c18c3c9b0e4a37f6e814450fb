Only two vehicles per sacco will be allowed into the central business district (CBD) to pick up passengers from Monday. City Hall director of operations Peter Mbaya said the aim of the plan is to decongest the city centre. "Today is sensitization but it will seriously take off on Monday. We are trying to decongest the city centre. "As you know, some people bring up to 100 vehicles in the CBD at a time and that is why you see some parked along the road and people alighting on the road," Mr Mbaya said on Saturday. CONGESTION He said that each vehicle will only be granted five minutes at the allocated slots for dropping and picking up passengers, and those who will not comply will be prosecuted. "It is our expectation that within five minutes the vehicles will be full. "It usually takes matatus a lot of time to fill up because they are many at the bus stops at the same time," he said. The county has been mulling over a total ban of matatus from the city centre, and last month Mr Mbaya oversaw the demolition of illegal structures built on bus termini to pave way for the implementation of the ban. BUS STOPS In the plan, matatus plying Thika, Limuru and Kiambu roads would stop at Murang'a Road A and B, Ngara and Desai stages while those plying Waiyaki Way will stop at Westlands bus stop. Those coming from Lang'ata, Ngong and Mombasa roads are to terminate their journey at Railways Bus Station while those using Jogoo Road will end their journey at Muthurwa and Hakati Bus stations. But Mr Mbaya said the ban is still on hold as construction of some of the termini is yet to be completed.   Nairobi will require 900 buses in all its transport corridors.
