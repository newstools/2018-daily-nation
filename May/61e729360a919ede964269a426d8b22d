The bank, which has been the lead issuer of Nakumatt Global Prepaid cards since 2013, stated that it has halted all transactions carried out on point of sale machines, ATMs or online. “DTB is no longer issuing Nakumatt Global Cards. Cardholders with expired/lost cards as well as new prepaid card applicants will be issued with a new multi-currency DTB prepaid card, which will soon be introduced into the market,” read a notice from the bank to its customers. The bank indicated that customers will be informed on how to access their funds including the option of transferring to the new prepaid card to be launched at in a few weeks or over the counter.
