A woman has died and her companion is fighting for his life in hospital after police shot them while they were in their car near City Park in Nairobi. The two, according to police, had parked their car in a thicket near the park and police became suspicious that it had stayed there for too long. “When officers on patrol approached them and asked them to open the car, they sped off and the officers opened fire at them,” Nairobi County Police Commander Joseph Ole Tito said. Mr Tito said the officers were on foot patrol when they spotted the car. “After the incident, the two were taken to hospital but unfortunately the woman succumbed. The man is still in hospital,” Mr Tito said. A relative of the man said the bullet that hit him on the shoulder also hit the woman in the chest, killing her instantly.
