The change of management at the National Cereals and Produce Board presents a good opportunity to sort out the problems bedevilling the grains sector. We hope the intervention by the Agriculture ministry, under which the parastatal falls, is not cosmetic. It should facilitate an investigation into the sale of subsidised fertiliser and the board’s irregular purchase of maize. For several months, the NCPB has been in the news for turning away farmers when they delivered their produce. The initial explanation was that the depots had been swamped by excess maize, exceeding the money allocated for this year’s purchase. UNSCRUPULOUS TRADERS But it has emerged that some unscrupulous traders have been clandestinely importing maize from Uganda and selling it to the NCPB. That is inexcusable as there are measures to ensure only genuine farmers sell maize to the board. It is a requirement that farmers be vetted by chiefs and agriculture officers. The duty of the management is to ensure that rules are strictly followed. In case of a shortfall, it is the government that sanctions imports. CORRUPTION As far as subsidised fertiliser and maize imports is concerned, we are dealing here with a clear case of corruption. This twin conspiracy has denied genuine farmers an honest return on investment, which could adversely affect production. The ministry should streamline the sector by picking competent managers.
