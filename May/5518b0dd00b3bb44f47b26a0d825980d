A local publisher has termed as fake an image of a page of its Kiswahili Angaza Gredi 1 book that is incorrectly labelled and is being shared on social media. On Friday, The East African Educational Publishers said none of the 50,000 copies it published had such errors and asked police to expedite investigations to nab the culprits behind the counterfeit image or book. The publishing firm said the fake image shows purported page 107 of its book that contains a mislabelled body parts figure. “We have adopted a multifaceted approach in fighting piracy. We have been running a spirited sensitization campaign to alert as well as caution customers about counterfeit books,” said the company chief executive Kiarie Kamau. The company said it published 50,000 copies of the book under the competency-based curriculum pilot programme and asked all parents to ensure that they buy books from recognised distributors. “We work closely with the umbrella body that represents publishers in Kenya, the Kenya Publishers Association, as well as with the Kenya Copyright Board and the Anti-Counterfeit Agency to fight piracy which has become rampant and denies students quality products,” said Mr Kamau. He said the firm has also hired a private investigator to dig into the piracy menace.
