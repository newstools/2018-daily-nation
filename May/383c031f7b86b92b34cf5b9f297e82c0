Two school girls drowned on Monday after falling into a dam in Mandera County. The two, according to Libehia ward representative Farah Abdi Abdinoor, were looking after their families’ goats when they drowned in Gumbiso on Monday evening. “It is unfortunate that we lost school-going girls in my ward to floods,” said Mr Abdinoor who is also Mandera deputy Speaker. He said the dams pose a danger to the local community during the rainy seasons. Mr Abdinoor now wants those contracted to build dams in the county to always put a fence around them after completing their work. The girls were buried on Monday evening, hours after their bodies were retrieved by locals. The MCA said floods continue to cause a lot of damage in farms in the ward. “All the farms along the river have been destroyed putting locals at the risk of starvation,” he said. He appealed for food aid and mosquito nets from both the national and county governments. “We have homes that are submerged and unless these people are assisted they stand to suffer,” he said. He warned that the local community risks contracting waterborne disease due to floods. “Mosquitoes are breeding and the water for home usage is contaminated putting many at risk,” he said.
