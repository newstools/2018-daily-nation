A judge on Wednesday directed former Government Chief Pathologist Moses Njue to present himself before the Directorate of Criminal Investigations over allegations that he stole the heart of a dead man. Justice Florence Muchemi ruled that if Dr Njue fails to appear as directed, the bail he had obtained blocking his arrest will be discharged. The court had granted him a Sh200,000 bail. HEART Dr Njue is to face charges of stealing Mr Benedict Karau’s heart. In the case, Mr Karau’s family filed a complaint with the police and the matter was investigated by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who recommended that he be charged in court. Mr Karau died on March 2, 2015 at his home in Meru and his heart was found to be missing a few months after Dr Njue allegedly  performed a postmortem. However, before he could be arraigned in court, the pathologist rushed to the High Court and obtained orders stopping his planned arrest and subsequent charging in court, arguing that the case was instigated out of malice. Dr Njue has been charged in a different case together with his son Lemuel Anasha Mureithi with stealing the heart of Mr Timothy Mwandi Muumbo. Other than stealing the heart, Dr Njue denied a further count of destroying the heart, to conceal evidence. The court heard that he knew that the autopsy report would be used as evidence in a case pending in court. Mr Muumbo died in unclear circumstances on June 22, 2015 at his Dik Dik Gardens in Kileleshwa, Nairobi. They denied the charges and were freed on a Sh300,000 cash bail.   Two closure notices were issued in 2016 and 2017 but the school failed to comply.
