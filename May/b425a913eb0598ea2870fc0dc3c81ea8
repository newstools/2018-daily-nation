A fourth suspect has been charged in a Nairobi court in connection with the recent violent attack on former Nairobi Central Business District Association Chairman Timothy Muriuki. Brian Shem Owino was charged with violently robbing Mr Muriuki of Sh100,000. Nairobi Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi heard that Mr Owino and others not before the court injured Mr Muriuki when they interrupted his press conference two weeks ago at Hotel Boulevard. Mr Owino denied the charge and was freed on Sh200,000 cash bail. Principal Prosecution Counsel Solomon Naulikha said he will apply for consolidation of Mr Owinoâ€™s case with that of East African Legislative Assembly (Eala) MP Simon Mbugua, Anthony Otieno Ombok alias Jamal, and Benjamin Odhiambo Onyango alias Odhis. He also requested that the case be mentioned on May 23 before Senior Principal Magistrate Martha Mutuku where the other case will also be mentioned. The suspect through his lawyer asked the court that he be supplied with the necessary documents in order for him to prepare his defence adequately. He also pleaded that he be released on reasonable bond term. A fifth suspect, Stephen Sangira, was freed after police found no evidence linking him to the incident.   Kenyans have questioned why it has taken long to get hold of the five men.
