Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has said he will maintain lawyer Miguna Miguna as his deputy. "I have chosen Miguna as my deputy and it is the assembly which will decide," Governor Sonko said on Sunday at A.I.P.C.A in Njiru Ward. The position feel vacant after Mr Polycarp Igathe resigned in January. Governor Sonko said he will not be distracted by cartels hell-bent on making sure he fails to deliver. "I will not give room to those who want to derail my vision. My focus is service delivery to Nairobians," he said. On the corruption crisis blighting the nation, he challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta to make sure those behind the maize and National Youth Service saga are prosecuted. He was accompanied by County Assembly Majority Leader Abdi Guyo and Chief Whip Chege Mwaura. Mr Guyo said the governor should be supported to fully deliver on his promises. "We will never ever impeach Sonko, take it to the bank. Cartels have no role in Sonkoâ€™s leadership," he said.   Tavevo Water and Sewerage Company is operating at a loss.
