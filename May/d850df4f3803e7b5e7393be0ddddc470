Kilifi County government on Wednesday dispatched more than 3,000 condoms to flood victims camping at Garashi Secondary school. County Health Minister Anisa Omar in a statement said her department had also set a clinic in one of the buildings at the school to address health issues resulting from congestion witnessed at the moment. “Treatment of all minor illnesses including a provision of condoms and contraceptives is ongoing at the camp. More than 3,000 condoms have been given out and we shall keep on re-filing when needs arises,” Dr Anisa said  adding “ We set a clinic at the camp manned by two health workers, where one works during the day and another at night.” On Monday evening, more than 6,000 flood victims asked the county government to distribute contraceptives including condoms in their camps. The call by the elders at the camp was because of fear of rise in number of sexually transmitted diseases when such  a big group lives together. They asked the government to consider it as a matter of urgency because danger was lurking at the camp.   More than 6,000 Kilifi residents were displaced and most of them are camping at Garashi.
