All dams in Kenya are set to undergo inspection in wake of the Patel Dam burst that killed 45 people in Solai, Nakuru County. Water and Irrigation secretary Simon Chelugui said the dams will be inspected to ensure they do not endanger lives. The CS said some dams were built during colonial times and the national government will work with counties to inspect them to ensure they are safe. "We will dispatch experts and engineers to inspect materials used, whether they were built on water ways, and if the engineers who oversaw their construction were licensed. We do not want any other tragedy," said Mr Chelugui. Mr Chelugui spoke when he toured the killer Patel Dam. The dam, built within a coffee farm, burst its banks on Wednesday night releasing over 70 million litres of water that gushed down flattening an entire village. Forty people are still unaccounted for following the tragedy. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui who accompanied him welcomed the inspection of all the water bodies, saying that will ensure safety of people. Mr Kinyanjui said water levels in the remaining dams next to the killer one at the Patel farm have been reduced as regulated discharge of water continues. The Water CS also delivered a message of condolence from President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. CS Chelugui said the national government will work with the county towards holding a memorial and prayer service for the Patel Dam victims.   Most of the people were caught unawares as all were engulfed in their normal chores.
