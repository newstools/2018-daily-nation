LAUSANNE Fifa has ended a doping investigation into Russian footballers named in the country's provisional World Cup squad after finding "insufficient evidence" of any wrongdoing, it said on Tuesday. World football's governing body launched a probe into "possible anti-doping rule violations" by players "against whom a suspicion had been raised" following the publication of the McLaren report on mass doping in Russia.
