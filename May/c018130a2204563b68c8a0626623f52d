Bobasi MP Innocent Obiri has been charged with breach of peace in a Kisii court. Mr Obiri was charged alongside his bodyguard Charles Nyakweba, who was accused of assault and malicious damage to property. They both denied the charges and were released on a cash bail of Sh100, 000 each or bond of Sh200,000. The duo appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Julius Mutahi. The MP was on Sunday evening locked up at Kisii Central Police Station. He arrived in Kisii sandwiched between plain-clothes officers in a white car, which ferried him from Nairobi. The first-time legislator, who was elected on a People's Democratic Party ticket, was arrested on Saturday afternoon outside Hilton Hotel Nairobi after days on the run. Police have been looking for Mr Obiri since Wednesday for allegedly storming into a quarry owned by a company called County 45. The MP had gone to protest against blasting at the site, saying it was causing cracks to houses and schools in Masongo, Nyamonema Bobasi, where the quarry is located. Mr Obiri spent Saturday night at Central Police, Nairobi, before he was transferred to Kisii.   A detachment of 15 special crimes officers escorted MP from Nairobi to Kisii where he was thrown in police cells.
