St Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Kiambu has withdrawn a case involving one of its priests, leaving many members angry. The priest, who has since been sent on leave, is alleged to have unlawfully taken Sh700,000 offertory from the church’s vestry last month. When the church leadership learnt of the disappearance of the cash, they reported the matter to the Kiambu Police Station, with their main suspects apparently being the subordinate staff. However, an internal investigation, which included reviewing security camera recordings, is reported to have directly linked the priest to the lost cash. The matter was reported to the head of the church, John Cardinal Njue, who sent the priest on leave and appointed a priest from a neighbouring parish to act in his place. The church also withdrew the case even before detectives could  investigate the matter, angering church members who want that matter investigated thoroughly. Yesterday, the Kiambu Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss, Paul Wambugu, told Nation there was nothing they could do. “The matter was reported but later withdrawn after it was solved amicably by the church. The police cannot go on investigating what happened since we had not concluded the matter to enable us to tell whether the money was stolen or not. It’s only they (church) who can tell how they resolved the matter,” Mr Wambugu said.
