On Tuesday, his friend Jacob Muchemi joined him in the demo. “If Kenyans were united and spoke in one voice, the government would be compelled to be accountable and transparent,” he said. “We cannot leave it to the government to fight corruption. We must express our displeasure at the government.” he said. Mr Waihenya, 31, said he turned to hawking after he failed to secure a job when he completed his undergraduate studies. Initially he worked as a guard with various security companies until last year when he resigned following a row with his employer over salary.

He became noticeable on the streets last week when he protested demanding the Salaries and Remuneration Commission implements a pay cut on MPS and other senior government officials who pocket millions in salaries and allowances.
