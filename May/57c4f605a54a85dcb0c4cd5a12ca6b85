Kenya’s national cricket team’s poor batting performance in international assignments has been blamed on lack of proper training equipment. A lackluster performance culminated in Kenya being demoted to ICC World Cricket League Division Three in February. Kenya’s former national team player, Kennedy Obuya who appeared in three successive editions of the International Cricket Council World Cup between 1996 and 2003, said that the demolition of Kenya Cricket Academy at Sikh Union which was partly taken up by the construction of the Thika Super Highway, left the team without proper training ground. He said: “The team requires at least four grass strips and two astral tuff for nets with three bowling machines and 100 bowling balls per machine. The team also requires white balls for training, which is not the case with Kenya now.” Obuya, who is also a founder member of Obuya Academy Cricket team which was promoted to the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association Supper League last season, said it was sad that his academy is better equipped than the national team. Although Obuya retired from Kenya’s squad in 2006, he did far much better with the bat last season than most of the current national team players. In last season’s batting averages in NPCA league last season, Obuya finished eighth position with 442 runs. He was 20 runs behind his younger brother, Collins, one of the senior players in the national team. The national player with the most runs was Rakep Patel (765), who turns up for Kanbis.
