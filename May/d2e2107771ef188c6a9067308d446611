FRAUDSTERS This comes as the Kenya National Examination Council issued a warning to parents asking them not to fall prey to fraudsters. Acting  Knec chief executive Mercy Karogo on Monday issued the warning as she assured the country that preparations for the 2018 national examinations are firmly on track. “The council wishes to categorically state that as has been the case in the last two years, all measures have been put in place to ensure that examination materials are safe,” she said. Ms Karogo said measures have been put in place to ensure that no one will breech the council’s enhanced security. She advised parents and candidates not to be duped into purchasing any material purported to be genuine examination questions.   This year, 1.7 million candidates have registered for the national exams.
