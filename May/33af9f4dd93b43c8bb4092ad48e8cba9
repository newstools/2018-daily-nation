It is shocking that Kenyan athlete Asbel Kiprop, one of the world’s greatest middle-distance runners, has been linked to performance-enhancing drugs. Kiprop has protested his innocence and investigations are ongoing. However, if found guilty by the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) Independent Disciplinary Tribunal, the three-time World 1,500 metres champion could be banned for up to four years. His charge is use of blood-boosting Erythropoietin. Even though Kenya is once again on the world radar concerning doping, the authorities should not relent in the fight against the vice. CHEATING The fact that athletes are being caught for cheating means the system works. This comes months after Olympic marathon champion Jemimah Sumgong failed the test, just as marathoner Rita Jeptoo and sprinters Joyce Sakari and Francisca Koki. It is time Kenyan athletes focused on winning clean since the country has enormous potential and talent and they don’t have to rely on banned substances. But Kiprop’s case raises pertinent questions that IAAF should address, especially about the Athletes Integrity Unit’s Doping Control Officers and particularly his allegations of extortion and tampering of his samples. JUSTICE Even though the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (Adak) didn’t handle Kiprop’s case, they should ensure justice prevails. IAAF, Wada and Adak must develop temper proof systems where tests are done without their DCO being compromised. The admission that an AIU DCO received money from Kiprop casts aspersion on the whole process hence a credible case can be ruined. The government and Athletics Kenya must now act on Managements whose athletes have become synonymous with doping.
