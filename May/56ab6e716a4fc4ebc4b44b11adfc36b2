Former Kenya Premier League side Nakuru All Stars came from a goal down to hold the visiting Nairobi Stima to a 1-1 draw in a mid-week National Super League match played at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru on Wednesday. All Stars, under the guidance of former AFC Leopards coach Ezekiel Akhwana, are struggling for form this term, and remain rooted at the bottom of the 19-team standings. Stima came all guns blazing from the first minute and were 1-0 up six minutes into the match after John Kangâ€™ethe's rasping shot beat goalkeeper Tom Kangeta.   The visitors continued to attack but All Stars kept them at bay as both teams headed for the breather with Stima 1-0 up. On resumption, All Stars stepped up and were rewarded when Jerome Baraka put the ball beyond the reach of goalkeeper John Njau to ensure his side collects a point from the match. All Stars visit Talanta FC for their next match on Sunday at Camp Toyoyo grounds in Nairobi, while Stima will be away to Administration Police (AP) in Naivasha on the same day.
