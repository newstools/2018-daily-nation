A woman who was jailed for 15 years for defiling a 16-year-old boy has filed a notice of appeal against the sentence Judith Wandera was on Wednesday found guilty of defilement and performing an indecent act on a minor contrary to Sexual Offences Act, on July 5, 2017 at Kicomi area. Her lawyers, Dome and Kedogo Advocates,  said their client was dissatisfied with the  15-year jail term sentence. Kisumu Deputy Registrar Pauline Mbulika confirmed to the Nation that she received the notice of appeal. Seven witnesses testified against her in the case while she never presented any, only defending herself during the entire trial. The magistrate, after considering all the evidence presented by the complainant, ruled that she agreed the two knew each other and had sex on numerous occasions. Principal Magistrate Joan Wambilyanga in her judgement said the two were arrested on July 17, one year after they had started getting sexually involved. “Both admitted having sex, sometimes protected, sometimes unprotected. According to her, she could not tell how many times they did it,” said Ms Wambilyanga. In her defence, Wandera claimed she could not establish that the boy was a minor on the first day they met.
