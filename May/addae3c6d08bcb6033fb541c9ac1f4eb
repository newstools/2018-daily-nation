Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has ordered investigative agencies to present him with files relating to the misuse of funds at the National Cereals and Produce Board and Kenya Pipeline Company. Mr Haji said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission should furnish him with details of the financial scandals to assess evidence before taking anyone to court. Public Service and Youth Affairs PS Lillian Mbogo, National Youth Service Director-General Richard Ndubai and more than 50 others have appeared in court over the Sh9 billion scandal at NYS. NCPB is on the spot over some Sh2 billion paid to traders who supplied it with huge quantities of maize at the expense of farmers. At least Sh600 million is said to have been lost at KPC after a flawed tendering. Kenya Power, another State corporation, dismissed some of its workers over irregular awarding of tenders. However, Kenya Power MD Ken Tarus has denied reports that money was lost. About 13 traders are said to have colluded with the NCPB management that saw the billions of shillings paid to them in a month. Agriculture Principal Secretary Richard Lesiyampe said NCPB managing director Newton Terer resigned two weeks ago after he questioned the dealings at the parastatal.   National Assembly majority leader says culprits must be held accountable.
