Kenya’s Judy Waguthii will face Prisca Vicot from France for the vacant World Boxing Council Silver Super Lightweight title on Saturday in Glattbrug, Switzerland. The 33-year-old Waguthii, who has had a shot at the World Boxing Association (WBA) Super Lightweight and International Boxing Organisation (IBO) Female Super Lightweight titles before, said she is ready for the bout. Waguthii, who has been training with Kenya Defence Forces boxing team under head coach Sammy Magima at Jamhuri Park showground, is due to leave the country on Wednesday at 10.30pm for the bout. “Though not popular, I have watched a few of Vicot video clips and I am certain I will beat her,” said Waguthii. Waguthii’s last bout was on November 27 last year in Luzhniki, Moscow, where she lost the (IBO) World Female Super Lightweight title to home boxer Svetlana Kulakova on a controversial split points decision. It was Kulakova’s first defence of the (IBO) World Female Super Lightweight belt she had won on December 3, 2016, having beaten Vicot on unanimous decision at Khodynka Ice Palace, Moscow. Waguthii had lost to Kulakova when they battled for the (WBA) World Super Lightweight title on August 24, 2013. Waguthii also took a shot at the WBA World Female Featherweight title, her first major bout against South Korean Hwa-Won Lee on April 30, 2007 where she lost on a unanimous decision. “Kenyans should expect a good fight since I have prepared well,” said Waguthii, who is likely to get a shot at the WBC World Female Super Lightweight title if she dethrones Vicot. Érica Anabella Farías of Argentina is the reigning WBC Female Super lightweight champion, having won the belt four years ago. Fatuma Zarika is the only Kenyan woman to win the WBC World belt in the Super bantamweight category. Waguthii boasts of 15 wins, seven losses and four draws in 26 bouts while the 42-year-old Vicot, who is based in Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, has a 6-3 record in nine bouts.
