Mothers and newborns have been left stranded following a 2am fire at the maternity wing of  Mbagathi Hospital in Nairobi. The building that caught fire was constructed in 2014 and was last month condemned by city county engineers. The engineers declared the block structurally unsound after hospital staff complained that cracks were all over. According to witnesses, it was a busy night at the maternity wing as clients brought in mothers in labour when the flames broke out. Women in labour, mothers and their newborns were forced out of the building into the rainy darkness as hospital staff battled to put out the fire. “The building has many cracks and has no fire extinguishers,” a nurse, who sought anonymity for fear of reprisals, told the Nation. “We were forced to borrow lanterns and paraffin from the National Spinal Injury Hospital in Hurlingham.” The nurse said hospital staff had constantly complained over the cracks in the nursery, fearing that the building may collapse on the newborns. Immediately the fire broke, the source said, the maternity wing’s main power switch was switched off— sparking panic among mothers who had children at the incubators. The building has since been sealed off. No injuries or fatalities have been reported. Kilimani police boss Michael Muchiri confirmed the incident, saying 16 newborns were in the incubator at the time. “There was a power blackout in one of the sections… fortunately there were no fatalities,” he said. Mr Muchiri said the hospital was working on how to move the babies to Kenyatta National Hospital as it battled to restore power supply. He said police were concerned about the failure of the hospital’s back-up generator when electricity went off.  More follows.
