Villagers of Randani in Kisii County have razed the house of a man suspected of killing his neighbour over a Sh100 debt. The Monday incident in Bomachoge Borabu followed the murder of Mr James Karori, 22, on Sunday. Mr Karori was in a group of nine labourers contracted on Saturday for a roofing job. He was reportedly given Sh1,000 to share out with the other workers, among them the suspect Donald Onyango. NECK SLASHED Witnesses told Nation that Mr Karori paid out Sh800 to his colleagues but delayed remitting Sh100, claiming he had no change. But on Sunday morning, the suspect slashed Mr Karori's neck killing him instantly. Kenyenya Sub-County police boss Isaac Thuranira said Mr Onyango is still at large and appealed for information that may lead to his arrest. "We are following up strong leads that may lead to his arrest," he told the Nation on phone. MOTIVE Mr Karori's mother Mary Oisebe said she could not understand why a person they had lived with for years had killed her son. Mr Karori's brother Denis Ogechi said: "We donâ€™t know exactly if all that led to his death was the Sh100 because we had even offered to pay him but he turned us down, only to insist that all he wanted was to kill him." The suspect is a trader at Magena Shopping Centre.
