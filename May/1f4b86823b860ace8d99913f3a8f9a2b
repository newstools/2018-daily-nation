Isaack Nderitu won the men’s 10,000 metres on the first day of the Athletics Kenya Track and Field meet at Shanzu Teachers Training College in Mombasa on Friday. Nderitu, who won the 2016 10km Road Race in Japan, and finished second in the 10,000m event in the same country in 2015, crossed the finishing line in a time of 35 minutes 16.0 seconds. Eric Manani of Moi Airbase finished second in 35:19.0 with his team mate Felix Akibor taking third position in 38:60.0. Immediately after wrapping up the race, Nderitu warned his aim was to secure a place in the Kenya team for the Africa Senior Athletics Championship in Asaba, Nigeria in August. “I’ve been training hard to win this race and could have registered a better time if the ground was not slippery due to heavy rains in this place,” said Nderitu who also hinted at shifting gears to half marathon in the coming two months. Changamwe Police constable Catherine Iseren was cheered loudly by the home supporters as she completed the women's 10,000m race, where she won in 39:40.0 followed by Damaris Burongo (41:46.0) as Kasize Mutisya crossed the line third after clocking 42 :18.0. Iseren, the 2015 10,000m winner of the Kenya Secondary Schools Athletics Championship, said the victory had given her morale to also feature with intent in next weekend’s meeting in Nyeri. She also said she was aiming for a spot in the Asaba continental championship. An hour after completing the 10,000m race, Iseren did battle in the 5,000m finishing fourth in 20:16.0. The event was won by Florence Nduku of Machakos in 17:25.0 with her colleague Benedeta Mbithe finishing second in 17:35.0 while individual entrant Eunice Mwakina claimed third place in 18:32.0. Dominant Maureen Jelagat of Prisons, fresh from the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, won 100m and 100m hurdles events, clocking 12.30 and 15.8 respectively.
