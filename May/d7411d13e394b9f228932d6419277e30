Forty eight students and two teachers of Turbo Girls High School have sustained light injuries after their school bus overturned on the Sugoi-Kosichei road on Sunday. The students have been rushed to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) where doctors said they are in a stable condition. "Most of them sustained soft tissue injuries but their lives are out of danger. We have also counselled them as some suffered a lot of shock," said MTRH chief executive Wilson Aruasa. The students were heading back to their school after attending a career talk at the neighbouring Kosachei Secondary School when the accident occurred at about 3pm. Emergency medical responders first took them to the Turbo sub-County Hospital but they were transferred to the MTRH in Eldoret for specialised treatment. Turbo Deputy County Commissioner Mohammed Mwabudzo who confirmed the incident attributed it to the ongoing heavy rains in the region. "Heavy rains pounding the region is causing poor visibility. We call on motorists to exercise caution during this season," said Mr Mwabudzo. The accident caused a heavy traffic snarl up along the busy route.
