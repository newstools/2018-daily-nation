A selection panel has bypassed former Salaries and Remuneration Commission Chairperson Sarah Serem and her Transition Authority (TA) counterpart Kinuthia Wamwangi to shortlist only 10 applicants out of 112 to head the Public Service Commission. Ms Serem’s term ended in December last year, while that of Mr Wamwangi terminated when the TA ceased to exist in 2016. Also bypassed in the race to replace Prof Margaret Kobia, who is now the Public Service secretary, are 2017 Bungoma governor aspirant Alfred Khangati, Prof Laban Ayiro, who acted as Moi University vice-chancellor for over a year before Prof Isaac Kosgey was named to replace him, and former Education permanent secretary Prof George Godia. SHORTLIST Former Egerton University vice-chancellor James Tuitoek tops the list of 10 who were shortlisted to head the commission whose role now includes interviewing principal secretaries before they are nominated by the president. Ms Njoki Kahiga, who briefly acted as the Public Service principal secretary in 2013 before she was nominated as a commissioner in the Kenya Law Review Commission for a five-year-term,  has also been shortlisted for the chairperson post. Others shortlisted are: Mr Jonathan Ltipalei, Ms Rodah Awinja, Mr Stephen Kirogo, Ms Rukia Sheik, Mr Baraka Garise, Mr Juster Nkoroi, Ms Rose Aoko, and Ms Lyn Cherop Mengich. Prof Tuitoek, Mr Ltipalei, Ms Awinja, Mr Kirogo, and Ms Sheik will be interviewed on May 29, while the rest will face the panel the following day. “Members of the public are invited to [submit0 in writing any credible information of interest relating to any of the shortlisted candidates,” the selection panel said in an advert in the dailies on Wednesday.
