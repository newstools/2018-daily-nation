A boda boda operator who admitted defiling and impregnating his lover’s 17-year-old daughter has been jailed for 15 years. A Nakuru court heard that Memoses Ondachi committed the offence in the house belonging to the minor’s mother at Kabachia estate within Nakuru town between January 1 and May 11, 2018. Principal Magistrate Joe Omido, while convicting the man, said the accused had saved the court time by admitting the charges. “The court has considered the charges and circumstances under which the offence occurred and has noted that the accused admitted, of his own volition, committing the offence. Further, because he is a first offender, the court is inclined to give him a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison,” the principal magistrate ruled on Tuesday. SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP According to the police report, Ondachi, who has been living with the girl’s mother for 13 years, lured the girl into a sexual relationship earlier this year and had sex with her over the period. The court heard that the man would defile the girl while her mother was away. It is the girl’s brother who found her in the man’s room on the night of May 12, while the mother was away. PREGNANCY TEST He reported the matter to the mother the following day who, upon interrogating her, confirmed that the two had been engaging in sexual intercourse for more than four months. She suspected that the girl was pregnant, which prompted her to take her to hospital for testing. The test results from the Nairobi Women’s Hospital confirmed that the girl was 20 weeks pregnant. The matter was reported to Bondeni Police Station before the suspect was arrested and presented in court.
