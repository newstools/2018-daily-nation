Majority Leader Aden Duale has suspended a proposed law on exploration of oil. Mr Duale said he suspended the Petroleum (Exploration, Development and Production) Bill on Wednesday evening after realising that the Energy Committee was changing too many clauses in the draft law he has sponsored on behalf of the government. CHANGES The majority leader said he had been monitoring progress of the bill when he realised that the committee’s Vice-Chairman Robert Pukose was making changes that had not been published in the Order Paper. The committee had proposed amendments to more than 50 clauses in the bill and introduced a new part. “The vice-chair was moving new clauses...I had to sit with the research team in my office and was asking what these new clauses that were not in the Order Paper are,” said Mr Duale. He was backed by Kipipiri MP Amos Kimunya. “We all want to be fairly informed about the amendments that are taking place. The changes are so fundamental that I would like to see reasoned research on all of them,” said Mr Kimunya. But while other MPs agreed with Mr Duale’s request, Turkana South MP James Lomenen  and his North Horr counterpart Chachu Ganya were not happy. Mr Lomenen was among the handful of MPs working on the bill, which sets the percentages of revenue from oil to be shared amongst counties and  communities where the oil is found. “The House is in the process of dealing with this bill. Why are you stopping it? Maybe there are people who have interests in this bill, and we are watching. We will not allow it,” said Mr Lomenen. “As leaders from these regions, we are watching,” said Mr Ganya.
