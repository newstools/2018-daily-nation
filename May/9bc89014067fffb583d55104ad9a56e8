The Migori High Court has upheld the nomination of 10 county assembly members by ODM party. Justice Antony Murimi said the nomination list sent to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) could not be altered once submitted. "While dealing with augment raised by the appellant according to sub-section 34/7 of the Act, a party list once submitted to the IEBC cannot be changed," Justice Murimi said on Thursday. "I take the position that it is only the political party that submitted the party list that is barred by law from attempting to change the party list, but the provision cannot bar a court of law from doing what is constitutionally provided in the law," he said. "The appellants did not advance compelling reasons to nullify the nomination." GLAD The judge said the process was legal. Migori ODM branch chairman Phillip Makabongo said they are happy with the judgment. "We are all happy with the judgment of today. These are the people we nominated and there was no irregularity in the nomination," he said. The petition was filed by nine voters in the county represented by lawyers Nyasime Nyamori and Mr Kennedy Okong'o. And ODM was represented by Odhiambo Roche and Chris Ayieko. The nominees are Milicent Akinyi, Elizabeth Tala, Rose Aoro, Mary Dande, Ruth Oyamo, Clarice Doli, Grace Akinyi, Florence Abich, Dorine Dande and Rose Adhiambo.
