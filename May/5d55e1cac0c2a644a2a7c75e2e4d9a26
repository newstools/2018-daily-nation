Strathmore Leos II are this year’s Mwamba Cup champions. The Leos roared to their first 15s titles in seven years when they beat Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) II 19-3 during the delayed final at the Impala Sports Club grounds on Saturday. Fly-half Gideon Makumi, who was declared man-of-the-match, converted prop Andrew Okot’s try besides curling over four penalties to spur Leos to victory. The Leos led 13-3 at the break before coasting to their first 15s victory since winning Impala Floodlit title in 2011. Stephen “Zola” Osumba scored a drop goal for KCB but that failed to rescue them from Leos’ jaws. “Though scrappy, we dominated the game throughout. It's good to end the season on a high," said Strathmore Leos coach John Mbai. Leos 15s players will rest for a month before resuming training for the 2018/2019 Kenya Cup season. Meanwhile, champions Upper Hill School launched their Homeboyz Prescott Cup title defence strongly when they edged out Ofafa Jericho 21-13 during the first festival at Nairobi School on Saturday. Upper Hill, who won the diadem in 2016 and 2017, are the tournament’s top seeds, highlighting Pool “A”. Muhuri Muhiri also launched their campaign in Pool “A” on the right footing, dismantling Strathmore 41-5. In Pool “B”, Rift Valley Academy beat Mang’u 20-5 while Lenana crushed Saint Mary’s 24-0. In Damu Changa, Ofafa Jericho II rattled Upper Hill II 10-5 while Strathmore II beat Muhuri Muchiri II 17-3. Mang’u II whacked Rift Valley Academy II 29-0. In Damu Pevu, Thika High thrashed Kiambu 17-0 while Jamhuri mauled Githiga 46-7 with Dagoretti crushing Aquinas 60-0. Damu Pevu and Prescott Cup will take a break to pave way for Blackrock Festival to be hosted at St Mary's School next weekend. Action resumes on May 26 with the second festival at Lenana School.
