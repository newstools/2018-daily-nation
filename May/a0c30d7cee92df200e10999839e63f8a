Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo says he suffered a malaria attack which is now under control. In a tweet early Sunday, the ODM legislator said: "Didnâ€™t know Malaria can be so dangerous! Developed malaria which the doctors say was starting to affect the brain! Fortunately all is under control now!" Dr Amollo is hospitalised at Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu after collapsing on Saturday during a funeral ceremony in Alego Usonga, Siaya County. He and other leaders among them Senate Minority Leader James Orengo, MPs Samwel Atandi (Alego Usonga), Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) and Oburu Odinga (EALA) were consoling the family of former Alego Usonga MP Peter Oloo Aringo who lost his son Tom Gemma Aringo to cancer. After collapsing he was taken to Bondo Medical Centre where he was given first aid, and then transferred to Aga Khan Hospital. Senator Orengo had said that: "We don't have a crisis. Otiende is stable. He just needs a rest." Further, Dr Julius Okel, the Consultant Physician at Aga Khan Hospital, on Saturday said that "Otiende is in stable condition and that tests are currently being taken on him".
