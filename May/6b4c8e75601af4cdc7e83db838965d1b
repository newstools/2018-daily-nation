The national tree planting drive, which President Uhuru Kenyatta launched in Nairobi Saturday, is a most significant confirmation of the government’s commitment to the conservation of forests. It comes at a time when the grave consequences of environmental degradation have become so starkly evident. From a prolonged drought that devastated, especially the arid and semi-arid lands, the impact of the floods from the current heavy rains could have been stemmed had the water catchment areas and farmlands not have been so badly stripped of vegetation. Despite recent concerted efforts, the country’s forest cover stands at only 7.4 per cent of its total land area, compared to 12 per cent some 50 years ago. WATER CRISIS The United Nations advocates that all countries must strive to attain 10 per cent forest cover. Experts have long warned that the continued destruction of forests will lead to a water crisis and other adverse effects. President Kenyatta’s new effort was meant to plant 26,000 trees on Saturday, with the campaign being rolled out simultaneously in all the 47 counties. Indeed, this campaign calls for much more than the one-off involvement of leaders. It must be sustained and this is possible through the participation of not just the leaders but also individuals, organisations and the private sector. POSITIVE IMPACT Corporates such as Nation Media Group and Family Bank are partnering with the Ministry of the Environment and Forestry and the Kenya Forest Service in a new tree planting initiative that is bound to have a positive impact. We hope that other corporates will be inspired enough to play a part in this. Also laudable is the government’s pledge for critical reforms to raise the national forest cover to 10 per cent, in line with the UN advocacy.
