The Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) will hold its long overdue elections next month after the federation has amended its current constitution, the federation’s president John Kameta has said. At the same time, Kameta said all BAK affiliates which have not complied with the Sports Act must do so before next month for them to take part in the elections. Kameta was reacting to a question directed to Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa by Kenya’s former international flyweight boxer, Sugar Ray Kuria, that appeared in the Ask you Question section of Sunday Nation of April 29. Kuria had asked Echesa what he would do to ensure that BAK complies with 2013 Sports Act by holding elections. Kuria also observed that BAK had not held elections which were due last year in April. In his response, Echesa he will set up a caretaker committee, just as he did with cricket, to ensure that BAK abides with the Constitution and 2013 Sports Act. Echesa said that the current BAK officials were in contravention of Kenyan laws. Kameta said the federation has complied with the Sports Act, but it erroneously addressed its documents to the Registrar of Societies instead of the Registrar for Sports. He said BAK would correct the mistake and forward its documents to Registrar for Sports.
