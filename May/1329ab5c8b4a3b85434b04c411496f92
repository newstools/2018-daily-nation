Tetu MP James Gichuhi has called for a review of the law to introduce death sentence and stiff penalties for those found guilty of misuse of public funds. Mr Gichuhi said the only way to eliminate corruption is for those culpable to be put behind bars. “We want the DPP to do thorough investigation that will be adduced in the court to ensure someone is held responsible for the loot,” he said. Poorly-done investigations, he said, have led to acquittal of looters of public funds. “Comprehensive investigations must be done and the DPP must go after the big fish,” he added. He was speaking at St Lawrence Ithenguri Catholic Church in Tetu where he attend Mass on Sunday. Mr Gichuhi was referring to the graft scandal that has gripped the National Youth Service leading to the suspension of staff and stepping aside of senior managers. The MP lauded the stepping aside of Public Service PS Lillian Mbogo-Omollo and NYS Director-General Richard Ndubai to allow investigators conclude probe into the alleged loss of Sh9 billion at the institution.   Wandayi said culprits implicated in the fiasco must be prosecuted.
