Nyeri County Assembly has approved the appointment of Caroline Karugu to the post of Deputy Governor. The assembly approved her by a simple majority on Wednesday shortly after 7pm following an afternoon-long debate in the chambers. The debate which started at 2pm stirred praise for the nominee as well as opposition and criticism from members of the county assembly. HIGH SCORE While Ms Karugu scored high during vetting by the countyâ€™s appointment committee, it was up to the assembly to approve or reject her nomination. Leader of Majority James Kanyugo tabled the report seeking its adoption to give a green light for appointment of Ms Karugu. Those who supported the motion, cited her strong credentials while those who opposed her nomination claimed she is not in touch with Nyeri residents. Governor Mutahi Kahiga nominated Ms Karugu as his deputy last month. He took leadership of the county following the death of Wahome Gakuru late last year.
