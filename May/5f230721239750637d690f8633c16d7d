An award-winning musician has described Kenyan artistes as the most hardworking people in the entertainment industry. RnB singer Habida said most musicians have been consistent in releasing their music. Habida, however, noted that it is tough being in the industry, especially for female musicians. EVENTS “This is the reason why few women sing secular music. It is quite unfortunate that women in the music industry are still not yet taken seriously. Most of the time we end being paid less than what male singers earn,” she said. She added that even many corporates do not use female artistes regularly in their events. Habida started her music career more than five years ago, gaining recognition with the hit song Sunshine that she collaborated with fellow musician Nameless. STRUGGLING She has also ventured into the acting scene featuring in several TV shows. However, she says that she is still disappointed that the acting scene is still struggling, something that discourages many from joining it as a career. “As musicians, we also struggle. Making a good track is expensive and people are not paying for shows. Our songs are not getting played over and over. There are many issues that need to be fixed,” she said. In 2016, she moved to South Africa and was signed by Gallo Records. But she returned home the following year. REMIX “I felt like God was calling me home. I had to promote my own country because our music doesn’t cross borders much.” She said the music industry needs a lot of support to help aspiring artistes to thrive. “I would advise upcoming artistes not to join music if their hearts are not in it. This is an industry where you should not care about making money until years later.” Habida has released an extended playlist that is a short version of an album, that has three songs and a remix, and is also working on reality TV show.
