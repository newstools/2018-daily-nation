Majority of the students from Turbo Girls High School who were involved in a road crash on Sunday have been discharged from hospital. Forty eight students and two teachers were admitted to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret after their bus overturned on the Sugoi- Kosachei road. INJURIES MTRH Chief Executive Officer Dr Wilson Aruasa said two students who sustained head injuries are still in hospital. “Most of the students sustained soft tissue injuries but we managed to stabilise them,” he said. He added that the two students in hospital have already undergone CT scan tests on their heads to establish the extent of the injuries. The students were heading back to their school after attending a career talk at the neighbouring Kosachei Secondary School when the incident occurred at about 3pm. Emergency medical responders first took them to the Turbo Sub-County Hospital but they were transferred to the MTRH in Eldoret for specialised treatment. Turbo Deputy County Commissioner Mohammed Mwabudzo who confirmed the incident attributed it to the ongoing heavy rains in the region. "Heavy rains pounding the region is causing poor visibility. We call on motorists to exercise caution during this season," said Mr Mwabudzo. The accident caused a heavy traffic snarl up along the busy route.
