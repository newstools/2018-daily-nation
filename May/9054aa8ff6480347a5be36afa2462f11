The Ministry of Industry, Investment and Trade has opposed the creation of a special category of membership in co-operatives for impact investors. Co-operatives Development principal secretary Ali Noor Ismail said the proposal will effectively create a parallel class, which is in conflict with the basic principles of the co-operative movement in Kenya. “The new class will have more powers and more authority and more votes,” said Mr Ismail yesterday in Nairobi during the opening of Stima Sacco’s city centre branch. The changes are proposed in the Co-operative Societies Act and the Sacco Societies Act by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, 2018. Besides the special voting rights, they also seek to exempt members from paying membership fees imposed on ordinary co-operative members. Mr Ishmail said the ministry had given a submission opposing the new class of membership to the speaker of the National Assembly. “We are now waiting to be called for an opportunity to go and outline the issues that we see are in conflict with the co-operative movement principles,” said Mr Ismail. The bill limits the voting powers of impact members to specific resolutions, maintenance and operation of the special funds, remuneration of the special fund trustee and similar affairs. However, ordinary members are not allowed to vote on matters reserved for the impact investors. The Co-operative Alliance of Kenya), an umbrella lobby for 15 million co-operative members, and the Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Co-operatives have also opposed the proposed amendments.
