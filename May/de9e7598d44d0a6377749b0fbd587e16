The battle for the Sh2.7 billion political parties funds for Jubilee and ODM has now moved to Parliament. The Sh2.7 billion is 0.3 per cent of the national revenue collected last year, following a court ruling in October 2017 directing that Section 24 of the Political Parties Act comes into effect in July. In its Budget estimates this year, Treasury has proposed Sh822 million for the fund, way below the 0.3 per cent of revenue requirement, infuriating ODM which had gone to court to compel Parliament to allocate the funds. TERRIBLE SITUATION “It is a terrible situation. We want Parliament to respect its own law,” ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna said. On Tuesday, National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee Chairman William Cheptumo appeared before the House budget team to discuss his group’s proposal on the fund. “We are under an obligation to appropriate the funds required under the Political Parties Act and it is an issue that the government should do,” Mr Cheptumo told the Nation. Under the Act, only Jubilee and ODM qualify for the fund. Already, Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung’u has asked the House to budget for the 0.3 per cent. NUMBER OF VOTES Eighty per cent will be given to the parties based on the total number of votes in the last election, 15 per cent based on the number of candidates in the party from special interest groups, with five per cent going to the Registrar of Political Parties to administer the fund. On Tuesday, Mr Sifuna, who had on Monday met Ms Ndung’u, said the budgeting of the fund was non-negotiable. He said he had reached out to his Jubilee counterpart Raphael Tuju to also whip his members into action. In a case filed before Justice Roselyne Aburili, ODM had argued that following the 2013 election, it was entitled to at least 40 per cent of the fund.   In the 2017/2018 financial year, political parties were allocated Sh371.2 million by Parliament.
