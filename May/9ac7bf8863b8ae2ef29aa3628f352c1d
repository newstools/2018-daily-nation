Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was on Thursday dealt a blow after members of the county assembly rejected two of his nominees for chief officer positions. The assembly rejected  Ms Mary Nyambura and Mr Musa Mohammed as nominees for Finance and Medical Services chief officer’s posts respectively. POSTS This was after the vetting team found the two unsuitable to serve in the said positions. The Finance and Appropriations Committee found Ms Nyambura, who currently works as an account at Kenya Power, unsuitable for the job because of lack of understanding of the department she was nominated to. “ We ask that the Assembly disapproves the nomination of Ms Nyambura for appointment to the position,” said the Committee chair Robert Mbatia. The Health Committee report tabled by chairman Peter Warutere revealed that Mr Mohammed who is the current Mama Lucy Hospital medical superintendent had no interest in the position until he was prevailed upon by the governor.
