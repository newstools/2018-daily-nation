Four members of the Ngirita family in Naivasha have been arrested in ongoing swoop of suspects linked to the Sh9 billion National Youth Service scandal. The four, Ms Ann Wambere Wanjiku Ngirita who was paid Sh59 million for supplying nothing to the NYS, her mother Ms Lucy Wambui, sister Phyllis and brother Gicini are being held at the Naivasha Police Station. The suspects were arrested at their home in Lake View Estate in Naivasha at about 8am and are set to be transferred to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters in Nairobi for grilling. Ms Wambui owns two firms – Waluco and Ngiwaco Investments – which are among 10 companies whose directors were summoned by detectives last week in connection to the NYS scandal. Ms Ann said she mandated her mother to operate one of her bank accounts linked to the scandal. The companies whose directors were summoned by the DCI are Firstling Supplies Ltd, Kalabash Food Supplies, Kunjiwa Enterprise, ArkRoad, Ersatz, Ameri Traders, Jerrycathy, Annwaw, Ngiwaco and Njewanga.   ‘Supplier’ says she does not know where the goods were sourced, their cost and if they were delivered.
