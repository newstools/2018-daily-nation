Kenyatta University has directed students to report back on Monday in order to resume learning. Vice-Chancellor Paul Wainaina said individual lecturers had agreed to resume teaching and therefore students need to be in class. “The university management has made necessary arrangements to ensure continuation of lecturers for the second semester 2017/2018,” said Prof Wainaina. He said members of the academic staff had individually signed a commitment to undertake their teaching duties and students who have been away should report back. Prof Wainaina said Labour Court ruling declaring the strike illegal was clear and therefore should be respected. However, University staff academic staff Union (Uasu) Chapter assistant Secretary Calvin Kayi said the strike will continue and there will be no learning on Monday. “Students should not waste time and money coming back until when the strike is officially called off by Uasu Secretary General,” said Dr Kayi. The government has since set up a team to table a counter-offer to striking lecturers who have been out of class since March1.
