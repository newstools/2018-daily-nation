The Kenyan Premier League on Wednesday won a crucial court case in which it sort to block Football Kenya Federation from interfering with the running of the top flight league. In the ruling that lasted four hours, the Sports Disputes Tribunal (SDT) gave KPL powers to determine whether this weekend's 'Mashemeji' derby pitting eternal rivals Gor Mahia against AFC Leopards will be played. This clash was slated for the Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega on Saturday but come Monday, FKF president Nick Mwendwa ordered the game be rescheduled to allow the two teams release 12 players for national team duty ahead of the international friendlies against Swaziland and Equatorial Guinea. Mwendwa also expressed reservations on whether the facility was secure to host this game, which he classified as a "high risk match". "The (SDT) ruling is objective based on the principle that we have the mandate to run the league and nobody should interfere with that," said KPL's chief executive Jack Oguda. "We don't like it (the ruling)," said Mwendwa. "Two KPL officers in the name of Jack (Oguda) and Frank (Okoth) have hijacked the game. We had hoped they will be sensible but then we have to respect the ruling and so any teams that want to take their players this weekend are free to do so." This development is the latest in a long stand brawl between the two bodies. In a quick rejoinder, KPL late Wednesday evening postponed the derby. "A new date and venue for the match will be communicated next week after consultations with the home team, AFC Leopards SC," read the statement.
