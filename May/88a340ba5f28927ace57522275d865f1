Hi. My boyfriend has been good to me, but lately he has become so boring. He started a new job and right now that is all he talks about. He no longer wants to do fun activities and I feel like I have to beg for his attention. When I ask him he says he does not know what I’m complaining about. That’s unfair, don’t you think?  In relationships, people are supposed to grow together. If he has a new job, it shouldn't necessarily mean that that is all he talks about, or that your relationship should suffer – not without a previous discussion, anyway. There are a couple of methods you could use to have a healthier partnership. 1. You could tell him that it is unfair of him to invalidate your complaint, even if he doesn't agree with it. If you're hurt, what matters is not that he understands it, but that he at least acknowledge it. He doesn't have to get it to do better, as long as it is bothering you. 2. Maybe you could find some sort of activity to do as well (not like a new job, but like a new hobby) so that you don't feel the pinch of his lack of affection as much. See what happens if you kindly tell him that his job sounds great, but could you talk about something else on the occasions where you do hang out, because you value your time with him and don't want to waste it talking about work? Keep the channels of communication open, so that what is important to you is clear, and what he considers important (his work) is also addressed and kept in the mix. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
