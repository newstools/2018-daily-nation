Ailing veteran coach Jan Koops has been detained at Metropolitan Hospital over an unpaid bill of Sh280,000. The septuagenarian Dutchman is appealing for help to clear his bill after undergoing two operations in Nairobi to treat hernia. The former AFC Leopards tactician was due to be discharged on Saturday. The coach, who has settled Sh100,000 of the bill from his pocket, was a technical adviser at Ingwe until February when his contract lapsed and was not renewed by the club. The Dutchman has been in hospital for the last 18 days. Koops, who is claiming Sh2.5 in unpaid dues from AFC Leopards, said part of his intestines were operated on. Those willing to help him can send their contribution through pay bill number 891300, account number 21869 or send money to his mobile number 0701243827. “Fans were all over chanting praises for me when I registered good results and even gave me a Kenyan name ‘Wepukhulu’, but I now want them to come to my rescue and help me leave the hospital,” said Koops, a father of two children. He is credited with turning around the fortunes of Ingwe who were languishing near the relegation zone in 2011 when he took over for his first stint. Ingwe was struggling at the bottom end of the league when he took over guiding them to a top five finish that season and and third the following year. Koops has also coached ex-KPL side Nairobi City Stars and Kolongolo FC.
