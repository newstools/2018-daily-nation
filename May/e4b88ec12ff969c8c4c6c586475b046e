Jubilee Insurance is set to roll out a medical mobile app, JubiCare in Uganda and Tanzania by September. The app, launched in February, will allow clients to access policy data in real-time as well as locate the underwriter’s medical providers. The app has various features including health facility finder and navigator, e-health records, pre-authorisation requests, medical card management services and e-wellness feeds. Jubilee Holdings regional chief executive Julius Kipng’etich said Monday plans were underway for Uganda and Tanzania clients to access the app. “We’re still rolling out the service in those regions and they’ll be able to access their details on the app once integration with the database is fully done,” he said. Lately, the insurer has made substantial investments in the development of the transmission of claims electronically, wider use of biometric identification cards and digital mobile apps and artificial intelligence. The insurer has been reviewing systems and operations, implementing enhanced information technology controls to curb fraud and re-engaging with its key service providers to find new and innovative ways to manage medical fees.
