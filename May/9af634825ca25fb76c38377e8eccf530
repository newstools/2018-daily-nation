Former Roads Cabinet Secretary Michael Kamau has been summoned to appear before the anti-corruption court in Nairobi next week. Mr Kamau on Wednesday failed to appear in court as two former engineers faced charges of abuse of office. Mr Mwangi Maingi and Mr Nicholas Ndungu denied charges relating to a road contract in Bungoma County. The three are accused of aiding the loss of Sh33 million through a change on the design of Kamukuywa-Kaptama-Sirisia road. The two denied and was released on a Sh500,000 cash bail each. The trial will start on July 3, while Mr Kamau will appear in court on May 28. The summons come a day after detectives from the anti-corruption watchdog raided Mr Kamau's Karen home in the capital Nairobi. The crime busters from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) wanted to arrest the former CS but did not find him. They descended on residence in Windy Ridge Estate, along Pepo Lane, on Tuesday morning dawn and camped there for more than four hours. The detectives' mission was not immediately clear but Mr Kamauâ€™s lawyer, Nelson Havi, said they claimed they were acting on "powers from above."   Raid linked to Sh33m tender.
