A voter has moved to court to challenge the nomination of lawyer Miguna Miguna as Nairobi deputy governor. Mr John Waigi Migwi has sued Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and his County Assembly in a case in which the Jubilee party is listed as an interested party. According to Mr Migwi, Mr Miguna does not meet the relevant qualifications for that post. JUBILEE He argues that the opposition activist is not a member of Jubilee. He claims that the Elections Act stipulates that a nominee for the position of deputy governor should not be affiliated to other parties other than those within the Jubilee coalition. "Unless restrained, the county assembly shall proceed with the vetting process thus rendering this matter nugatory," he said through his lawyers from the firm of Waithaka and Associates. Last week, Mr Sonko said that he picked Dr Miguna as his deputy “to deal with cartels”. Mr Sonko said if the county assembly rejects Dr Miguna, he will give another name. He said: “The law does not say you should pick a Jubilee or Nasa member for that position and the spirit of the handshake should not be applied selectively and we are in the process of reconciliation.” The governor said choice for the deputy county boss was driven by forgiveness and need for forging unity for the betterment of Nairobi County and the country at large. He said the political differences he had with Dr Miguna, who was also a candidate in Nairobi gubernatorial contest, are over and it is time to improve the city. Mr Migwi wants an order issued suspending the vetting process of Mr Miguna for the position of Nairobi deputy governor.   A meeting at Serena Hotel, a letter delivered by hand, a cagey Speaker, a slippery governor, and a disgusted electorate. Who’s fooling whom?
