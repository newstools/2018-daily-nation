Two 'drunk' high school students caused drama in Ol Kalou, Nyandarua at an annual walk leading to their arrest by the police. Police first detained the visibly drunk students in a private car for more than two hours after their teacher, who they were allegedly harassing, refused to accompany them to the police station. Nyandarua County Commissioner Boaz Cherutich confirmed the arrest and said the two will appear in court. Mr Cherutich directed the police to identify the trader who sold alcoholic drinks to the minors for prosecution. The two Ol Joro Orok Secondary School students were participating in annual walk organised by the Kenya Red Cross. Police suspect the students sneaked from their group near a building that houses the county government offices and re-joined their colleagues at the Catholic Church grounds. After they re-joined the group, they allegedly started behaving inappropriately towards secondary school girls causing commotion that attracted teachers’ attention. Efforts by teachers to stop their inappropriate behaviour was in vain forcing police to intervene. At the police station, the students claimed they bought the alcoholic drinks from a local supermarket, but there was no footage of them in the outlet’s CCTV recording. “We are trying to establish where they bought the alcohol but they are very stubborn and rude. But we know they mixed the alcohol with a soft drink to eliminate the alcoholic smell,” said a police officer.   The teenagers were arrested at a back-to-school party in Taveta.
