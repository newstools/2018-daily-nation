Public Service and Youth Affairs Principal Secretary Lilian Mbogo Omollo has denied the loss of Sh9 billion at the National Youth Service. She denied the loss when she appeared before National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee on Friday accompanied by her Planning counterpart Julius Muia and immediate former NYS Director-General Richard Ndubai. Mrs Omollo’s said her denial was based on the auditor-general's report for 2016/17 that says that not such money was lost at the NYS. “The loss of Sh9 billion as alleged would mean that NYS is technically closed,” she said. “We spent Sh22.2 billion in 2015/16 on supplies at NYS and Sh2 billion this year.” The PS promised to provide list of companies that have doing business with NYS even as she said most of them were inherited from contracts signed in 2013. She also said NYS officers must take individual responsibility for the huge payments made to the companies.  More follows.
