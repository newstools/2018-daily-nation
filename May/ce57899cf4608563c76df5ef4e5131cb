Poor sporting facilities especially soccer and athletics grounds can be a big threat to sportsmen and women’s careers. The current rains have exposed Kenya’s sorry state of facilities with athletes being forced to seek alternative grounds to avoid injuries. For instance, Athletics Kenya has been forced to use grounds in Kisii, Eldoret, Kakamega and Mombasa for their track and field championships owing to poor grounds at Gusii, Kipchoge Keino, Bukhungu and Mbaraki. Kenya is racing against time to have Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, ready to host Gor Mahia’s CAF Confederation Cup matches. Early this year, Deputy President William Ruto announced the government had pumped in Sh4.5 billion into the renovation and construction of five stadiums, and that four of them including Kasarani and Nyayo were to be ready by April but this has not happened. Kenya would be better off with just one ultra-modern stadium that can host major games than promise of many that never come to materialise. Just how will Kenya be able to successfully bid for World Under-20 Athletics Championships without a proper stadium?
