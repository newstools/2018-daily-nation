Musician Jimmy Gait is arguably one of the biggest gospel artists in the country, having released numerous hit songs, among them “Furi Furi”, “Signature” and “Appointment”. He waltzed into the music scene back in 2009 when he released one of his biggest songs “Muhadhara” that spoke of the vice of young lovers battling the sponsor mentality. But was it a song that was inspired by a personal experience? He quickly declines, saying: “I was just being artistic and wanted to address the vice in the society that I saw most of our youths falling into.” From there, he established his name as one of the most sought-after gospel artistes. THINK POSITIVE But his high flying career took a turn for the worse in 2017 after releasing the song “Yesu ni Sponsor” that was received with backlash from his fans. Kenyans on Twitter posted malicious memes and pictures in reference to the song. “This affected me emotionally. It was very difficult in the beginning because I had never faced anything like that before. I ended up being depressed and I even thought of quitting music because it was a very difficult moment,” says Jimmy Gait. He adds: “But it was also a learning process and I was able to pull myself together and surrounded myself with positive people. I was able to overcome the depression because I have learnt how to deal with it.” That is not all, he broke down during a live interview on NTV as he talked about cyberbullying. “A lot of people just share content online and do not really care how it will affect the other person,” he says.
