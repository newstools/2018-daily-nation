At least 10 foreigners were on Wednesday arrested for working in the country using fake permits. The crackdown entered the third day yesterday as the number of the aliens caught up in a rush to verify their document status increased. An immigration official said those arrested used brokers to acquire the documentation. The official, who did not wish to be named, stated that the receipts produced by those arrested were fake. This made their entire documentation invalid hence they were required to apply for the permit afresh through the right channels. The official said many of the foreigners, some of who run smallscale businesses such as barbershops, came as students especially from neighbouring countries, and settled without acquiring the proper documentation. “That is why the crackdown is essential; to ensure we remain safe within our boundaries,” the official said. The crackdown, which began on Monday and will run for 60 days, targets to weed out illegal foreigners working in the country without proper documents. So far, about 400 foreigners have verified their papers.   Interior CS says move will help get rid of tax evaders and criminals.
