UNITED STATES, Chief Justice David Maraga has arrived in the United States where he is set to officially open the much-anticipated annual Kenya diaspora conference in Dallas, Texas on Friday. Justice Maraga, who will be the keynote speaker during the conference, arrived at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Tuesday and was received by the event organisers, among them the president of Kenya Diaspora Conference David Ogega. “This is historic because we’ve not had a senior government official the calibre of Justice Maraga find time and travel all the way from Kenya to engage with us. The Kenyan diaspora is, therefore, very happy at the opportunity to engage directly with the Chief Justice on a wide range of issues that they care about,” said David Ogega. The 2018 Diaspora Conference is set to be held at The University of Texas at Dallas, 800 West Campbell Rd, Richardson, Texas and has been planned by the Association of Kenyan Diaspora Organizations and Kenyan Women in the US. The annual meet brings together business and religious leaders, educators, scholars, and government officials. Ahead of his trip to the US, Justice Maraga had asked the diaspora to share with him in advance the challenges they faced when dealing with the Judiciary.   In 2012, the Kenya USA Diaspora Sacco was registered after negotiations with the Kenya government.
