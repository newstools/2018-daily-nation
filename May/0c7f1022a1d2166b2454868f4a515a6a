News of the arrest of three suspected terrorists in Nyeri is a welcome reassurance of increasing vigilance across the country to prevent infiltration and possible attacks. With Nairobi, Mombasa and other big towns having stepped up surveillance against terrorist activity, it’s not unusual that these devious individuals could target places that are not as well protected. The security personnel have warned about the possibility of the terrorists taking advantage of the celebrations during the holy month of Ramadhan to launch attacks. COMPLACENCY It’s noteworthy that Muslim clerics have warned about that and given useful tips to the faithful and the law enforcement authorities on how to deal with the threat. Although there has been no incident so far, there is no time for complacency as letting the guard down could be disastrous. The Nyeri security personnel have since secured key installations. POROUS BORDER One of the suspects is said to have sneaked back into the country from lawless Somalia, most likely after a stint with the murderous Al-Shabaab, which kills and maims innocent Kenyans. The alert must be heightened. Though there have been sporadic terrorist incidents in the northeastern region, which shares a largely porous border with Somalia. With the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit specifically dedicated to the war and more resources deployed, the war against Al-Shabaab, we strongly believe, is well on course.
