An expectant woman in labour died at the gate of Gombate Dispensary, Kwale County, in what her family claims is a case of negligence by the facility's management. According to the family, Mrs Subira Hamisi, 30, developed complications last Thursday, prompting them to rush her to Gombate Dispensary, only to be turned away by a watchman on duty. Her mother, Mwanaasha Omar, said they pleaded with the watchman to open the gate but he refused despite her daughter complaining of extreme abdominal pains. LABOUR “They refused to help us despite the fact that my daughter was in labour. We waited for close to two hours in the cold as it was raining before she died,” she said. The mother said that earlier in the day, her daughter visited the facility for a check-up which revealed she would deliver anytime. “What I want is justice for my daughter. She would be alive today had she been attended to,” she said on Monday. However, the head of nurses at facility Mr Omar Mrenje said he was not around during the incident. INVESTIGATIONS Kwale Woman Rep Zuleikha Hassan Juma said investigations must be carried out and should someone be found culpable, action must be taken. Mrs Omar said that after taking Mrs Hamisi's body home, two medical officers asked them for the deceased's for the clinic book, which they were also asked to sign. She said after singing the book as instructed, it was never brought back. “We are not aware of what they wrote on the book,” said Ms Mwanamisi Salim who signed the book. Mrs Mariam Omar wants the watchman, who turned them away, sacked.   Judge directs review of Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act.
