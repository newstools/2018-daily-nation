Solai Boys High School in Nakuru has closed down indefinitely after part of it was flooded when Patel Dam burst on Wednesday night. Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang visited the school on Wednesday afternoon to access the damage caused by the tragedy and found classrooms flooded. He instructed the school administration to send the students home. The PS said the school will remain closed until it is safe for students. At least 33 people have been confirmed dead and hundreds of families displaced following the incident. Rongai police boss Japheth Kioko on Thursday said 33 bodies had been recovered, with search and rescue operation ongoing. There are fears of the toll rising further because "many people" are still unaccounted for, according to local leaders. Residents told the Nation that they heard an "explosion" before water gushed out, sweeping away hundreds of homes in the neighbourhood, including those on the expansive Nyakinyua Farm, which borders the water reservoir.
