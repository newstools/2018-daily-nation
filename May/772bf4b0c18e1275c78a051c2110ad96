He added that 21 bodies are at Nakuru County and Nakuru Level Five Hospital mortuaries while 16 are at the camp. "One remaining person is said to have been seen somewhere in Nakuru Town. We are still trying to trace his whereabouts since he was not around during the tragedy." The death toll now stands at 45. Mr Chimwaga said the government will now focus on assisting the families.
