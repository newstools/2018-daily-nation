Although new Harambee Stars coach Sebastien Migne began his tenure by losing to minnows Swaziland 1-0 on Friday in Machakos, the team should quickly regroup and focus on the major assignment ahead of them. On Monday evening, Migne is expected to lead the team out at the same venue in another build-up match, against Equatorial Guinea. The friendly matches are part of the team’s preparations for their second Group F match of 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Ghana in Nairobi on September 7. Harambee Stars lost to Sierra Leone 2-1 in their first game and must win their subsequent home and away matches against Sierra Leone, Ghana and Ethiopia if they are to make the finals in Cameroon. FIRST QUALIFICATION As the government supports the team’s pursuit of a first qualification to this tournament in 15 years, clubs, the Kenya Premier League and Football Kenya Federation should avoid ruinous squabbles. Quality build-up matches will give players the exposure that they need. However, FKF should consult with clubs and KPL so that no party is inconvenienced. The team needs to train in a conducive atmosphere with proper remuneration for players and managers. Lastly, we urge the fans to support the team by turning up in numbers to cheer them during their matches.
