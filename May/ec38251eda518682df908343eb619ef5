Suspected robbers have shot dead two guards at Nyabigege township in South Mugirango, Kisii County. Residents who pursued the attackers following the Friday morning attack torched one of the two vehicles used by the thugs. Mr Joshua Arongo, a teacher in a nearby primary school, said he heard a loud bang and after a while came out only to find two bodies lying in a pool of blood. “We are sad that innocent people were this morning killed by gun-wielding gangs," said Mr Arongo. Gucha South police boss Moses Kanyi said some of the robbers escaped on foot while the rest used the second vehicle. The robbers were targeting vehicle spare parts from tippers parked near on the shoulder of the Kisii-Migori highway. "We are pursuing the robbers and we call on locals to be patient as we continue with investigations,” said Mr Kanyi. But the locals have decried insecurity in the region blaming police for laxity. Mr Vincent Onduso said apart from vehicle spare parts, robbers have been targeting their shops. In March this year, three guards were killed in similar circumstances at Suneka town. The gangsters made away with vehicle spare parts and dozens of computers in the midnight raid. The gangsters tied the guards up, bundled them into one of the cars parked at a nearby garage and killed them.   They were tied up, bundled into a car and killed, chief says.
