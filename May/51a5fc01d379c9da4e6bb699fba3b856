Sanlam Kenya has rolled out a training programme targeting travel agents as it seeks to increase the uptake of insurance by travellers. It is designed to equip them with skills to help them recommend appropriate insurance covers to clients. Sanlam Kenya said the programme, which will be facilitated by International Air Transport Association (IATA) accredited travel agents will help drive insurance penetration. Head of operations Caroline Laichena said the insurance sector was responding positively. “Today, a client is more likely to buy a travel insurance cover through their travel agent and it remains imperative for companies to play a key role in skills transfer to business partners,” said Ms Laichena. Sanlam travel insurance package, which has an upper limit of up to Sh50 million, provides protection for travellers, their personal belongings as well as many non-refundable trip costs. The package also covers trip cancellation and interruption. It also caters for other services including 24-hour emergency assistance and medical care including repatriation coverage for the insured. Travellers with pre-existing conditions are covered to a tune of Sh3.5 million. On Monday, the insurer in partnership with national carrier Kenya Airways began a travel agents training programme in Mombasa. “Today, discerning clients prefer to place their business with travel agents who can provide an all-under-one- roof solution,” said Kenya Airways area manager Rose Kiseli.
