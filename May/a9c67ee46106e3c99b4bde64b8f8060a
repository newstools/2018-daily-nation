The International Olympic Committee sponsored an Athlete Career Transition Programme over a week ago in Nairobi with close to 50 sports personalities taking part. The workshop, conducted by former Malian international basketballer Kadiatou Tounkara, was the first of its kind since 2015. The objectives of the initiative are good and the outcomes will benefit both active athletes and those nearing retirement from sports. Participants learnt skills such as writing a curriculum vitae to managing their resources, especially finances, besides marketing themselves. SUPPPLEMENT EARNINGS Many Kenyans have conquered the world of sports but have not gone beyond their competition venue, where they are likely to earn more or supplement their earnings. This has been due to lack of knowledge, worsened by an inferior education background. This initiative by the National Olympic Committee of Kenya president Paul Tergat should be supported. It will help athletes to invest and manage their earnings and develop their careers. INVESTMENTS Beneficiaries should reach out to others as it is crucial, especially for athletes who start to earn huge amounts of money when quite young. Sports federations should not wait for the IOC to come up with such initiatives but should bring in experts from various fields to educate our sportsmen and women on investment and other opportunities beyond sports.
