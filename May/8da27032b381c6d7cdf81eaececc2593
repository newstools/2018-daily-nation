The Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Noordin Haji, has said he has sufficient evidence to press charges against suspects arrested Monday in connection with the latest NYS scam. Mr Haji said the list of those to be prosecuted includes 40 public servants, 24 directors and proprietors of business entities. NYS director Richard Ndubai and Public Service and Youth Secretary Lillian Omollo are among those who will be arraigned in court tomorrow. OFFENCES They will be charged with conspiracy to commit an offense of corruption, willful failure to comply with applicable procedures and guidelines on the management of public funds, breach of trust, neglect of official duty, abuse of office, fraudulent acquisition of public property and fraudulent making payments from public revenues, the DPP said. During a press briefing in Nairobi, Mr Haji said the investigations were about Sh8 billion pending bills paid by PS Omollo. Mr Haji, who on Sunday received the first batch of files containing conclusions by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations on 10 companies in the Sh9 billion fraudulent payment scandal at NYS, said the team will scan each pending bill. The process might see more companies and individuals put under probe, and possibly prosecuted. The team will include accountants, auditors, information technology experts, and sleuths from the DCI and the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission. “We want to look at everything and anything about NYS, and ask: ‘Is it the system that is the problem?’ We do not want to leave any room for another scandal,” Mr Haji said. “This will be a bigger team comprising more experts. We want to look at these things thoroughly. We want it to be an in-depth and holistic approach; not just skimming at the top.”   A brief summary of suspects arrested in connection to Sh9 billion NYS scandal.
