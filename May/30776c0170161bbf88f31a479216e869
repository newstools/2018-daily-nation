There is not a shadow of doubt that great strides have been made in enhancing delivery of justice by expanding the Judiciary. Many Kenyans no longer have to travel hundreds of kilometres to the nearest court. Indeed, the presence of the Judiciary is felt right across all the 47 counties — evidence of the government’s commitment to enhancing justice countrywide. However, the mere expansion of the physical facilities is not a guarantee that people who seek justice can access it. Indeed, the most dramatic confirmation of this is the protest by lawyers on Monday that paralysed business at the Eldoret Law Courts. SHORTAGE The lawyers were angry about a shortage of magistrates and judges, which, naturally, hampers their work and clients’ access to justice. The aggrieved lawyers saw no other way to catch the attention of the Judicial Service Commission than picketing. As the saying goes, desperate situations call for desperate measures. This would explain why the 200 lawyers locked the High Court, disrupting business. JUDGES TRANSFERRED They claim that three High Court judges transferred two months ago are yet to be replaced while there is a backlog of more than 4,000 cases. But this is not peculiar to Eldoret. There are many more around the country. We hope Chief Justice David Maraga and the JSC will move expeditiously to engage the protesting lawyers to end the siege as they address the concerns raised.
