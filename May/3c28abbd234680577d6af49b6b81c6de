Hi Brenda. I’m saved and often go for the youth service. Men in the group often ask themselves out to lunch to my house…they will say something like: “Si you invite me to your house for lunch?” and I’m always like “No!”. Of course I always give a polite excuse but what really bothers me is that the last time a guy came over, they just came empty-handed and expected me to feed and clean after them. My pal tells me I’m too strict and that is why I’m still single but me I think it is just a breed of men these days who want to be pampered when when they have done nothing to deserve it. Do you agree? I completely and absolutely agree. Being single is not the same thing as being desperate. You do not have to accept the empty-handedness of ill mannered boys who don't have the decency to come to someone's house with something in the hand. Your friend telling you this, is she single? And does she think marriage is the be all end all of life? News flash – it isn't. You don't have to debase yourself so that some guy can feel like he's the man. If he's acting like this when you're barely even acquaintances, much less dating, you think it's going to get any better once it is official? *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? E-mail: lifeanstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I have been in an on and off relationship with him.
