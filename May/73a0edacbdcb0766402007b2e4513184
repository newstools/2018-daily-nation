An official with the registrar of companies this week distanced himself from signatures in two documents alleged to have been forged by lawyer Guy Elms Spencer in a disputed Sh500 million property. Mr Silas Ngatia told Justice John Onyego that he was in charge of registering companies and has records of execution of certificate. “I know my signatures. The only genuine signature is the one on certificate of incorporation,” Mr Ngatia told court. CONTENTS Mr Spencer’s lawyer, asked if he has ever changed names as the signature in question was allegedly appended by one Langat. Mr Ngatia denied having two names. The second witness, Hannah Nyokabi, failed to confirm whether the alleged signatures were hers. Ms Nyokabi told the court that the signatures looked like hers but she could not confirm the contents of the documents. The judge said he was finding it difficult dealing with Ms Nyokabi who was not sure of everything tabled before court. FORGED “I direct that the matter be adjourned to July 17, to give the witness more time,” Justice Onyego ordered. The dispute involves two parcels of land, one located in Upper Hill, and another in Karen. Mr Spencer is accused of forging signatures and a will Roger Robson (now deceased), the owner of the properties. During the last hearing, Chief Inspector of Police Susan Wanjiru, a  forensic examiner, claimed all documents produced for examination in the case had forged signatures.   A judge has stopped a businesswoman from interfering with a Sh600 million piece of land in Karen, Nairobi, until a suit to determine ownership is heard.
