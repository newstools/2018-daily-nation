Headteachers’ associations have been warned against negotiating labour issues on behalf of teachers. Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary-General Wilson Sossion has warned the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association (Kessha) and the Kenya Primary School Headteachers Association (Kepsha) against making any deals with the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) on the workers’ welfare. Speaking at Agoro Sare Secondary School in Homa Bay County, Mr Sossion accused Kepsha and Kessha of endorsing the transfer of teachers. TRANSFER TEACHERS “Kepsha and Kessha should not indulge in negotiating labour matters on behalf of teachers. This is the role of trade unions,” said Mr Sossion, who graced the annual general meeting of Knut’s Rachuonyo branch. He said the decision to support the transfer of teachers was made by a few leaders of the headteachers’ association rather than the majority of teachers who were affected. Mr Sossion said the teachers’ unions represent the interests of both Kepsha and Kessha members. He accused the associations of sabotaging unions’ efforts to fight for teachers’ rights. Teachers will never recognise negotiations made by Kepsha and Kessha on labour matters, he said. “Let Kepsha and Kessha stop undertaking activities which are not within their mandate. We don’t want confusion in advocating teachers’ rights,” he added. DANGEROUS POLICIES The secretary-general accused the TSC and the Education ministry of coercing the headteachers’ associations into accepting policies which are dangerous to the teachers’ wellbeing. Mr Sossion said they were planning to sue the two associations for forcing teachers to accept the transfers. He was accompanied by Knut National Executive Council Nyanza Representative Collins Oyuu, Homa Bay County Knut Chairman Patrick Were and Rachuonyo branch Executive Secretary Eliud Ombori.   A section of the National Executive Committee members want to swear in Mr Hesbon Otieno as new secretary general.
