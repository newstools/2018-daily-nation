The government will reduce the cost of training in technical institutions by 50 per cent. Technical and Vocational Training Principal Secretary Kevit Desai said the cost of technical education has barred many young people from acquiring skills in such institutions. “We are working on reducing the cost of training. Young people can now access funds from Higher Education Loans Board to register for the courses,” he said. Dr Desai, who spoke in Nairobi when he opened a three-day workshop hosted by the Canadian government on improving education in technical institutions, stressed the need to focus on competence based programmes. COMPETENCE-BASED PROGRAMMES The Kenya government has partnered with the Canadian government to strengthen and roll out competence based programmes in technical institutions. Ten polytechnics, among them Kabete, Eldoret, Kitale, Kisumu, Kisii, Sigalagala, Nyeri, Meru, Northern Eastern and Kenya Coast, are in the programme. The five-year project started in 2016 and is expected to end in 2021. DEVELOP SKILLS It is expected to increase employment opportunities for over 1,200 trainees who will have the necessary skills in entrepreneurship, agriculture and energy sectors. Kenya Education for Employment Programme officer Sharon Eshuchi said the initiative will develop skills in  agriculture and energy sectors as well as ensuring that youths access quality and relevant training to prepare them for the job market.
