ODM leader Raila Odinga has said a team will be established to end corruption in the country. Speaking at Mungatsi Primary School in Nambale, Busia County, on Saturday, Mr Odinga also said the claims that he has been silent on the recent scandals are untrue. "We are still constituting an elaborate team that will handle this vice," he said. He added that the peace deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta will facilitate uniform growth among Kenyans. He was attending the funeral of Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya's mother-in-law Margaret Shiundu Oruma. SCAMS The government has been hit by several scandals. At the National Youth Service (NYS), Sh9 billion is reported to have been siphoned through payments to fake companies. And two other debacles (maize and subsidised fertiliser) are rocking the Agriculture ministry headed by Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri. The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB), which is under the Agriculture ministry, is claimed to have lost subsidised fertiliser worth Sh6.3 billion through underhand dealings. It has also come under fire after revelations that the ministry's staff were involved in hoarding fertiliser and frustrating farmersâ€™ efforts to get payment for maize supplied to the NCPB. Mr Newton Terer resigned as NCPB managing director, and Public Service Principal Secretary Lillian Omollo has been questioned concerning the NYS matter.   Mr Kuria said he does not support the idea because it will benefit only a few people.
