A new rule requiring newly hired primary school teachers to commit to serve in the county where they are first posted for at least five years sounds punitive. While the objective may be desirable, its implementation is fraught with challenges. It is merely a knee-jerk reaction to the outflow of teachers from insecurity-prone areas, especially North-Eastern region. Teachers Service Commission announced the rules this week in the wake of an exodus of upcountry teachers from Garissa, Wajir and Mandera counties fearing for their lives due to frequent bandit and terrorist attacks. GENUINE REASONS It would be unreasonable to tie down a teacher to a region where they live in perpetual fear of getting ambushed and killed. Besides, it is counterproductive because such teachers would be least productive. The commission should instead consider individual cases on merit and be ready to transfer teachers with genuine reasons to other work stations. The reasons could range from health problems due to weather patterns, insecurity and even hostility from local communities. LAWLESSNESS The government ought to crack down on lawlessness in North-Eastern to make it conducive for productive work by all Kenyans. Teachers, like the rest of civil servants, should be ready to serve in any part of the country. However, it is unfair to impose a policy that is restrictive and insensitive to the practical realities of the day.
