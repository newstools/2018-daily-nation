The Kitale-Lodwar road was on Thursday closed at Kainuk as the Kenya National Highway Authority rushed to repair Kainuk Bridge. On Thursday, all motorists were barred from using the road as the agency reinforced the bridge. The bridge will be used by trucks transporting oil to Mombasa from Lokichar, Turkana County. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to flag off the trucking under the Early Oil Pilot Scheme on Sunday despite the lack of a dependable bridge. FLOODS Heavy trucks had been proscribed from using the bridge since it was repaired after it collapsed last year. A temporary drift was later constructed for them at Kainuk. That drift has however been unusable for the last two months after it was overtopped by River Malmalite's flood waters. Turkana County Commissioner Seif Matata said that normal traffic will have resumed by Sunday before the trucks are flagged off. PROGRESS Petroleum and Mining Cabinet Secretary John Munyes said he was satisfied with the progress of the repairs. "I applaud the relentless works of the officers from the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Defence. They are working day and night to ensure the bridge is complete ahead of the flag off on June 3," he said during his visit to the area. He added: "I would like to assure Kenyans that the bridge will be completed for our oil to be transported to the port of Mombasa."   Transportation is supposed to begin on June 3, but road has been cut off by floods.
