The Sh437 million city centre security camera project is a failure, a county assembly committee has said. According to a Nairobi County Assembly Public Accounts Committee report, 26 of the 42 CCTV cameras on Moi Avenue, Uhuru Highway, Kenyatta Avenue, Tom Mboya Street and other major roads are broken down. The report, tabled by the committee chairman Wilfred Odalo early this month, shows the cameras cannot be relied on to enhance security for Nairobians. PUBLIC MONEY “As observed by the auditor-general, the project has been a failure despite the colossal amounts of public money spent,” the 2015/16 auditor-general’s report said. It also revealed that no information has been provided on action taken to obtain the requisite equipment, previously reported as lacking. “It has not been clarified whether the cameras are capable of detecting car number plates. The surveillance system may still not be relied on for security,” the PAC report reads. The Integrated Urban Surveillance System project was initiated and implemented by the Ministry of Nairobi Metropolitan. The contract was awarded to Nanjing Les Information Technology Ltd in 2012. It entailed the installation of cameras and associated software, new traffic management systems and construction of a nerve centre. A Nairobi County Transport and Public Works officer said City Hall is not to blame, adding that maintenance is being handled by the contractor. He said the project is yet to be handed over to the devolved government by the Ministry of Transport.
