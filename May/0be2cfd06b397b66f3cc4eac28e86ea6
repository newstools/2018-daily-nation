Hi Brenda, I have been in an on and off relationship with my baby daddy, mostly because he cheats on me. He then repents/ asks me to forgive him. I take him back, then it happens all over again. I know you will ask me to leave if I ask you. What do you think?  Of course I will ask you to leave but I will also realise it is futile because clearly you enjoy the thrill of being cheated on. Must be exciting, knowing that you're sharing your man with some random chick out there. There was that female MP the other day who said polygamy was the way forward, so you're doing a great job. Thumbs up. Sarcasm aside, you're also clearly not ready to leave this guy, which is why you're still there. Either that, or you don't value yourself at this moment to walk away and not accept his apologies. The thing is, he's going to keep doing it until he gets tired or someone gets sick. I hope for you and your baby's sake that you don't have to get to that point. ***  Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
