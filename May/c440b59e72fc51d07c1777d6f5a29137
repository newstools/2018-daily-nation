The hooligans who attacked a businessman at a Nairobi hotel on Monday to prevent him from issuing a press statement must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. It’s a shame that security personnel did not immediately go to the victim’s rescue and arrest his assailants for the heinous crime. Governor Mike Sonko, on whose behalf the goons purported to be acting, must come clean on this issue. It is important that he confirms to the city residents that he does not condone such crude behaviour and help the police to identify and arrest those bullies. CONSTITUTION Whether or not the man was going to criticise the county leadership or praise it is immaterial. By manhandling and preventing him from addressing the media, the crooks violated cardinal freedoms enshrined in our Constitution. They have absolutely no right to deny anyone his freedom of expression and association. The hotel is a public place and he had every right to be there. As a Nairobi resident, he has a stake in this city and has a right to voice his opinions on any matter. CRIMINAL Ours is a civilised society, where people can go wherever they wish so long as they do not breach any law. Allowing goons to violently prevent residents from commenting on the state of affairs in the city is criminal. Unless they are punished, the incident is likely to set a bad precedent with brutal attacks becoming more prevalent.
