The monthly report also indicates that in April, the imported volumes went down to 12,071 tonnes from 25,845 tonnes in a similar period last year.

The country imported 981,000 tonnes of sugar between May and December last year as the Treasury opened the duty-free window to allow traders to ship in the commodity outside Comesa to bridge the local deficit. The directorate said the number of traders seeking import permits had gone down in recent months because of high volume of sugar in the country. The Treasury scrapped duty on the commodity last year following a sharp decline in production that saw the price go up to Sh400 per two-kilo packet. Kenya produces about 600,000 tonnes of sugar a year, compared with annual consumption of 870,000 tonnes. ALSO READ: Uhuru deal set to raise cost of imported goods
