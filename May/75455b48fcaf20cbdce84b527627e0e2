A total of 80 incidents of terrorism were recorded in the country in the last one year leading to the deaths of 82 people while 118 were seriously injured. The government identified and proscribed 105 organised criminal gangs across the country in the same period. REFUGEES A report by the government on national security further reveals the influx of refugees in the country is posing various security challenges which include recruitment into terrorism, radicalisation, and proliferation of small arms and light weapons. These details are contained in the Annual Report on the State of National Security President Uhuru Kenyatta submitted to Parliament when he delivered his State of the Nation address to Parliament on Wednesday. “Some criminal elements have infiltrated boda boda business particularly in urban settings, taking advantage of the versatility of this mode of transport,” it states, while noting that security officers have contained the gangs. The report, which was co-authored by 27 government agencies, warns that the rising use of computer applications in every aspect of life has increasingly exposed individuals and organisations to cyber threats and cyber related crimes. “The dynamic nature of technology and lack of adequate cybercrime legislation amid thriving growth of the ICT sector make the country susceptible to local and international cyber threats.” According to the report, the government has taken measures to address refugee related challenges include the state taking over refugee status determination and is in the process of taking over the handling of the database and the process from UNCHR.   Nearly 3,000 attacks were reported in the continent in the past 12 months.
