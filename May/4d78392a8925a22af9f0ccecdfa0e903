Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) detectives are grilling a magistrate based in Malindi over an allegation he received Sh25,000 bribe to influence the outcome of a case. The detectives raided the office of Senior Resident Magistrate Corilus Nyawiri at Malindi Law Courts and arrested two other people suspected to have allegedly bribed the judicial officer. Sources at the EACC told the Nation that the magistrate was arrested and later flown to the anti-graft’s Nairobi headquarters at Integrity Centre for interrogation and arraignment. On Thursday, the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association (KMJA) secretary general Derrick Kuto wrote a letter to the EACC demanding to know Mr Nyawiri's whereabouts. In the letter, the KMJA say they have reports that the magistrate has gone missing and he may have been held by EACC officers. “The purpose of this letter is to request your good office to confirm if indeed the magistrate is being held by your officers and if this is the position, what action is expected to be taken against him,” states the May 24 letter. However, according to a document seen by the Nation, a senior military officer had filed complaints with the EACC, Chief Justice David Maraga and Judicial Service Commission complaining over the conduct of the magistrate. The military officer alleged the magistrate may have been compromised by a complainant to influence the outcome of a case.
