The dam that collapsed in Nakuru is owned by Patel Mansukul, a prominent large-scale irrigation farmer who owns an expansive farm in Solai. Mr Mansukul owns the Patel Coffee Estates Limited which deals in large-scale coffee, macadamia and dairy farming as well as beef cattle production. He has constructed seven dams on his nearly 6,000 acres of land. In 2015,one of the dams burst its banks but no fatalities were reported. Mr Mansukul has been practicing farming in the area for nearly two decades.   George Wanjala, 25, a father of three, said he heard a bang but before he could find out what was going on, the water was already filling his house. Wanjala, who could not hold back his tears, said he could not save any of his children, including a two-month-old baby.
