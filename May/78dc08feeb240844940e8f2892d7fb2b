The Lit360 show has since its launch created a buzz on social media leading to Kenyans sharing various videos of themselves while singing or dancing. One of the artistes featured on the show and whose comprehensive interview can also be found on the website www.lit360.africa is rapper Wangechi. She started her high-flying music career five years ago when she dazzled Kenyans with her vocals and rap lyrics. Wangechi first released her  mixtape “Consume - Chakula ya soul” in July the same year. And on December 2, 2016 she released her 10 track EP “Don’t Consume if Seal is Broken”. However, she became a household name after she was featured in the song Ligi Soo by rapper King Kaka and other artistes. “I am thankful to the producer who took me in and helped me nurture my God-given talent. He helped me with my first recorded mixtape,” she said. But her journey was interrupted in 2017 when she was involved in a car accident in which she lost her best friend who was in the car with her. “I had internal bleeding, I broke my left hand and had a brain injury that left me unable to walk for two months. I also broke my nose and jaw,” said Wangechi. She added: “It took a month to move from ICU and another month at home before going back for another surgery, and a further four months to get back to a condition that would allow me to go back to school.” After recovering she went back to school, graduating from Strathmore University with a degree in Financial Economics. One of the latest songs that she released in April this year is Used to it. “Right now I am fully focused on my music. I am planning on releasing an album,” she said. Wangechi said one of the biggest challenges she faces is getting recognised. “It is easy for a guy to be recognised as a rapper but not so for female rappers,” she said.   They want to be an all-girl Kenyan group that will stand the test of time.
