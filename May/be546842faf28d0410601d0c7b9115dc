Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has returned to the city as road repairs in the capital continue. Mr Sonko on Sunday toured various estates to oversee ongoing road repairs. The governor has been operating from his Mua Hills home in Machakos County since his security detail was scaled down. "Our focus is to have functional infrastructure in Nairobi. We will be able to reduce the chaotic traffic congestion within Nairobi," Mr Sonko said in a statement sent to newsrooms by deputy director of communication Elkana Jacob. Starting Monday, buses will be allowed into the central business district at intervals to reduce congestion. ROADS The county is repairing Ukwala Lane, Matopeni Road in Kayole, Gwasi, Sheikh Karume and Kilome Roads. Also, the construction of Railways Bus Terminal is ongoing. "I am appealing for patience from Nairobi residents as we strive to fix the dilapidated roads in Nairobi even as we wait for the financial year in order to cover all areas that are in need of our attention," he said. Others in the city centre set for revamp are Redile and Wakulima Roads, Mfangano Street, Mfangano Lane, Nkuruma Lane and Monrovia Lane. With regards to garbage collection, county executive in charge of Devolution Veska Kangogo said the frequency of garbage collection has increased. "The devolution department, through the local MCAs, has identified 20 youth in each ward who will be responsible for cleaning and collecting garbage," Ms Kagongo said. She said that in the next 100 days, 2,500 tonnes of garbage will be removed per day, up from the current 2,000 tonnes.   The county wants to decongest the city centre.
