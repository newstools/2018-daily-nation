One person has died and two others are receiving treatment after they were involved in an accident in Tharaka-Nithi County. The incident occured after the lorry driver lost control an fell into a ditch near Kirimankari Primary School on Monday evening. The driver's body was taken to Chuka County Referral Hospital mortuary while the injured are being treated at Kajuki health centre. Principal Simon Maingi said part of the Chuka-Kaare road is under construction. "According to eyewitness, the driver was speeding when the accident happened," Mr Maingi said. Ms Susan Muthoni, a resident, said the contractor should be held accountable for failing to erect temporary bumps or mounting road signs. "Any driver using this road for the first time can think the entire section of the road from Kaare to Kajuki markets has been tarmacked," Ms Muthoni said.
