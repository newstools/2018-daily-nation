Leaders of workers unions Sunday strongly  condemned  the death threats to Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary- General Francis Atwoli, a day after the he claimed that his life was in danger. They called on the  Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinett to increase Mr Atwoli’s security detail with immediate effect. Led by Kenya Plantations and Agriculture Workers Union (KPAWU) assistant secretary-general Meshack Khisa, the leaders said: “It is clear that someone somewhere feels threatened by Mr Atwoli’s recent calls to amend the Constitution and adopt the Bomas Draft model and it is highly likely this is the person behind the plans to eliminate him.” “The IG must improve brother Atwoli’s security, or else we will ask workers to come out and provide security for him,”  Mr Khisa said. CARTEL The unionists claimed that only  a person who will lose if the Constitution is amended and the presidential  powers are trimmed will threatened by the call to workers to protest if Mr Atwoli’s security is not tightened. They claimed that a faction of politicians not to be pleased with Mr Atwoli’s recent political stand is also planning to get him out of the National Social Security Fund board of national trustees. KPAWU deputy secretary general Thomas Kipkemboi said the people planning to eliminate Mr Atwoli were those who are barred by the Cotu boss from stealing workers NSSF money by the virtue of him sitting at the NSSF’s board of trustees. “He has been defending workers NSSF money since it was Sh20 million to now when it is over Sh220 billion. We feel the threats are related to the scheme to remove Mr Atwoli and the Federation of Kenya Employers chairperson Jacqueline Mugo from the board so that the cartel can steal the money,” Mr Kipkemboi said.
