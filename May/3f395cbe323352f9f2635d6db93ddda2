Fingerprint and facial details were also collected. COMPETENCE Mr Lawrence Mwangangi, the Public Service Committee member, told Nation the exercise will help them account for their employees.

PricewaterhouseCoopers is carrying out the audit. Aside from reducing the wage bill, the recommendations will help deal with competency issues.
