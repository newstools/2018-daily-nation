A social worker at a rescue centre in Kitale was on Tuesday sentenced to life imprisonment for defiling two minors who were under his care. Elkana Ndiema Cherokee was found guilty of two counts of defilement and committing an indecent act on minors at by the Kitale Resident Magistrate Grace Sitati. He was accused that on diverse dates between September 1, 2016 and September 22, 2016 he defiled the girls aged 10 and 16 at the centre. ASSAULT Medical records presented in court indicated that the victims had their hymens torn and were old looking indicating they had been sexually assaulted. In her testimony in court, the first girl said on one of the days between the established period the accused called her in the office around lunch time and forced himself into her. The second minor also testified that the accused defiled her around lunch time on a different day at his office. She said Mr Cherokee gave her Sh50 after act, but denied that he had threatened her. Mr Cherokee denied the charges and told the court that he had been framed. He presented three witnesses, officers at the centre, who all accused the minors of making up the accusations. DEFENCE The court dismissed the defence saying that the minors were consistent in cross examination. She explained that it would have been difficult to coach the minors since they had nothing to stand against the accused. “The accused was known to them as a teacher. Their testimonies before me struck me with truthfulness. I have no doubt in my mind that the accused person defiled the two minors as he was working at the centre,” the court said. The convict has 14 days to appeal.
