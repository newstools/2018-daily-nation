Nine soldiers have been injured after two Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) trucks collided in Hurara, Tana River County. County Red Cross Coordinator Gerald Bombe on Monday said five soldiers are receiving treatment at a medical camp in Manda, Lamu County, while four others are admitted to Malindi Sub-County Hospital. Mr Bombe said two soldiers are in critical condition. "The truck behind hit the truck ahead from behind. The five soldiers in the truck that was trailing incurred minor injuries while two had deep cuts and the other two suffered serious injuries," he said. This happens to be the second accident at the same spot, barely a week after a van carrying Catholic church officials knocked down a motorcycle rider carrying two pillion passengers. The motorcycle rider and one passenger died while receiving treatment at Garsen Hospital, while the other was taken to Malindi Sub-County Hospital in critical condition.
