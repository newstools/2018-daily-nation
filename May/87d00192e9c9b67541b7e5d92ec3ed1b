The two main suspects behind a spate of criminal activities in Mt Elgon were on Thursday charged in Bungoma. Mr Timothy Kiptanui Kitai alias Cheparkach and his young brother Cleophas Ngeywo Kitai alias 'Jet Li' appeared before Bungoma Principal Magistrate Gabriel Omondi where they denied all the charges. The duo was charged with more than 100 counts of murder, rape and robbery with violence. Mr Kiptanui is believed to have formed the gang to help him avenge the burning of his house on January 17, 2017 by residents who had been fed up with his criminal activities. CURFEW Mr Kiptanui surrendered to police in Eldoret town on May 14, 2018 while his brother, who is said to be the deputy, did the same in Kericho a week later. Police had offered Sh1 million for information that will lead to the arrest of Mr Kitai. The two join several others accused of terrorising residents at the start of the year. On March 6, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i imposed a 90-day curfew in the region to protect innocent civilians and flush out the gang members. REMAND Tens of people were killed by the gang. The prosecution had requested the court to deny them bail because they had skipped court in 2015 in a case that was later terminated. The suspects will remain in police custody as they wait for the hearing of their case on July 3.   Alex Juma is said to have been arrested in Uganda while on the run.
