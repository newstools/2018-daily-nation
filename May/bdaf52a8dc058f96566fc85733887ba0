Home pro John Wangai shot one under par 71 to tie at the top with round one leader Justus Madoya as the second leg of the "Road to Karen" golf series came to an end at Sigona Golf Club on Wednesday. Wangai birdied the ninth and 15th with the day’s only bogey at the eighth for an all rounds total of three under par 213. “We decided since it's a qualifying event, there will be no play off, otherwise, it was a good round it would have been better if I didn’t drop a shot at the eighth," said Wangai. Madoya, from the Great Rift Valley Resort in Naivasha, picked up three birdies but dropped an equally number of shots for level par 72 to also wind up on three under par 213. “My game is very good as I am getting lots of fairways, I must thank my home club for pushing me to do a lot of practise. I now have confidence of playing under par score," said Madoya. Finishing in third place was the first leg winner Erick Ooko of Royal Nairobi Golf Club who picked up a double bogey at the 17th, having bogeyed the fifth, 11th, 12th and 15th earlier. Ooko, who is however exempted from qualifying, managed only two birdies at the ninth and at the 18th for four over par 76 which left him on level par total of 216. “I dropped so many shots with the worst one being at the 17th where I pulled my driver to the left, then took the wrong club for the approach shot," said Ooko, who now leads the series Order of Merit. The day’s best round of two under par 70 was posted by Thika Sports Club’s Simon Ngige and another Sigona player Sujan Shah to finish in fourth and seventh places respectively. Ngige’s round included six birdies on the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, 12th and 13th but against four bogeys over the seventh, 10th, 14th and 16th to finish on one over par total of 217. The third leg of the five-event series will take place at Muthaiga Golf Club from June 11-13 before action shifts to Karen Country Club which is the venue for the Karen Masters.
