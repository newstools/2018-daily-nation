An appeal against Mandera Governor Ali Roba has been withdrawn by his competitor in the last general elections, Hassan Noor Hassan. Mr Hassan, who lost in the gubernatorial race against the Mr Roba, requested to have the matter withdrawn in a notice to the Court of Appeal registrar. Through Prof Tom Ojienda & Associates Advocates, Mr Hassan wrote to the Registrar of Court of Appeal on May 10, seeking to have the matter withdrawn. GOODWILL “We showed up for the hearing of the case but it was withdrawn by Justices William Ouko, Milton Makhandia and Kathurima M’Inoti,” said Adan Kullow, Governor Ali Roba’s legal adviser. Mr Kullow said the decision by Mr Hassan showed political goodwill and it will allow Mr Roba to concentrate on service delivery in Mandera. “This has been a reconciliation process that has involved all stakeholders including Garre Council of Elders and the two political competitors but finally it has been settled,” he said. ELDERS DECREE Mr Hassan who enjoyed the powerful council of elders’ support in the last general elections lost to Governor Roba. He launched a petition against the win at the High Court in Nairobi but lost, forcing him to move to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was withdrawn with no orders as to costs before the three Court of Appeal judges, according to Mr Kullow. GARRE SUB-CLANS Several phone calls to Mr Hassan, a former provincial administrator and now Chief Administrative Secretary at the Ministry of Sports, went unanswered. Governor Roba is said to be in Denmark for official duties. Mr Roba dismissed a decree by Garre Council of Elders asking him to step down for Mr Hassan in the spirit of negotiated democracy which allows rotational holding of political offices among the Garre sub-clans.
