Isuzu East Africa has re-entered the passenger car market with the Isuzu mu-X, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) which it has priced at Sh6.6 million. The company in 2017 exited the passenger car segment after its Chevrolet franchise was terminated by Detroit-based General Motors, which also sold its entire 57.7 per cent stake in the dealer to Japan’s Isuzu Motors. The transaction led to a rebrand of the dealer which previously traded as General Motors East Africa (GMEA). The company is betting on the seven-seater SUV to gain a presence in the passenger car market which it was previously represented by models such as the Chevrolet Trailblazer. “We are delighted to introduce the Isuzu mu-X to the SUV market. This is a vehicle designed for the urban lifestyle professional and people who love travel and adventure,” Rita Kavashe, Isuzu’s chief executive said in a statement. Sellers of new SUVs in the country include DT Dobie (Jeep and Mercedes) and Toyota Kenya which is the leader in the segment with a greater variety of its namesake models. The Isuzu mu-X has a 5-speed automatic transmission. ALSO READ: Sales reports key to carmarkers marketing plan
