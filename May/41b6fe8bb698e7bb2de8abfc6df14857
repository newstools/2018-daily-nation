LAUSANNE The investigation into a 1.8-million-euro ($2 million, Sh200 million) payment to former Uefa president Michel Platini "is not completely over", Swiss prosecutors said on Saturday, after his lawyer said he had been cleared. Platini could still be required to appear before a judge if new evidence is found in the case that led to him being banned from football for eight years, later reduced to four, a spokesman for Switzerland's public prosecutor's office told AFP.   Platini told AFP he hoped that Fifa would have "the decency" to lift his suspension.
