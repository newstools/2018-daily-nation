The head teacher of Kamatungu Primary School in Tharaka was on Monday evening rushed to Tharaka Sub-County Hospital after he was bitten by snake. Mr David Gitonga Nthenge was leaving an evening class when he accidentally stepped on the reptile that bit him on the leg. The incident comes barely three weeks after a Standard Six pupil at the school died of a snake bite while receiving treatment in the same hospital. Tharaka-Nithi County health executive Gichuiya Nthuraku said cases of snake bites are on the rise in the region. He said since December last year, 22 cases had been recorded. FUMIGATE Mr James Murauko, a parent, has called on the government to fumigate the nearby bushes to keep off the reptiles. “Our children and their teachers are at risk because there seems to be an increase in the number of snakes in the area,” said Mr Murauko. Lucy Kagendo, another parent, wants Kenya Wildlife Service to take responsibility and foot hospital bills and compensate the victims. “Many people have died and others left with severe injuries because of snake bites and it’s high time KWS took responsibility,” said Ms Kagendo.
