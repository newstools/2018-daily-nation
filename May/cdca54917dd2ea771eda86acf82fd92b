The 14-member team of advisers to oversee the implementation of the deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga met for the first time on Thursday, signalling the start of a process that might see far-reaching changes to the Constitution. Mr Odinga has pegged the success of the March 9 deal on the amendment of the Constitution to restructure the presidency, as well as introduce a third tier of devolution to bring in 14 regions to oversee the distribution of resources to the 47 counties. The team, selected two weeks ago, and which has a secretariat manned by lawyer Paul Mwangi for Mr Odinga and Martin Kimani for President Kenyatta, had lunch with Mr Odinga at a Nairobi hotel. LAUNCHA statement from the conveners said Mr Odinga spoke to the team about the expectations he and Mr Kenyatta have of them. They are expected to establish the modalities for executing the nine-point plan in the communique released by Mr Odinga and Mr Kenyatta on March 9, the statement added. “Mr Odinga said the advisory team will design a programme that allows them to listen closely to the wisdom and concerns of their fellow citizens,” Mr Odinga said after the meeting. “The retreat will be followed by an official launch of the programme by Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga.” The team was formed following the historic March 9 handshake between the two leaders on the steps of Harambee House. The two, in the nine-point agenda, agreed to address ethnic antagonism, lack of national ethos, inclusivity, strengthening devolution, ending divisive elections, ensuring safety and security of Kenyans, ending corruption and ensuring shared prosperity.   Opposition leader says current laws cannot support the intentions of his truce with President Kenyatta.
