Kenyans Emmanuel Korir and Caroline Chepkoech turned on the style to win their respective races in Doha, the opening leg of the 2018 Diamond League Series on Friday. Korir hit the front with 300m to go before holding off World 1,500m champion Elijah Manangoi to win the men’s 800m race. Chepkoech, the 2011 Africa Under-20 5,000m champion, made a strong return to track to win the women’s 3,000m, stunning the likes of World and Commonwealth 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri. Korir, who is based in USA, put behind the misfortunes of failing to compete at the World Indoor Championships in March to win in season’s best 1 minute, 45.21 seconds. Manangoi, who is fresh from winning the Commonwealth 1,500m gold last month in Gold Coast, Australia, cruised to second place in a personal best of 1:45.60. Manangoi is using the two-lap race for speed and endurance ahead of his 1,500m specialty. Nicholas Kipkoech from Kenya came in third place also in a season’s best of 1:46.51 with 2015 and 2017 World 800m silver medallist Adam Kszczot timing 1:46.70 for fourth place. ROTICH FIFTH Ferguson Rotich and World 800m bronze medallist Kipyegon Bett all from Kenya finished fifth and 10th in 1:46.76 and 1:48.32 respectively. “It was a good race though slow,” said Korir, who kept his options of taking part in the National trials for the Africa Championships in July open. “Everything is possible so long as you’re ready for it,” said Korir. Korir said he does believe in himself and that he will aim higher this season. “We still have a long way to go but I must accomplish something soon,” said Korir, who failed to go past the semi-finals at the 2017 World Championships with a back injury. Chepkoech, clocked a personal best of 8:29.05 to beat World 10,00m bronze medallist Agnes Tirop just on the line in also a personal best of 8:29.09. Chepkoech, who missed the majority of the 2014 and 2015 seasons, returned with a tour of races in the United States in 2016 before pacing at the 2017 London Marathon. The 2016 Rio Olympics 3,000m silver medallist Hyvin Kiyeng sealed a Kenyan 1-2-3 sweep in 8:30.51. Obiri finished 14th in 8:53.65. In other races, Kenya’s World Under-18 1,500m champion George Manangoi chalked a personal best of 3:35.53 to finish second behind Ethiopian Taresa Tolosa in the men’s 1,500m. Tolosa overtook leader Bethwell Birgen from Kenya at the last bend before stepping on his gas pedals with Manangoi in pursuit to win the race in a season’s best 3:35.07. Despite losing to Tolosa, who is the 2016 World Under-20 1,500m silver medallist, it was a good race from Manangoi considering that it was his first Diamond League race. YEGO STRUGGLES AGAIN Another Kenyan youngster Justus Soget settled third in a season’s best of 3:35.71 followed by compatriots Charles Simotwo in 3:36.40 and Birgen in 3:36.54. Kenyans Lawrence Kipsang and Emmanuel Kiprono lost the men’s 3,000m steeplechase battle to Africa champion Ethiopian Chala Beyo. Beyo took off just before the bell to win in a season’s best of 8:13.71, beating Kipsang and Kiprono, who claimed their personal best times of 8:15.07 and 8:16.24 respectively. Former World javelin champion Julius Yego finished a disappointing eighth in a season's best of 80.75m. Germany's 2016 Olympic Champion Thomas Rohler (91.78m, SB) led compatriots Johannes Vetter (91.56m) and Andreas Hofmann (90.08, SB) in a sweep of the podium places at the Suhaim bin Hamad Stadium. India's Commonwealth Games gold medallist Neeraj Chopra was fourth in a new national record of 87.43m.   With 200m to go Semenya moved effortlessly up on Jepkosgei's shoulder.
