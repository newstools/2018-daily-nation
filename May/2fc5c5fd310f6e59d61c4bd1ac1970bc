Horticulture fair set for june The annual International Floriculture Trade Fair (IFTEX), will this year feature Fresh Produce Africa (FPA) exhibition, a new fair designed to focus exclusively on the specific needs of the Kenyan fresh produce sector.The exhibition which will run from June 6 to 8 at the Oshwal Centre in Nairobi, will showcase the country’s potential in fresh produce production and hence attract more growers to the sector, according to Dick van Raamsdonk, the general director of HPP International Exhibitions Group, the events’ organisers.“The FPA exhibition basically targets to bring the global consumers of fresh produce to the products’ producers (growers), and in effect give them the insight into how these crops are produced,” said Mr van Raamsdonk.According to him, the flower industry has even more competition compared to fresh produce sector, in the Kenyan context, the more reason why growers should venture more into the business of growing fresh produce. “For a long time, the flower industry has overshadowed fresh produce in many aspects. This exhibition will thus strive to uplift the status of other fresh produces such as vegetables, herbs, fruits such as avocados and even tubers,” he said.– Brian Okinda
