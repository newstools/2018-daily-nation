MILAN Maurizio Sarri's departure as Napoli coach was confirmed Wednesday by club president Aurelio De Laurentiis hours after Carlo Ancelotti agreed to take over. "I'd like to thank Maurizio Sarri for his valuable contribution to the Napoli cause," De Laurentiis said in a brief Twitter message. "He brought joy and prestige to Naples and Napoli fans all over the world with an entertaining brand of football that drew praise from all quarters. Well done, Maurizio â€” Aurelio De Laurentiis." Sarri, 59, who led Napoli to second in Serie A behind Juventus this season, has been linked with a move to both Chelsea and Zenit Saint Petersburg. The Russian club have been without a coach since Roberto Mancini returned to take over the Italian national team. Sarri joined Napoli three years ago and had been under contract until 2020.   It would mark his first job in Italian football since leaving AC Milan in 2009.
