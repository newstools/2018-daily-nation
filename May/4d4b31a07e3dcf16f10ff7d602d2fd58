The tussle witnessed this week between Kenya Premier League Limited, the company that runs the local Premier League, and Football Kenya Federation (FKF) over friendly matches involving clubs and the national soccer team is not healthy. FKF postponed the match between Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards that was to be played in Kakamega today to allow the clubs to provide players for the national football teamâ€™s friendly matches against Swaziland on Friday and on Monday against Equatorial Guinea. KPL argued that the Harambee Stars matches were not part of Fifa-recognised international friendlies. The battle between KPL and FKF revives the animosity between the two bodies on who is in charge of running soccer in the country. Already FKF have indicated that they will run the league from 2020. The local soccer scene witnessed enough of these wrangles that saw KPL and FKF battle on whether 18 or 16 teams should be in the league. Such cases can be avoided if both FKF and KPL harmonised soccer activities in the country.
