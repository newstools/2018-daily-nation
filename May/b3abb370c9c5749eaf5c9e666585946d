Seventeen chiefs in Central region have been interdicted for misconduct, regional commissioner Wilson Njega has confirmed. Mr Njega said some of those interdicted have been colluding with illicit brewers while others have been consuming the brew. Three of the chiefs are from Nyeri, three from Kiambu, seven from Nyandarua and four from Muranga. The administrator said some of them have been tipping off brewers of planned operations to help them escape arrest. He was speaking at Chaka, Nyeri on Saturday where more than 900 litres of illicit brew was destroyed. Mr Njega said more than 100,000 litres of illicit brew has so far been destroyed since the crackdown began. Njega promised instant promotion for chiefs who have completely wiped the illegal substance in their jurisdictions. The administrator said 345 people have so far been arrested and charged with contravening the law. He said the crackdown will continue despite ending of the 100-days rapid resource initiative.
