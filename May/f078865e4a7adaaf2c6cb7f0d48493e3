Members of Parliament  have summoned former Transport Permanent Secretary Nduva Muli and former Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) Managing Director Lucy Mbugua over huge variations in costs for the expansion of terminal 4A and other works at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The two are expected to explain why the cost of building the terminal and other works increased from the initial price of Sh4.7 billion to Sh6.19 billion and later to Sh7.2 billion. The building of terminal 4A was completed in 2014 and the electric works completed in July 2017. National Assembly Public Investments Committee members also demanded that those who sat in the tender committee that approved the variations appear before them with a proper explanation. The committee, chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, termed the variations illegal and misuse of taxpayers’ money. Mr Nassir called on the current management to trace all those that sat in the tender committee so they could appear before the MPs to answer to the audit queries. “We need a proper breakdown on the cost variations with explanations backed by documentary evidence. The variation is high and getting a loan does not mean the law has to be set aside,” Mr Nassir said. AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT Mr Nassir made the remarks on Tuesday when the team met the management of KAA over the Auditor-General’s report for the 2012/2013 financial year. “I have a strong feeling that there are games being played here over cost variations,” Mr Nassir said. He said the variation of the cost has become a burden to the current management who are still servicing the loan. KAA Managing Director Jonny Andersen told the MPs that the variation was approved by World Bank which gave a loan for the construction of the terminal.
