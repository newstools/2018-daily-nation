Tharaka-Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki has accused health workers at Marimanti Level 4 Hospital of laxity following the death of a snake bite victim almost 24 hours after admission. He vowed to assist the family of the Standard Six pupil seek legal redress Speaking at Kanganta RTU Church, Prof Kindiki said the county government, hospital management and health workers who were on duty must be held responsible for the death of Faith Makena, 12. “I will pay a lawyer to help the  family sue the county government if it is willing to pursue justice for their daughter, who died in unclear circumstances,” said Prof Kindiki. The girl was taken to the hospital and died the following day. Her death sparked a public outcry, with residents wondering why she was not transferred to another hospital if there was no anti-snake venom serum at that facility. Makena’s brother, Mr Jonathan Bahati, said he was denied a chance to transfer his sister to another hospital after nurses insisted that she was responding well to treatment. The senator said it was wrong for the girl to be buried without a postmortem being conducted despite questions having been raised by her family and residents over the death. He faulted the county leadership for remaining silent on the matter and even failing to attend the burial that was held last Friday at Kamutungu. “I don’t know why no action has been taken on the health officers who were handling the girl up to now,” he said. But Health Executive Gichuiya Nthuraku denied the laxity accusation against health officers who handled the victim. “The victim died while being attended to,” said Dr Nthuraku.
