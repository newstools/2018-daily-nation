Whenever parents see off their children as they go to colleges and universities away from them, the expectation is that they will be safe and will work hard and eventually graduate. If they ever suspected that their children were going into harm’s way, there would be a lot of resistance. However, the information coming out of the campuses of the various universities paints a shocking picture. The young, innocent and determined fellows on leaving their homes are increasingly coming face to face with deadly challenges. Worse are the deaths that have been reported in various institutions. In a report published on Saturday, the Saturday Nation chronicled some of the fatal incidents and other grave occurrences in recent days. DENS OF DEATH What are meant to be centres of excellence are turning out to be just facades, behind which many young people find themselves in dens of death and destruction. Away from home, many of the young people find themselves with boundless freedom, as their parents’ prying eyes are largely missing. They get sucked into alcoholism, illicit love affairs and other anti-social behaviour that hamper their academic development. Some have been recruited into armed gangs and used in armed robberies, risking their lives. TERRORISM In recent years, with the spectre of terrorism hovering over the country, many have become increasingly vulnerable to radicalisation. Some students have been killed by police or by their lovers, and the increasing incidence of crimes targeting university and college students is a source of national concern. There is an urgent need to stop the killings on campuses and in other conflicts. Universities have security mechanisms but these appear inadequate against the massive challenges. This is a serious crisis that calls for serious efforts to enhance the safety of students.
