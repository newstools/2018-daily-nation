The issuance of work permits to foreigners is always an emotive matter. And it’s easy to see why. A country that hires foreigners, especially amid acute unemployment, is seen as betraying its own citizens by denying them opportunities. Interior Cabinet Secretary  Fred Matiang’i’s criticism of employers hiring foreigners for jobs Kenyans can do resonates with the public. The minister, who told off a contractor, was, in fact, just restating the official policy. He found a foreigner supervising a construction site and asked why such a role should not have been given to a Kenyan. REVOKE PERMITS However, foreigners do not obtain the documents by themselves. They are issued by government officials, who must, surely, be conversant with the policy. They must be held to account. And if the permits are found to have been fraudulently issued, they must be revoked, the culpable officials punished and the jobs given to Kenyans. SKILLED ARTISANS However, where the country needs skills that cannot be found locally, it makes sense to issue work permits to foreigners. The plain truth, though, is that there are very few such rare skills, which Kenyans do not have. A good example would be the highly skilled artisans on the standard gauge railway or technicians for the nascent oil industry. But overall, it’s unfair to deny qualified Kenyans jobs and give them to foreigners.
