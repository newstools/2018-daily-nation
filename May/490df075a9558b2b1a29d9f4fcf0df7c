Developers eyeing government-fronted contracts on low-cost housing projects have been warned against using unapproved alternative building technologies. Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) managing director Charles Ongwae said while they’ve has allowed use of new alternative technologies to fast-track building of housing units, these must adhere to laid-down standards and regulations. “For any new technology you have to seek approval and we shall swiftly act on it enabling Kenyans to enjoy lower building costs. Some of the technologies approved include use of burnt bricks, compressed soil blocks, EPS wall panels and prefabricated iron sheet panels,” he said. Speaking in Nairobi, Mr Ongwae said the transition from the current British Standard Building Code to Eurocode was underway. A national Implementation Committee on Eurocode (Nice) has since been constituted tasked with formulating a curriculum to be used in training built-environment professionals at youth polytechnics, technical colleges and universities. Under the government-fronted housing projects, 500,000 affordable houses are slated for construction in different parts of the country especially in major towns to alleviate housing challenges blamed for proliferation of slums. The government has since invited firms to bid for implementation of the project with greater emphasis placed on use of alternative technologies that could see them deliver houses faster. In the first lot, Nairobi’s Starehe A and B, Muguga Green, Shauri Moyo (A,B,C,D) Makongeni and Mavoko totalling 36,840 housing units are set for ground-breaking this year.
