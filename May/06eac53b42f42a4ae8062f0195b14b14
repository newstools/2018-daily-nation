LOS ANGELES The Cleveland Cavaliers will be without forward Kevin Love for game seven of the NBA Eastern Conference finals against Boston on Sunday after the forward was placed in the league's concussion protocol. The Cavs and Celtics will be battling to determine who will represent the East in the NBA Finals. Love exited the Cavs' game-six win over the Celtics on Friday in the first quarter after a clash of heads with Boston's Jayson Tatum. Love, the Cavs' second-leading scorer and top rebounder, fell to the court and had to be helped to the sideline. After he was evaluated in the locker room, the team said at halftime that as a precaution he wouldn't return to the game. "Kevin Love was evaluated today prior to the team's flight to Boston this afternoon," the Cavs said in a statement on Saturday. "He is experiencing concussion-like symptoms and has been placed in the league's concussion protocol. "He is now listed as out for tomorrow night's game in Boston. His status will be updated as appropriate." Love has been sidelined by concussions before, including in the 2016 NBA Finals and for a March 28 game at Charlotte this season.
