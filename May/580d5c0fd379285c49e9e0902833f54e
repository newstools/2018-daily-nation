The first phase of the Sh11 billion Dongo Kundu bypass will be opened for public use by next week, the government says. Plans to construct the second and third phase, which will connect the north and south coast, are under way. "Motorists will be allowed to use the roads in the first phase by next week. The works are now complete and we want to officially hand it over to the public," KeNHA's Coast Regional Director Jared Makori said on Monday. The bypass is expected to decongest the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. It runs from Mombasa Portâ€™s second container terminal and links the highway at Bonje, near Mazeras. The work started in July 2016.   ECONOMYThe Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) says the two phases will cost Sh30 billion and work will start by July. The project is also aimed at easing transport within Mombasa County, boost industrial development and reduce transportation cost. Mr Makori said the road will boost confidence among investors in the hospitality industry who have complained about poor transport. "They were shying away from putting their money in an area faced with serious transport problems," he observed. It will also provide an alternative to the busy Likoni channel, which has been afflicted by frequent breakdown of ferries. TRAFFIC Motorists are in most occasions delayed at the channel due to traffic snarl-ups. At least 320,000 people and more than 6,000 vehicles use the Likoni channel daily. In phase two, an 8.9 km road between Mwache Junction and Mteza will be built while the third phase will see the construction of a 6.9km road between Mteza and Kibundani, linking the highway to the Likoni-Lunga Lunga Road; where there will be an interchange. Further, two bridges will be constructed: one at Mwache (900 metres long) and another at Mteza (1.4km long). A sightseeing bay will also be build and 88 hectares of mangroves will be replanted.
