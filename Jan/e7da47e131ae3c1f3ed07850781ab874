Philip Arunga and his son Omwakwe on Sunday starred for Mombasa Island Cargo Terminal (MICT) as they lifted the Chairmanâ€™s Cup after beating Royal Salute 5-4 in the final at the Nairobi Polo Club. MICT successfully defended the title that they won in January last year after beating Royal Salute and Samsung. The MICT team was made up of Nairobi Polo Club chairman Arunga (2). Omwakwe (0.5), Karim Abbany (-1) and Magda Jurkoweicka (-2), while the Royal Salute quartet was composed of captain Jamie Hayward (0.5), Anthony Wahome (0), Kevin Kaniu (0) and Natasha Tisminiesky (0.5). Arunga led from the front, sweeping in three goals in the match as the young Omwakwe accounted for the other two goals. Teenage sensation Natasha Tisminiesky, who has just returned from Argentina where she undertook professional polo lessons, scored three goals for Royal Salute while Anthony Wahome complemented her efforts with a goal in the fourth chukka. Just like in their semi-final match against Samurai on Saturday, Royal Salute started strongly and were one goal up by the third minute of the first chukka, but they failed to maintain the tempo against MICT whose greatest strength was their sturdy horses owned by Arunga. Omwakwe equalized for MICT just two minutes later before his dad swept in a brilliant spot shot with his strong backhand to ensure his team ended the first chukka on top. The second chukka was a balanced and subdued affair.
