Activist Okiya Omtatah has moved to court to challenge the appointment of chief administrative secretaries and principal secretaries. Mr Omtatah has sued President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Public Service Commission (PSC), the Attorney-General and the Speaker of the National Assembly over the recent Cabinet appointments by President Uhuru Kenyatta. UNLAWFUL The activist accuses the President and PSC of violating the law, which he argues stipulates that no person may claim or exercise state authority except as authorised under the Constitution. He said the chief administrative secretary position was created without public participation. Mr Omtatah also argues that the country's wage bill was ballooning hence, the matter is of grave concern due to the costs of running new offices of the chief administrative secretary post in all ministries. HAND-PICKED He further faults the President for hand-picking people without subjecting them to a merit-based competitive recruitment. "I verily believe that in regard to the continuing violation of the law, it is of utmost importance and urgency that such be stopped," said Mr Omtatah. He wants the creation of the position of chief administrative secretary in all ministries be temporarily suspended. The activist also wants the appointment of chief administrative secretaries and principal secretaries suspended on grounds that they were hand-picked and appointed without being recommended by the Public Service Commission.   He questions the constitutionality of conducting the repeat presidential election.
