The government has in the past three years distributed about six million mathematics textbooks to public primary schools across the country. This is according to the Ministry of Education’s director of programmes Elyas Abdi, who said the textbooks had benefited 2.8 million children in Standard One and Two. PROJECT Mr Abdi was speaking on the sidelines of a workshop to review the progress made in the implementation of the Kenya Primary Education Development Project (PRIEDE) in a Naivasha Hotel. The workshop participants comprised of regional coordinators of education, county directors of education, district accountants and county project coordinators from across the country. “About 100,000 teachers in class one to three have also benefited from training, which aimed at imparting new methodologies of early grade mathematics instruction through improved in-service training and regular pedagogical supervision and support,” he said. The numeracy initiative is being conducted under the PRIEDE project, which is being undertaken by the Ministry of Education. GRANT This follows a grant of Sh8.84 billion from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). The four-year project, which is in its third year, is under the supervision of the World Bank. It seeks to address challenges in early grade mathematics education. Mr Abdi said the implementation of the PRIEDE project had led to improved numeracy skills and influenced government policy on the model of textbooks to schools. “The government in conjunction with World Bank, is in the process of implementing Sh20 billion Secondary Education Quality Project (SEQIP), to ensure the provision of quality secondary education experience for learners in 30 counties, which will cover 110 sub-Counties in the targeted counties,” he said. Mr Abdi said the investments in education aimed, at among others, to improve learning outcomes and get people who can drive Vision 2030 and the future stability and prosperity of the country.
