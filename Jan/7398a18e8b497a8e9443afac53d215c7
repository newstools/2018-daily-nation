Veteran politician and former Homa Bay Kanu stalwart, Elisha Aketch Chieng’, 75, has urged politicians and other well-wishers not to wait until he is dead to give “nice condolence messages” instead of helping him improve his deteriorating health. He was peaking to journalists at his Homa Bay Town home on Tuesday. Mr Chieng’, who was in 2016 elected the national patron of former councillors’ caucus in Nairobi, suffered stroke and is currently bed-ridden. He served as a councillor between 1969 and 1992 where he also held the position of chairman of the larger South Nyanza County Council (now Homa Bay and Migori Counties) and Kanu vice chairman in the region. BED-RIDDEN “I am bedridden and poor. I call on my fellow politicians, NGOs and other well-wishers to come to my aid now when I am still alive. Please, I am suffering, don’t wait until I die to give nice condolence messages at my funeral,” said Mr Chieng’. Mr Chieng’, known for his stunning stage crafts, narrated how he fell ill in 2012 after slipping and falling down, consequently developing complications that led to a surgery. SUFFERED STROKE “I have moved to more than 12 hospitals. I also suffered a stroke in November 2016 and spent more than Sh3 million. I am now left a poor man. Most of my allies no longer pick my calls and only left me to die,” added Mr Chieng’. He was one of the most charismatic and vocal politicians in South Nyanza during former President Daniel arap Moi’s era. He also worked for former Ugandan President Milton Obote before President Jomo Kenyatta invited him back to the Country. Mr Chieng’ unsuccessfully vied for the Ndhiwa parliamentary seat in 1997 and lost to former Internal Security Assistant Minister Orwa Ojode.
