A sports federations governance seminar ended in Nairobi last weekend with National Olympic of Kenya (Nock) affirming its commitment to good management practices. Nock president Paul Tergat observed that the seminar was the first step in an effort to encourage consultations in the running of the association for the better of sport going forward. The seminar that centred on integrity, accountability, competence, duality and autonomy and presided over by the National Olympic of Uganda secretary general Donald Rukare, brought together Kenyan national federations. Numerous observations were made and recommendations arrived at. “We have realised that governance can make or break an institution,” said Tergat. “Where there is a bad governance structure, definitely the institution will fail.” Tergat said that they will ensure that at the end of their term, they will have inculcated the culture if accountability in federations to enable them give the country’s sportsmen and women the best service. “As managers and leaders, we want to make sure that there is openness in everything we do unlike in the past. Even at the international level, accountability is crucial since we have to account for everything we get in terms of money,” he observed. Tergat added that most of the issues discussed during the seminar will be institutionalised, with many more on the way. “The era of having one meeting in a year (Annual General Meeting) is gone and we are going to see to it that we meet our members at least three times in a year to discuss any emerging issue,” added Tergat.
