Entries for Sunday's Britam Kenya Guineas, are: Bulawayo, Busselton, Clothes Horse, Free Wheeler, Navy Seal, Risque, White Dragon, Winter Comet, and, X-Factor. It is a well known fact, that Patsy Sercombe's yard has the best two-year-olds to date. Choosing between them is tricky, but, we have an inkling that Free Wheeler could be worth considering. He has done everything right since inception. Entertainment from Parachutists, Marching Bands, Food Courts, and Children's amusements, are on tap to create a devastatingly cordial ambiance on January 21, 2018 at Ngong Racecourse, Nairobi. JOCKEY'S CHALLENGE Dinesh Sooful, representing Mauritius, Deon Sampson - South Africa, Brendon McNaughton - Zimbabwe, and, Richard Kibet - Kenya, have already participated in this fascinating Jockey's Challenge, before. It is such a draw, there is no way our public can afford to miss any part of it.  You will not even allow the afternoon to end. *** Meanwhile, Frankie Dettori is to spend spend some time in sunny Florida ahead of the G1 Pegasus World Cup January 27. Dettori, who partners Toast Of New York, might also pair up with several horses for trainer Wesley Ward, a few days leading up to the Big Race. SUCCESSFUL YEAR Toast Of New York, 7, had his most successful year at age three, when winning the G2 UAE Derby, and was a close second in both G1 Breeders' Cup/Pacific Classics. Toast had been retired to stud in Qatar, but was seen to still have remarkable abilities, so, Jamie Osborne took him on. First time out, he snipped a condition race at Lingfield. Of course, he has to contend with the exceptional Gun Runner (Florence Geroux), who has been stretching his legs with Gettysburg in colder New Orleans. Gun Runner, trained by Steve Asmussen, is ante post favourite for the $16,000 second edition of Pegasus.   There will be an international jockeys competition on January 21, 2018.
