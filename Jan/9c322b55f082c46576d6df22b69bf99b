Newly appointed Gor Mahia captain Harun Shakava is optimistic of leading the club to its first title of the year this weekend. K’Ogalo, who are the reigning Kenyan Premier League champions, will face arch rivals and GOtv Shield holders in the season opening KPL Super Cup at the Afraha Stadium in Nakuru on Sunday. The league body have meanwhile announced the match will be produced by Spanish multi-communications group MediaPro, and broadcast live on KTN. “We are aiming for an improved campaign in all competitions this season,” said Shakava during the official launch of the fixture in Nairobi. Shakava has taken over the captain’s arm band from the Musa Mohammed, who gone to look for more fame and fortune in Albania with second tier side KF Tirana. Added Shakava: “This includes qualifying to play in the group stages of the (Caf Africa) Champions League. Against Leopards, we know we will win if we play well. It will improve our confidence if we win the Cup on Sunday.” Similarly, soft spoken Leopards captain Duncan Otieno was bullish about their Super Cup’s expectations while addressing the media. “The coaches have brought in some very exciting youngsters plus experienced foreign players. We will take the game to them, try and compete, and then hope for the best,” said Otieno, who starred for Kenya during the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup last December. Speaking at the same function, Gor Mahia coach Dylan Kerr urged the government to resolve its row with gaming firms “once and for all”. Both Gor and Leopards are currently operating with a collective Sh105 million hole in their annual budgets following the abrupt withdrawal of SportPesa as their shirt sponsor at the start of this year.   This was KCCA’s third game in their Kenyan tour.
