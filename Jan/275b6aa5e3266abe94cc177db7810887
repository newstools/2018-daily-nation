There is a good reason to be skeptical of Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett’s assurance that the fears of a looming food shortage are unfounded as there is enough maize to last till the next harvest. Reports about increases in food prices are a good indicator that there are not enough stocks. CS Bett says a 2kg packet of maize flour should retail at not more than Sh115. But that is easier said than done. Millers are warning that the price could rise to Sh200. Even if the government enforces that price, with maize in high demand, it is unlikely that those holding the limited stocks will comply. The solution is, of course, to fully supply the market and the prices will go down. DROUGHT Food is always a sensitive matter, hence the need to be truthful about any shortcomings or hitches in supply. During last year’s prolonged drought, the government intervened by importing maize, which was meant to be sold to consumers at a heavily subsidised price of Sh90 per 2kg packet. But that appears to have been a drop in the ocean as many places did not receive the flour. Instead of accusing millers of exploiting consumers, the minister should ensure that there is enough maize. The pledge to release two million bags from the strategic reserve should be speeded up. Alternatively, offer higher prices and mop up maize from farmers. The last resort is quick imports and judicious distribution.
