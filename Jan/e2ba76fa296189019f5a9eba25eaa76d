Police reforms were at the centre of clamour for a new constitution in the 1990s. Then, the force had been turned into an appendage of the Executive and routinely used to beat the opposition into submission. In respect to this, the call was for an independent police service that acted professionally and was totally insulated from politics and Executive’s intrusion. The objective was clearly achieved when the draft Constitution was enacted in 2010. It created an independent police agency, changing its name from “Force” to “Service”, and giving its leadership security of tenure. Concomitant to this, it provided for competitive appointment of the top leaders— again to parry off political influence as was the case in the past. Against this backdrop, questions are being asked about the recent appointment of two Deputy Inspector Generals of Police and the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. NIMINATED MEMBERS The three were named by President Uhuru Kenyatta a fortnight ago as he partially nominated members of the Cabinet. Subsequently, the National Police Service Commission quickly processed the appointments within a few days and had them sworn-in on Friday. This raised many questions. The police commission should ordinarily advertise for the top positions when they become vacant, interview the candidates publicly and present names to the President for appointment. Every stage must be transparent and participatory. It is not done the other way as was the case here, where the whole process was mired in secrecy.  We must guard against practices that undermine independence of institutions and denigrate the law.
