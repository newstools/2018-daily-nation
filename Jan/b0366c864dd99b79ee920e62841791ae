A mob lynched and burned three men in Siaya County on Tuesday on suspicion that they were part of a notorious gang in Siaya. The men were attacked at Malunga Village in West Gem. LYNCHED Hillary Oyuga, Bruce Choka and Jacob Opiyo were accused of being part of a gang that has been terrorising residents in Malunga, as well as passengers and motorists using the busy Kisumu-Siaya highway. Mr Meshack Odongo, a resident, said angry residents conducted a manhunt and seized the three. “We have witnessed a lot of robberies and hijackings in the area at night and we suspected that the vices were being committed by some of the youths in the society,” Mr Odongo said. “We have been forced to take the matter into our hands as the police have done nothing despite us reporting to them.” EX-CONVICTS Area assistant chief Barrack Opondo said that some of the suspects had just been released from jail and they have been attacking residents using crude weapons. Mr Opondo added that in the manhunt, the residents found assorted valuables and electronics believed to have been stolen from their neighbours and people from other regions. He said that the residents retaliated because a gang attacked and seriously injured people who were partying in the village. They are recuperating at Ng’iya Mission Hospital. Siaya County Police Commandant Sarah Duncan confirmed the incident and said her team was investigating the matter. CRIME Ms Duncan urged residents to present suspected criminals to the police for appropriate action to be taken against them. “We call upon the residents to report crime to the police,” she said. Mrs Duncan said suspects could help in investigations and in arresting other criminals. The bodies of the deceased were taken to Siaya County Referral Hospital.
