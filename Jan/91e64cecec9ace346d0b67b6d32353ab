A chief, her assistant and three members of Nyumba Kumi initiative have been charged in a Nanyuki court with the murder of a suspected chang’aa dealer. The five have been in police custody for a month due to legal hitches that made taking of the murder plea postponed three times. When they appeared before Lady Justice Mary Kasango on Monday, they denied murdering Wachira Kabui on October 31 last year at Ichuga village, Nyeri County. The accused include Gakawa Chief Lucy Wanja, Equator Assistant Chief Getrude Koki, Nyumba Kumi initiative members Loyford Mwirigi, George Wachira and Mary Nyambura. The suspects applied to be released on bond pending trial, an application that the prosecution did not oppose. “The accused are respected leaders of Gakawa location, we are applying that the court releases them on favourable terms and if possible release them on cash bail so that they can join their families today,” their lawyer William Bonwonga told the court. The prosecution asked the court to caution the administrators and their supporters against issuing threats to witnesses. Lady Justice Kasango ordered that the five remain in custody until Wednesday when the court will deliver a ruling on whether to release them on bond.
