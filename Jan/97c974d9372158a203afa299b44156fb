Presbyterian University of East Africa which was shut down last week over failure to meet guidelines has appealed the decision. Vice-Chancellor John Mungania termed the decision harsh and expressed confidence that it will be lifted to allow the institution to continue with its programmes. “Learning is going on as we engage the government on the revocation of the decision. We have already met the Commission for University Education (CUE), Education ministry and Kenya University and Colleges Central Placement Service among others,” said Prof Mungania. The ministry revoked the university’s letter of interim authority with effect from January 23. Then acting Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i also authorised CUE to initiate the process of winding up the university. The decision followed the recommendations made by the CUE. CUEA The CUE report had also said Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA) did not have adequate financial resources since as at September 12, 2017, the university owed creditors Sh1.5 billion. The report also said the university violated rules on teaching hours. CUEA Vice-Chancellor Justus Mbae has said the institution is implementing a turnaround strategy that involves restructuring and rationalisation of its administration staff and other resources aimed at ensuring sound financial operations. “The university’s board of trustees (BoT) and council are actively involved in implementing this turnaround strategy. This includes BoT’s approval and direction with regard to bailing out the university to ensure the debt-burden, arising from infrastructural investments, is reduced to manageable levels,” he said. Kenya Private Universities Workers Union Secretary-General Peter Owiti said poor management was to blame for the woes affecting the institutions. “There is need to separate the running of the church from managing a university. We also need the right people,” said Mr Owiti.
