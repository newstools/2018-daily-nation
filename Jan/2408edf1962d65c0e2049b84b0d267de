Muhoroni Youth has said it will fight on to remain in the Kenyan Premier League, just hours after losing a petition to be reinstated. On Monday, Kisumu High Court Judge David Majanja dismissed Muhoroniâ€™s application, ruling that the team has not proven adequately that its relegation from the Kenyan Premier League was grounded on unreasonable rules and standards of football. The judge also ruled that granting Muhoroni a return to the league, previously known as SportPesa Premier League, will be of great inconvenience to the Kenyan Premier League and new clubs that were promoted, since the teams were not represented in the case, and have been preparing for the new season, with fixtures already out.
