Two touts working for Marimba Investments Sacco have been charged with murdering a motorist on Christmas eve in Zimmerman Estate in Nairobi County. However, Mr George Irungu Maina and Mr Ian Mbugua were not required to plead to the charge when they appeared before Lady Justice Jessie Lesiit because they did not have a lawyer to defend them. Before the arrest and charging of the two, the killing of the motorist had caused hue and cry from various quarters, with calls that action be taken against Marimba Sacco whose bus crew had attacked the motorist. Justice Lesiit Wednesday informed the two that the purpose of their appearance in court was to be informed of the nature of case filed against them by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP). OTHER SUSPECTS AT LARGE The two are accused of murdering Joseph Ng’ethe Kiarie in Zimmerman Estate in Nairobi’s Kasarani Sub-County jointly with others who are yet to be arrested. Police are pursuing the other suspects. The judge also informed the two that they also appeared before her in order to establish whether they were financially able to engage a lawyer on their own to defend them or whether they would like the State to hire one for them. The two suspects said they will not afford to hire a lawyer. As a result, the judge ordered they be remanded at the Industrial Area prison until January 24, 2018 when the State will provide them with a lawyer. They will also be required to plead to the charge. A state prosecutor informed the judge that the accused have been subjected to mental examination and they “have been certified as being fit to stand trial”.   The angry matatu crew beat Mr Kiarie and left him lying on the road.
