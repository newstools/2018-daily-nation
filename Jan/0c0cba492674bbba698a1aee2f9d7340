Police are investigating the circumstances under which a University of Nairobi student died at the Mamlaka A Hostel early Sunday. The fourth year student, Ian Kibet Kimaiyo, fell from the third floor of the hostel and was found dead a few minutes past midnight. Police said a security officer, Titus Awuor, reported to them that the student had fallen from the third floor but he was not certain whether he had been pushed. “Police visited the scene and could not immediately establish the circumstances behind the incident,” police said. Kibet’s body had blood oozing from the nose and visible injuries at the back of the head, police said Monday. The body of the student was moved to the Chiromo mortuary awaiting post-mortem which will help unravel the mystery behind the death. Elsewhere, a milk vendor was arrested and detained at the Muthaiga Police Station after he stabbed a supplier during a quarrel over a Sh70 refund. Police in Starehe said that the suspect, Henry Mugambi Gitonga, picked a knife from his kiosk and stabbed Moffat Kwomboki, 25, after a quarrel. The quarrel, according to police, was triggered by a previously supplied packet of milk which the suspect complained had gone sour. “When Moffat did not honour the demand, he (Gitonga) stabbed him thrice in the chest killing him instantly,” police said.
