Nasa leaders have begun trooping into Uhuru Park ahead of the planned swearing-in of principals Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga was among the first to arrive. ARRIVAL More leaders came in including Rangwe MP Lilian Gogo, Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, MPs Elisha Odhiambo (Gem) and National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi (Suba South). Ms Gogo said it was a “wait-and-see situation” but now that their supporters had arrived, leaders would soon arrive at the park. “We are not relenting on anything and the people's power must triumph today,” Ms Wanga said. KIBERA Kibera was calm as tens of youth walked in groups towards Uhuru Park, through Ngong Road. The group passed by a contingent of anti-riot police officers camping at Nairobi Area Traffic Headquarters. The police had armoured vehicles, water cannons and batons. Some Nasa supporters were holding twigs and blowing vuvuzelas and whistles, while others were travelling by bus and matatu heading to Uhuru Park. Inside Kibera, there was no police presence and a few shops were operating. Very few vehicles were on the road and construction of the roads and structures are on uninterrupted.
