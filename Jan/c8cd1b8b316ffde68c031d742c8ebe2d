Traders at Obunga Estate in Kisumu County were counting losses after a fire burnt down their business premises on Friday night. About 30 shops were destroyed by the inferno, which is suspected to have been caused by a jiko left unattended in one of the hotels. LOSSES Kisumu County Commander John Kamau said there were no casualties and investigations are underway. Shops, drinking joints, hotels, salons, a cyber and video show business were destroyed.   On Saturday morning, traders combed through the rabble, trying to salvage what was left of their property. The loss is estimated at Sh5 million. “It is a big loss for us. I have lost about Sh500,000. I had three refrigerators full of drinks. There were also nine crates of beer plus the chairs and tables, all which were consumed,” said Mr Philip Ochieng. OVERWHELMED According to residents, they tried to put out the fire but it spread fast and took the efforts of firefighters to put it out. “People responded immediately but they were overwhelmed because the fire was spreading fast. We are happy firefighters came immediately and helped us put it out,” said Ms Nancy Akoth.   Many fires have been reported in Kisumu in the last few months, the worst being the fires of December 20 and 23. In the first fire, two brothers were burnt to death in Milimani Estate, while in the second two revellers were burnt to death at Dream City nightclub in Kondele. Last week, a woman was also burnt in a fire at Bandani area, and she was rushed to hospital.   The fire started when the pupils were in a church service.
