Seven Cabinet Secretaries who were dropped from the line-up got a soft landing after the President nominated them for ambassadorial positions. Dr Cleopa Mailu, who had a troubled tenure at the Health ministry, was nominated to be Kenya’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, Switzerland. While at Afya House, the ministry’s headquarters, he was on spotlight over a drawn-out strike by doctors. At one time, his docket was hit by a Sh5 billion scandal in which the money was allegedly looted after officials took advantage of loopholes in the Integrated Financial Management Information System. Ms Judi Wakhungu, formerly of Environment was named envoy to France. She will be remembered as the CS who outlawed the production and use of polythene bags. DROPPED Prof Jacob Kaimenyi was moved from the Lands ministry and nominated to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. Before the Lands ministry, he had served as the CS for Education. Other CSs who were dropped were Ms Phyllis Kandie, formerly of EAC and was named ambassador to Belgium, Luxemborg and the European Union, a fairly influential position and which builds on her tenure at the ministry. Mr Dan Kazungu, who was Mining CS, is the nominee for the High Commission in Tanzania. From the Agriculture ministry, Mr Willy Bett was named the High Commissioner to India. His colleague from the Sports ministry, Mr Hassan Wario, is set to be the envoy to Austria. Other newly named envoys were former MP Kiema Kilonzo (Uganda) and Mr Lazarus Amayo (UN Mission in New York).   With only six out of 21 nominees, the question of gender representation is likely to come up during vetting.
