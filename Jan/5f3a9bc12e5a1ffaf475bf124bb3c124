A man who confessed to killing his father for refusing to sub-divide the family’s land was severely tortured by police before admitting to the offence, the High Court in Nyeri heard Tuesday. Mr Moses Wachira Wanjeru, 37, told the judge that he was assaulted by two officers at Othaya Police Station who forced him to record a confession and sign consent. Mr Wanjeru is charged with Mr Peter Wanjeru Wachira’s murder on February 19, 2010 at Gituiga Village in Othaya. Through lawyer Gathiga Mwangi, the accused said when he was undergoing mental tests at Nyeri Provincial General Hospital as he was bleeding from both ears following the torture. “The doctor’s report indicates that the accused was bleeding from both ears. The doctor noted in his findings that the suspect said he was assaulted by police to obtain a confession,” said the lawyer. While poking holes into evidence presented by the investigating officer Francis Wambua, the lawyer told the court that the confession could not be relied on in court since the officer who recorded it, was not in the witness box. Mr Wambua had produced in court a machete, spade and a hoe which he said were the murder weapons. The case will continue on March 6.
