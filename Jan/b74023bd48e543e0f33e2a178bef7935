Police in Kwale County are looking for a man believed to have killed his wife in Maendeleo Village, Kinango Sub-County. The suspect, Onesmus Mutuku Kilonzo, is said to have cut his wife on the head on Tuesday night. Kwale County Commissioner Karuku Ngumo said the assailant fled and left behind a blood-stained panga. He said preliminary investigations revealed the killing was linked to a domestic feud. QUARREL OVER PHONE "We have established that the deceased was fatally cut on the head by the husband with a pangaÂ on Tuesday night following a domestic quarrel over a phone," he said. Mr Ngumo said the incident occurred at around 1am, adding that they have launched a search for the suspect and appealed to locals to help in his arrest. "The police have mounted a search for the assailant who fled leaving behind the weapons used to kill his wife," said Mr Ngumo. A source who talked to Nation but declined to be named said that they were shocked to learn of the incident because the couple were seen working together a day before the heinous act. "We knew of the incident on Wednesday late in the afternoon after a neighbour saw two children seated outside their house while the door was locked and asked them why they had not gone to school only to report that their mother had been killed by the father," said the source. POLICE INFORMED The source added that on learning of the ordeal, the neighbour alerted other villagers who immediately informed the police. "We were forced to break the door and found the mother of the two children lying lifeless in a pool of blood in her bed," said the source. Meanwhile, a man, 55, was found murdered, apparently by his two sons, in Msaroni Village, Kinango Sub-County. Mwaringa Katana was hit with a blunt object on the head and killed by his two sons after a disagreement over a cow he wanted to sell. The two bodies were moved to Kinango Hospital mortuary awaiting post-mortem.
