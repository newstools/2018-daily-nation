Starehe MP Charles Njagua alias Jaguar has moved to court to have the ban imposed on boda boda riders within the Nairobi Central Business District be lifted. In a suit filed against the Nairobi County government and its governor Mike Sonko, Mr Njagua claimed that the ban may result to more harm than good since boda boda riders will be rendered jobless. Through lawyer Duncan Okatch, he termed the decision to ban the ferrying of passengers on motorcycles within city centre as ill-informed since boda boda riding is a noble source of livelihood and that all operators have now been given a blanket condemnation. “Boda boda ban has caused a great public outcry as it has stripped many individuals of their noble source of livelihood therefore leaving many to wallow in joblessness and poverty in this hard economic times,” said Mr Okatch. ARREST The ban was issued on Tuesday by Nairobi County. In the directive, the county warned that anyone found ferrying passengers in the Nairobi CBD will face arrest and seizing of their motorcycles besides paying a hefty fine. Whilst the Nairobi county government said the ban was a means of curbing rising crime perpetrated by criminals on motorcycles, Mr Njagua argues that the decision was a blanket blame. He alleged that the decision only made unilaterally without consultations from key stakeholders or adequate notice. He also alleged that fair administrative action demands that stake holders be consulted before such a decision is made and sufficient notice is issued. The MP therefore wants an order issued quashing the boda boda ban and that the Nairobi County government be compelled to release motorcycles impounded for violating the directive. He also wants the county government and the governor barred from interfering with boda boda operators.
