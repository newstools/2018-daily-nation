Nine people died after a matatu they were travelling in veered off the road and rolled in Ndaragwa along the Nyeri-Nyahururu road. Seven other people among them children sustained injuries and were taken to Nyahururu County Referral Hospital. The hospital medical superintendent Dr Lawrence Kamande said survivors who were critically injured were admitted at the hospital and are undergoing treatment. BURIAL CEREMONY The victims were part of a team travelling home after a burial ceremony in Mukurwe-ini, Nyeri. Nyandarua County police boss Philip Opiyo said five people died on the spot and four others, including a two-year-old died at the hospital.  The police boss said the driver of the ill-fated vehicle lost control of the matatu. “The vehicle veered off the road and rolled several times before landing in a ditch,” Mr Opiyo said. It has since emerged that the victims were from the same village - Shauri - in Ndaragwa and most of them were relatives. TEACHER Survivors say the driver of the matatu was a teacher at Baari Primary School in Mairo-Inya Township and was its owner. He is among those who died on the spot. Residents said the teacher had acquired the vehicle less than two months ago. Survivors said the teacher had on several occasions ignored calls not to speed before the 14-seater matatu rolled several times.
