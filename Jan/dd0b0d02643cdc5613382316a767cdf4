The Education Ministry has given guidelines regarding the yellow paint for school buses and vans ahead of the March 31 deadline. In a directive to regional and county directors of education, the ministry said the paint should be lead-free and pantone-solid coated. Principals were also asked to find qualified painters for the work, which is estimated to cost the institutions at least Sh150,000 for every bus, according to vehicle dealers. “Following the enactment of the 2017 Traffic (Amendment) Act, the cabinet secretary has ordered all school vehicles used to transport children be painted yellow by March 31, 2018,” according to the directive by Education PS Belio Kipsang. SAFETY BELTS The CS said the order was in line with the law, which will also require the buses to have safety belts. The school name is to be written on the bus in black. Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers Secretary-General Akelo asked the government to shoulder the costs of repainting the buses, a request the ministry said it would consider. According to the Act, speed limits for the school vehicles will be fixed at 50 kilometres per hour and they will restricted to operate between 6am and 6pm. While several institutions have already adopted the changes, a majority of public schools are yet to do so. Other vehicles that regularly transport school children are, however, exempt from the stringent rules. All school buses in the United States and Canada are yellow. A similar proposal has been mooted in the United Kingdom.   They must also be fitted with seat belts and driven at a maximum of 50km/hr.
