Low cost airline Jambojet has launched flights to Wajir town. Its first flight on the route is expected to take off from Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on  February 14. The airline’s executives said they are targeting domestic travellers comprising traders, investors, government workers and employees of local and international aid agencies in the region. Additional aircraft “We are confident that our product will appeal greatly to government, business and leisure travellers alike,” said Jambojet chief executive Willem Hondius. Mr Hondius said the fleet expansion drive has enabled the airline to expand its scheduled operations and grow the number of destinations adding the airline is expecting an additional aircraft in mid-February this year. Earlier in the month, the budget airline increased frequencies across all its routes in the country in an effort to offer additional flight choices to its customers.
