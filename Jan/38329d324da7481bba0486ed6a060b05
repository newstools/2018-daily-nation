Three-time Kenya Open champion Christopher Saina from General Service Unit will represent Kenya at Gold Coast Commonwealth Games due April 4-15 in Australia. Saina weathered through a dry and windy course at the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) Shooting Laikipia Range to claim the only ticket available in the five-day full-bore competition. It will be the second time Saina is making it to the "Club" Games after his debut at the 2014 Glasgow Games, having beaten five of Kenya's finest firers in the head-to-head clash. Saina, the 2011, 2012 and 2014 national champion, returned an aggregate of 1853 points that included 143 vee-bulls, beating club mate Sanford Otundo, the 2015 and 2017 Kenya Open champion, by 70 points on 1813.128v. CIVILIAN THIRD Anthony Dodds, a civilian, returned 1808.130 for third place with John Ihugo from Kenya Police (Railways) settling fourth on 1770.124v followed by veteran Satiender Sehmi (Kenya Regiment Rifle Club-KRRC) 1761. 88v. The only lady firer at the trials, Grace Rantile from GSU, settled fifth on 1690.108v. Saina never looked back after he claimed the lead from Dodds, who led on Day One with a score of 996.8v against Saina’s 968.76v. “The conditions were tough with gusting winds and heavy mirage,” said the 42-year-old Saina, who is a senior sergeant. Saina, who finished 20th overall in Glasgow, is targeting an improved show in Gold Coast. “I was in the top 10 going into the last 1000m in Glasgow but crazy things happened,” said Saina. Saina joins small-bore firers Gurupreet Dhanjal and Gulraaj Sehmi all from KRRC for the Commonwealth Games. Dhanjal and Sehmi qualified automatically by virtue of having attained the universal qualifying standard mark of 587. Dhanjal won both the Kenya Open and Mini Bisley titles with 592 and 594 points respectively last year while Sehmi claimed the Colortunes and Shammi Singh Memorial championships with 595 and 596 points respectively. The remaining two slots will be filled from Air Pistol (men and women) and prone (women). Kenya has been allocated five slots in shooting at the “Club” Games.
