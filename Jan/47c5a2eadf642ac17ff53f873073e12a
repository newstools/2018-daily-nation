Kakamega Homeboyz on Monday signed speedy winger John Ndirangu on loan from Gor Mahia for one year. “Securing a number in the first eleven at Gor Mahia was difficult. The team has committed players making it hard for one to have regular playing time in the outfit. I hope to get more time here,” Ndirangu said after putting pen to paper. Homeboyz have revealed their title ambitions with some high profile signings including that of goal poacher Allan Wanga, who joined the team from deposed champions Tusker. Homeboyz have had a consistent run in the top league under Mike Mururi but never threatened to win the title.
