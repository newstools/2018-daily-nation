The Challenge is quite an interesting concept, held annually at the Britam Guineas Classic. There does not have to be a winner, in order for a result to be served. As it happens, on Sunday, none of our visitors found the post first, but, they were still awarded points for placings. Brendon McNaughton from Zimbabwe faired best, with Kenya’s Richard Kibet in second, Dinesh Sooful representing Mauritius was third, and Deon Sampson fourth. Trainer, Patsy Sercombe managed to commute a smart contingency of commuters - Quickfire, Shaman, White Dragon (Guineas), and, Pharoah’s Advocate (Graham Trophy). Hats off to Patsy and Lesley, colouring the sport as much as possible. Staunch supporter, Mim Haynes, never gives up. She has now gone the extra mile, becoming chairman of the whole enterprise. Positive thinking is all we need for horse racing to wallow up to ensure every meeting is on an equivalence with Britam’s kind generosity.
