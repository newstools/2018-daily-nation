EABL #ticker:EABL booked a Sh700 million gain in the half year to December from the sale of a disused brewery and a piece of land in Mombasa, cushioning the firm’s bottom-line in the wake of higher costs and weak performance in the Kenyan market. The regional brewer Friday revealed that it sold the prime property, which sits on a six-acre piece of land in Mombasa’s Shimanzi Industrial Area, for Sh800 million. The gain booked helped shore up EABL’s net earnings which came under pressure due to the extended electioneering period. The brewer’s after-tax profit for the six months to December dipped 11.3 per cent to Sh4.95 billion, mainly due a Sh1.5 billion drop in sales of Senator Keg, the low-cost drink. “During the half-year, we sold the property to a private entity. We have been leasing it from Kenya Railways so we simply transferred this obligation to somebody else,” Andrew Cowan, EABL’s managing director, said in an interview. The Mombasa facility, which was commissioned in February 1952, was one of two breweries (alongside the Kisumu plant) that EABL operated outside Nairobi. The factories were later closed, with the brewer centralising production and distribution operations at its Ruaraka headquarters in Nairobi. EABL has over the past six year sold off assets (its Ruaraka headquarters, acres of land, and a glass-making subsidiary), divestitures that have helped shore up its bottom-line. Mr Cowan says these sales are in line with brewer’s strategy to shed non-core assets and direct the funds realised to its main business of making and selling alcoholic beverages.
