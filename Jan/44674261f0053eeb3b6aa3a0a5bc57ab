A section of Kisumu youth stormed the county government headquarters early Monday demanding more money to attend the swearing-in event of Nasa leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka in Nairobi. The young people claimed the Sh100, 000 given to them by the county government is not enough to cater for over 400 Nasa supporters who had expressed interest to attend the event. Bunge la Wananchi vice-chairperson Felix Juma accused local leaders of not supporting their plans to participate in the event. "We need food and accommodation while in Nairobi. The money is not enough for all of us," Mr Juma said. Efforts by Kisumu County ODM vice-chairman Kennedy Ajwang to calm the protestors failed. Police manning the entrance to the building kept a distance but were ready to pounce had the matter got out stayed put to ensure no ugly scenes were witnessed. Earlier, the youths accosted Kisumu County Assembly Majority Leader Kennedy Onyango at the county offices and he was forced to part with some money to be used to hire a bus. "Some of the ODM elected members are not taking the swearing-in event seriously," Peter Owuor, Bunge la Wananchi Speaker, said. He warned the local leaders of unspecified consequences should they fail to secure them transport to and from Nairobi. The protesters did not get audience with Governor Anyang' Nyong'o nor his deputy Dr Mathews Owili.   Police warned against any meeting and the Nairobi government said the park was being renovated.
