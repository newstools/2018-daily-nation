A standard seven pupil was attacked and killed by a crocodile at Rindwa Beach in Rarieda sub-County early on Friday morning. George Ogaja, 16, a pupil at Kokise Primary School and his two friends had gone to take a bath at the shores of Lake Victoria in Siaya County when the reptile attacked him. SEARCH East Asembo Location Chief Fredrick Omino said the boy’s body has not yet been retrieved from the lake. A group of fishermen were frantically searching for the body on Friday. The chief said that the rescuers had earlier spotted the crocodile trying to lift the body up but it disappeared. "The searchers in 10 boats are dedicated to pick out the body, which they believe is still nearby. They have cordoned off the area with an aim of fulfilling their search mission," said Mr Omino. A neighbour, Ochieng’ Riako, said the children had gone to bathe before heading to school. "The boys always took a bath at the beach before leaving for school," he said. FEAR Mr Riako complained about the increased cases of crocodile attacks in the area and urged the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) officers to come to their rescue. "We are now living in great fear because of the rampant attacks and we do not know who will be the next victim. We therefore plead for immediate government intervention to help contain the situation," he said. The incident was confirmed by Rarieda OCPD Yohana Chebii who asked residents to be cautious. He said authorities have informed KWS about the attack and wardens will be deployed in the area to search for the body as well as to contain the rogue reptile. "We are optimistic of retrieving the body from the lake. The residents should be cautious in order to avoid a repeat of such an incident," said Mr Chebii.   They want boreholes so they can avoid crocodile attacks in Lake Victoria.
