A sombre mood engulfed Tingare Ywaya Village in Siaya County Saturday during the burial of seven family members who perished in a road crash in Sultan Hamud, Makueni County in December 2017 while on their way to a funeral. Ms Pelestiah Anyango, 78, who lost two sons and their wives and three other close relatives is yet to recover from the shock. Mama Anyango lost her sons Alfred Owino, 57, Charles Osama, 47, and Charles Ohuru, 40, who died alongside their wives Alice Kasango and Roselida Mukhwana. They were also accompanied by other members of their extended family, Mrs Angelina Okello and her son Joseph Obel who also perished. Ms Anyango said that her sons were heading to the burial of a cousin's father in-law in Makueni when the hearse ferrying them collided with a truck killing them on the spot. LAS MOMENTS She recalled the last moments she spoke with one of her sons Charles Osama who informed her of their planned travel to Ukambani to attend the burial of Alfred Onyango's father-in-law in Makueni County.  "I still can't believe that my sons are gone. I wished God would take one of them and leave me one,” she said. The funeral was attended by politicians led by Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga. Mr Rasanga assured the affected families of his support since one of the fallen brothers, Charles Osama, a teacher at Ukalama Primary School, was his staunch supporter.  "I am devoted to supporting the bereaved family as a way of returning a favour following their support for my re-election," said Mr Rasanga. However, the funeral was dominated by politics. Mr Rasanga said the swearing-in of Nasa leader Raila Odinga on January 30 is on course as planned.
