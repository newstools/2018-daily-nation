Kenyan international defender David ‘Cheche’ Ochieng’ has joined Swedish top flight club IF Brommapojkarna on a three-year contract. The 25-year-old put pen to paper yesterday at the club’s base in Stockholm, moments after jetting into the Scandinavian country from Kenya. He joins compatriot Eric Johanna who signed a similar deal in December. “I’m grateful to be here, it’s a good club with good organization and a good coach,” the former Tusker man was quoted saying in the club’s official website. He moves from America where he was playing second division football with New York Cosmos. “I bring a lot of experience from playing in South America and the United States,” he said. “I’m used to playing big matches with a lot of audiences, so I can contribute with the experience of it and spread a calm in the group,” said Ochieng’.  “We welcome David to BP, a defender who has the qualities we searched and looked at. David also has international experience that will be valuable to us,” BP Sporting Director Daniel Majstorovic said.  Brommapojkarna booked a ticket to the Swedish top tier league - Allsvenskan after finishing top of the 16-team 2017 Supperretan table.
