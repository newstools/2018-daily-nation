Former Mukurwe-ini MP Kabando wa Kabando’s brother beheaded their mother with a machete after chasing her in their compound, the High Court in Nyeri heard yesterday. Investigating officer Patrick Oyalo told Justice Jairus Ngaah that Ceasar Thiari had also attempted to flee but was arrested by residents and an AP officer attached to Ngamwa AP post. Mr Thiari is charged with murdering 70-year-old Rose Wachera Mwangi on July 27, 2014, at her home in Kaini village, Mukurwe-ini, Nyeri County. MURDER The 16th witness, presented in court by Senior Counsel Kennedy Magoma, said that according to his analysis, Wachera was hacked to death as she ran to save her life. Mr Oyalo said Wachera’s  body was lying about 30 metres from her house and 12 metres from the main gate. “I arrived at the scene at about 2.30pm and found the deceased’s body lying in a pool of blood. Only a small piece of flesh on the neck was connecting the head to the body,” he said. “There were also blood drops towards the house. I followed the blood drops up to a point near the house where there were two chairs. I realised that Wachera was separating beans from chaff on a tray before the incident,” Mr Oyalo said. DEEP CUTS He added that the victim had deep cuts on the head, back, shoulders and hands and that she screamed for help before she died. “Residents volunteered to speak to me. Among them was Lydia Wairimu, Lydia Gathoni and Agnes Njeri who responded to the screams and they told me they met the accused at the gate saying ‘nimemmaliza’ (I have finished her),” said Mr Oyalo, who is now at Kisumu’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations. However, Mr Thiari, through his lawyer, disputed the witnesses’ evidence, saying some statements had discrepancies. The court will decide whether or not the accused has a case to answer on March 8.
