Former assistant minister Danson Mungatana is among 25 people shortlisted for the position of the clerk of the Tana River County Assembly. Mr Mungatana who will be fighting it out with former acting clerk Mohammed Hassan Dube and one legal officer, Timna Komora. Mr Mungatana tried his luck for the gubernatorial seat in the August 8, 2017 elections and came fourth after defying the decision of the elders who endorsed Rtd Major Godhana Gadaye for the seat. His quest to serve under Governor Godhana’s regime saw him try his luck in the county assembly, where he applied for the position of the Speaker only to later quit the race just two days to the election. Mr Justin Nkaduda was elected county assembly Speaker. Mr Mungatana’s latest move has caught many by surprise as during campaigns, he was on record saying he would not accept any other position in the county apart from that of governor. The Tana River County Assembly has been operating without a clerk, with the position being held by an interim clerk appointed by the defunct Transition Authority.
