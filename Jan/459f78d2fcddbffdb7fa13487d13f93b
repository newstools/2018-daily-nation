Three governors have pledged their support towards Sh3.6 billion six-year European Union funding programme to rehabilitate water towers in 11 counties. Addressing a conservation meeting attended by EU delegation to Kenya together with Environment Cabinet Secretary Judi Wakhungu in an Eldoret Hotel, governors Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo-Marakwet) Wilbur Ottichilo (Vihiga), host Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and Kisumu County Deputy Governor Mathews Owili who represented Prof Anyang Nyong’o, said it was their resolve to give the undertaking a green light. “Matters to do with environmental conservation are not negotiable. We either conserve the water towers to live or we destroy them and perish,” said Mr Mandago. Prof  Wakhungu (above) said the government was keen about the launch of the Water Towers Partnership Programme between the EU and the Kenyan government. The programme according to the Cabinet secretary will be implemented by multi-agency comprising Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forest Service, Kenya Water Towers Agency. “The biggest challenge the world is facing today is climate change,  but how to mitigate the effects of this climate change is to conserve the environment,” said Prof Wakhungu.
