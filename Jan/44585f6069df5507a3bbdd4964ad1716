More than 3,000 athletes are expected to participate in the 27th edition of Discovery Cross Country in Eldoret on Sunday. London 2013 World 10,000m bronze medallist Agnes Tirop is easily one of the star attraction in the cross country meet. She will run in the senior women’s 10km race. In the junior category, World Under-18 silver medallist Cleophas Kandie, World U-18 800m silver medallist Lydia Jeruto and Justus Soget are expected to feature in the junior categories. According to David Letting, who is one of the organisers, preparations are over and they are looking forward to a successful race. “The race will be competitive and we are just waiting for the athletes on Sunday to showcase their talents,” said Letting. Last years’ winners Bedan Karoki and Irene Cheptai will not be lining up. Karoki, who has been named in the IAAF World Half Marathon team, said that he will not be participating as the race was not part of his training programme for the up coming RAK Half Marathon in the United Arab Emirates on February 9. Karoki is currently training in Nyahururu after returning from Japan where he has been working and training at the same time. World Half Marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor will also not feature in the Eldoret race.
