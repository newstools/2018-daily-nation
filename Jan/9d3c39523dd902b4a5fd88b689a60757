Some members of the county assembly are behaving badly and fast becoming the scourge of the society with unimaginable notoriety. Their crass and uncouth behaviour is well beneath what is expected of leaders whose cardinal duty is not only to articulate their people’s interests but also serve as role models. The several ugly incidents so early in the new year show some of the MCAs are unfit to hold public office. Their actions are in contravention of the Public Officer Ethics Act, which has a comprehensive code of conduct. Indeed, if enforced, these wayward leaders would be disqualified and even prosecuted for their criminal conduct. Murang’a County would easily claim the cup for this apparent criminal notoriety. The MCAs are behaving like hoodlums. They have fought in public twice over leadership when, ideally, they should be negotiating in the Chambers and seeking accommodation amicably. On Tuesday, the Majority Leader engaged in fisticuffs with MCAs who reportedly tried to take over his office. Some of their colleagues in Bungoma, Makueni and Kapenguria have been arrested and charged over their crude attempts to block principals posted to schools in their areas from accessing their new stations. These rotten apples must not be allowed to soil an office meant to enhance governance at the grassroots and mobilise people and resources to spur development.
