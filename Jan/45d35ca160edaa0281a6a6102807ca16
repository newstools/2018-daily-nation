Hi Brenda, Thanks for your advice and for your honesty. Now, my problem is this cute man I’ve been dating (I wish I could share his photo!) who keeps saying he misses me on WhatApp chat but whenever I suggest we meet, he gives me a loose answer like “We’ll do it soon” or “next week”. I know he’s into me because when we first met, we spoke for three hours straight and shared a kiss! What’s wrong with him that he won’t even commit to a date six months after the kiss? Help me understand him better because I’m about to give up. Thank you for the complement but honey, I hate to break it to you but here it goes: he’s just not that into you. And clearly, you’re not on his list of priorities so why is he on yours? So what if you shared a passionate soap opera-worthy kiss and a long conversation? This man, by all definitions, is a player who is keeping his options wide open. Don’t fall into his trap, girl. Save yourself. Delete his number and keep searching for your prince. Good luck! *** Do you have a problem for Brenda?
