Uganda-based American Ray Leybovich on Sunday won honours in the combined MX1, MXC2 and 125cc category as the 2018 Kenya National Motocross series got underway at the Jamhuri Park Circuit. Leybovich, who is coach of Uganda, was the only entrant in MX1, with Kenya’s Rolf Kihara and Maxine Wahome competing in first leg of MX2 that witnessed key withdrawals, including the regional and Kenya MX1 champion Ngugi Waweru. Seven riders, among them Uganda’s Stav Orland, entered the 125cc category. Kenya’s Kigen Kiplagat finished second with 57 points behind Leybovich on 60. Leybovich won all the three stages but Kiplagat returned second in the first stage followed by a third place finish in the second and third stages. Orland came in third on 54 points after finishing third in the first stage, fourth in second and second in third. He beat Kihara to fourth place overall, followed by 125cc rider John Schrier of Kenya. However, points for the national championships counted from the 125cc contest where national champion Ethan Nyachae was missing in action. Kiplagat, who finished second overall last season in the category, won with 60 points, beating Schrier to second with 49 points while Zenni Onditi came in third with 47 points followed by Christian Chege (39) and Michael Ohonde (33). Dylan Mutahi won all the three stages in 85cc category for 60 points, beating Tai Wahome on 51 and Vince Schrier with 40 points. The only Uganda in the event was Jonathan Muhindo, who scored 25 points to finish eighth. Uganda’s Alon Orland won all the third legs, returning 60 points to win 65cc.
