A farmer in Lolgorian, Narok County is counting losses estimated at about Sh1.5 million after his 18 cows drunk a poisonous effluent from a gold processing factory and died. The effluent was emanating from the Kilimapesa Goldmines in Transmara Sub-County. According to Joseph Tipaa, the owner of the cows, his cattle were grazing near the gold processing plant before they consumed the dirty water in a trench trickling from leach tanks used in the extraction of gold. A brother of the farmer, Mr Phillip Tipaa, who spoke to Nation by phone said the cows were being looked after by an 11-year old boy before the incident happened at around 3pm Saturday.   FAMILY LIFELINE "The owner of the cows is my brother. He has three wives and more than 10 children. Their economic lifeline was this afternoon crippled because of negligence by the Goldplat company that releases poisonous effluent to the environment," said Phillip. He said he had reported the matter to the county National Environment Management Authority (Nema) Director of Environment Patrick Lekenit and County Commissioner Moffat Kangi for further action. According to the farmer, the gold processing company buried the cows and promised to compensate the family. Mr Lekenit confirmed the incident and said Nema officers based in Transmara and security officers had gone to the plant to establish what happened. "We have received the information of dead cows in Lolgorian. Our officers are already on the ground to establish what happened," said MR Lekenit. Efforts to reach the owners of the gold processing plant were futile as calls went an answered.
