The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has summoned four Kericho MCAs for grilling following the recent scuffle in the House over the Sh100 million Kerenga airstrip upgrade project. South Rift Regional EACC boss Gilbert Lukhoba on Monday wrote to each of the four MCAs summoning them to appear before the commission on January 29 for questioning. “The four four MCAs have been summoned to attend investigative interviews and record statements regarding the incident that occurred on January 15, 2018 where they allegedly fought and were engaged in other altercations within the county assembly,” reads the letter to the ward representatives. The MCAs summoned are Mr Albert Kipkoech, Mr Paul Chirchir, Mr Eric Bii, and Mr Josephat Ruto. Also invited to record statements are the county assembly Speaker, the assembly clerk, the sergeant at arms and other officials. They are to explain the chaos that rocked the assembly. EACC is also investigating the MCAs for serious offences which amount to breach of the integrity and ethical code which they recently signed. “Fighting in the assembly, removal of the official mace or any such behaviour is degrading conduct and does not accord with the values, principles and requirements of the Constitution,” noted Mr Lukhoba. Last week, the MCAs fought after they differed over the Kerenga airstrip upgrade project by the county government. The MCAs were split between those supporting the upgrading of the airstrip and those opposed to it. All the 47 Kericho MCAs were in the chamber ready to debate the Kericho Supplementary Appropriation Bill, 2017 when the fracas broke. Some ward representatives are said to have thrown the mace out of the assembly shattering window panes. It was retrieved later by the sergeant-at-arms and security guards.   The total budget for the project will amount to Sh1 billion when complete.
