A 23-year-old man denied violently robbing a bank in Kajiado but admitted being in possession of a phone stolen during the robbery. Simon Mwaniki was charged that, with others not before the court, they used pistols to steal Sh1.8 million from Post Bank in Kajiado Town. The robbery took place on Saturday, December 30, 2017. Appearing before Kajiado Chief Magistrate Susan Shitubi, Mr Mwaniki denied the first count of violently robbing a bank but admitted the second count of being in possession of phone stolen from bank employees during the robbery. In mitigation, and explaining how he came to be in possession of the stolen phone, Mr Mwaniki said that he picked it on the ground. The magistrate set the hearing of the case for March 14, 2018, with mention on February 5. In the same court, a woman was charged with being in possession of bhang worth Sh500,000 in Namanga Town. Cecilia Wairimu Njoroge pleaded not guilty to the charge and was released on a Sh300,000 bond awaiting hearing. She pleaded to have the bond reduced but the magistrate declined to reduce it.
