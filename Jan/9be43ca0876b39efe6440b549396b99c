Two brothers suspected of killing their father in Msaroni Village, Kinango Sub-County, have surrendered to the police. Rima Mbui, 35, and Ndurya Mbui, 30, surrendered themselves at Vigurungani Police Station in Kwale County and were arrested. COURT Kwale County Commissioner Karuku Ngumo said the two would be arraigned in court in connection with their fatherâ€™s murder. "They will be arraigned in court once investigations are complete," he said. The suspects are alleged to have killed their father Mwaringa Katana, 55, on Tuesday using a blunt object following a disagreement over a cow he wanted to sell. KILLING Meanwhile police have intensified a manhunt for Onesmus Mutuku Kilonzo, who is suspected of killing his wife in Maendeleo Village in the same sub-County. Police have linked the Tuesday 1am killing to a domestic quarrel over a phone. The suspect is accused of hacking his wife to death using a panga and fleeing the scene. Mr Ngumo urged members of the public to cooperate with the police and help in the arrest of the suspect.
