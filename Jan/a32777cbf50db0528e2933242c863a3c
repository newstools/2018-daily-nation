Kenyan Premier League side Posta Rangers have completed the signing of veteran midfielder Osborne Monday and Ugandan striker George Abege. The two penned three-year deals at the mailmen’s offices in Nairobi on Friday. “We are done with the signings and now focus shifts to intensive preseason preparations,” said club chairman John Tonui.  “Our aim is to compete this season and we believe the signings we’ve made will be key in meeting our targets.” Monday ditched Kariobangi Sharks barely a year after joining the William Muluya-led side. He was part of the Tusker squad that won the league and GOtv Shield in 2016. His experience from his time at Mathare United, Sofapaka and Tusker will be a boost to Sammy ‘Pamzo’ Omollo - who guided the team to a fourth place finish last season. Abege, formerly of City Stars and Bandari, meanwhile joins from Sony Sugar where he netted nine league goals last term. The team had earlier confirmed the acquisition of defenders Suleiman Ngotho (Thika United) and Kennedy Onyango (Nakumatt), wingers Danson Kago (Tusker) and Marcellus Ingotsi (AFC Leopards), midfielder Peter Ng’ang’a (Nakuru AllStars) and forward Calvin Odongo (Kariobangi Sharks).
