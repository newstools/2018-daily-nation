A crackdown on muggers and robbery gangs in Nairobiâ€™s central business district by police has left three people dead. Two suspects believed to be leaders of one of the gangs were shot dead at the Railways bridge near Haile Selassie roundabout. Another suspect was gunned down at the Globe Cinema roundabout. The Nairobi County Security Committee on Monday activated an anti-mugging squad following an outcry by the public. Regional Commissioner Bernard Leparmarai, County Police Commander Japhet Koome and Regional Administration Police Commander Francis Mburu admitted that there had been an upsurge in muggings in the CBD and promised to crack down on it. Mr Koome promised that the criminals who had been snatching handbags from women and roughing up people coming out of ATMs, banks and forex bureaus would be eliminated from the city. Earlier Tuesday morning, Central police boss Robinson Thuku said a pedestrian was shot as police chased an armed group of youth along Landhies Road. Mr Thuku said the gang of five were confronted by police as they robbed pedestrians.   Police bosses say they have special teams to rein in the thugs.
