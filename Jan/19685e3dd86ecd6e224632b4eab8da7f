A Wundanyi court has sentenced a pastor to 14 years imprisonment for committing an unnatural act with an animal. Fikirini Charo alias Sylvester Masha of East African Pentecostal Church was sentenced after he was found guilty of committing the offence on September 22, 2017, at Mwakamu village in Taita Taveta County. He had denied the offences. While sentencing the 32-year-old, senior principal magistrate Nicholas Njagi said the offence the suspect committed left the court with no option but to hand him a custodial sentence. “The suspect may be a first offender and a bread winner but what he did betrays him as a pastor, the suspect should behave in a civilised manner as a religious leader,” he said. The court noted that prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.
