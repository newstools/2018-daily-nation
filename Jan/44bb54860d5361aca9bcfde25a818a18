A stun hand grenade was thrown into Kalonzo Musyoka’s Karen residence during dawn attack, police said. Detectives from the Bomb and Hazadrous Disposal Unit of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations confirmed Wednesday morning that the device was nolethal. Karen OCPD, Cunningham Suiyanka said police were investigating the incident to establish who hurled the sound bomb at the home. A stun grenade, which is also known as a flash grenade or a thunderflash is a device used to produce a loud sound, but has no shrapnels that can hurt a target. Mr Suiyanka said it was hard to immediately know who hurled the sound bomb at the house as CCTV cameras meant to capture footages from the compound’s exterior were faulty. “Investigation is ongoing and we hope to find leads using other means,” Mr Suiyanka said Wednesday afternoon. Police spokesman Charles Owino said officers are also investigating claims of gunfire after a live bullet was found inside Mr Kalonzo's compound. The 1am attack drew the attention of top police squads and formation commanders who arrived at the home to investigate the matter, which raised several questions among Kenyans and other leaders, a day after Mr Kalonzo skipped the ‘swearing-in’ of Nasa leader, Raila Odinga and himself.   Gunmen open fire outside Kalonzo's Karen home, hurl object into his compound.
