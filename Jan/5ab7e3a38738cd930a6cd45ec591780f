Five people riding on one motorcycle have been killed in a head-on collision between the bike and a vehicle near Museno market along the Kakamega-Kisumu road. Western region traffic police boss Geoffrey Njogu said the rider of the motorcycle was speeding when he veered off his lane and rammed into an oncoming Probox. The rider and his four pillion passengers were thrown into different directions in the Thursday 10pm collision. Mr Njogu said the rider could have lost control of the motorcycle because of the number of passengers he was carrying. FOUR PILLION PASSENGERS  “If you are carrying four passengers on a motorcycle, that makes it very difficult to navigate and control the bike. This could have contributed to the collision,” said Mr Njogu. The driver of the vehicle sustained injuries and was admitted to St Elizabeth Mission Hospital in Mukumu. Villagers blocked the road and attempted to burn the vehicle but police officers at the scene intervened and restored calm. In another road crash, one person was killed and 14 others injured after a matatu veered off the road at Shimalabandu area along the Kakamega-Weuye highway.    The area is a blackspot and the name Shimalabandu means 'finishing people' in the local dialect.  The driver of the matatu lost control of the matatu as he avoided hitting a pedestrian when he plunged into a ditch.
