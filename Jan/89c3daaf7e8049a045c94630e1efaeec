Kenyans wishing to travel to America can get visas despite the US government shutdown, but funding for key donor projects has been rendered uncertain following the unprecedented move last Friday. On Friday, US senators failed to achieve the required vote that would have extended funding for government operations by at least four weeks. This is the first time a government shutdown is being experienced when a majority party is also the one in the White House. SHUTDOWN The result means that only essential services such as border protection, national security and military services would continue getting funding. Even then, civil servants would not be guaranteed pay if they work during the shutdown period.For visa applicants at US embassies such as the Nairobi one, the State Department confirmed the services will continue, but only as far as it is possible to process them. “At this time, scheduled passport and visa services in the United States and at our posts overseas will continue during the lapse in appropriations as the situation permits, “ the Department announced on its website on Saturday night. CONGRESS “This website will not be regularly updated until full operations resume, with the exception of emergency safety and security information.” It all began when US senators failed to pass a Bill that would have extended federal funding to mid February and, therefore, ensure that services continue. But this vote came tied to another hot-potato issue of immigration. The funding Bill had initially passed in Congress but senators failed to achieve the required 60 votes to endorse it. Both Houses are controlled by Republicans, although crucial votes as this required an additional chip of the Democrat vote.
