Rattansi Education Trust has released Sh26million to support needy students in 20 private and public universities across the country this academic year. Speaking during the cheque donation exercise, the chairperson of the trust Vijoo Rattansi, challenged beneficiaries to put more effort in their academic endeavours. Dr Rattansi stressed the importance of forming ex-Rattansi beneficiaries’ alumni association saying the Alumni members would have the opportunity to mentor and interact with the other students. The cheques were issued on Thursday at the University of Nairobi Council Chambers to various heads of institutions. University of Nairobi Vice-Chancellor Peter Mbithi noted that the scholarship has helped many bright and needy students to pursue their university education at various universities across the country. The beneficiaries are now serving the society in various sectors within the country and abroad. “We are lucky to have you as our Chancellor and for supporting the needy and bright students,” he said. Prof Mbithi welcomed the idea of beneficiaries forming an association where they can share common value systems and express gratitude for the support they received. Last year, the trust donated scholarships Sh60 million during its 60th anniversary celebrations.
