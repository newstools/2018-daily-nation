The Nairobi County government has pledged to take care of the funeral expenses for the four people who died in a fire tragedy in Kijiji slum, Lang’ata Constituency, on Sunday. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko also said the county will support the families that lost property. “We will ensure that the deceased get a good send-off,” said Mr Sonko. He said his administration and the national government will provide temporary shelter and food to the affected families. “We condole with families who lost loved ones or rendered homeless after the unfortunate fire incident,” he said. SURVEY AND MAP SLUM The governor said the city county will survey and map the area before rebuilding takes place to ensure the informal settlement has access roads. “We reckon that it was a difficult mission for firefighters to put out the fire due to lack of access roads,” said Mr Sonko. He said that was part of the county’s plan, through the Department of Land, Urban Renewal and Housing led by County Executive Committee Member Peter Wachira. The county’s disaster management Tuesday contained three fire outbreaks — at Mji wa Huruma, Runda, Multiple Hauliers, Mombasa Road, and Equity Bank, Buruburu.   Fire engines ran out of water and left the scene.
