World champions Hellen Obiri (5,000 metres), Geoffrey Kirui (marathon) and world half marathon record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei will be among the star attractions at Friday's Kenya Defence Forces Cross Country Championships at the Moi Air Base, Nairobi. The 37th edition of the championships will be watched by, among others, Defence Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo and will start at 7am, featuring 12 teams namely Moi Air Base, Nairobi, Mtongwe, Thika, Kahawa and Lanet. Others are Nanyuki, Marsabit, Isiolo, Gilgil, Embakasi and Laikipia Air Base. NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS The meet will pick soldiers to represent the KDF at the national cross country championships and kick off a busy weekend that will also see the Kenya Police Service and Kenya Prisons Service national championships held Saturday at Nairobi’s Ngong Racecourse and Uhuru Gardens, respectively. It will be interesting to see the men and women that KDF pick for the nationals where they will face off with strong teams from Police, Prisons and the Rift Valley region. Over the years, KDF have produced world-beating athletes including Paul Tergat and John Ngugi who each won the IAAF World Cross Country Championships a record five times. Benjamin Limo, who along with John Kibowen dominated the now defunct short course (four-kilometre race) at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, also proudly flew the forces’ flag globally.
