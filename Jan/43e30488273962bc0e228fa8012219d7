LONDON Chelsea boss Antonio Conte revealed on Friday that he had a narrow escape when winds blew a glass table top off a roof terrace and onto his car parked at the club's training base. The Italian expressed relief that nobody was hurt in the incident earlier this month at Chelsea's Cobham training centre, southwest of London. "It was an accident, an incredible accident," Conte said. "I was having my lunch when this happened. The wind brought a big (piece of) glass on my car."If in that moment there is a person very close to my car, I don't know what (might have) happened." Conte was able to laugh off the incident, saying the damage to his modest car was "the last thing" on his mind. The Sun newspaper reported that the table top narrowly missed the club's director of communications, Steve Atkins.
