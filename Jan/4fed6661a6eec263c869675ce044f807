It also stretched the world number 14's winning streak to 14 matches including winning successive WTA tournaments in Moscow and Zhuhai late last year.Goerges made an immediate statement at the start of each set with service breaks. Games went with service from there in the first set, which Goerges sealed with her seventh ace.  Wozniacki double faulted at 15-40 at the start of the second set before she began to fight back. Goerges needed her booming serve to save break points at 2-1 and 3-2 before Wozniacki finally broke through to level at 4-4, sending the set into a tie break which went to the German.
