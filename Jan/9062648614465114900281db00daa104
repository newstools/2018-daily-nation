Taxi company Taxify Kenya has partnered with Total to give fuel discounts and subsidised prices on products to drivers operating under its application. Drivers using the Taxify application will be required to apply for the Total Card to enable them spend less money on fuel and thus increase their earnings. The partnership, according to Total Kenya Managing Director Anne-Solange Renouard, will result in significant brand synergies for the two partners and benefit the whole community by facilitating the development of mobility solutions. Total Kenya, the fourth largest oil and gas company in the world, assured Kenyan taxi operators that Total Card is a safe, simple and smart fuel management solution enabling better control on fuel expenditure. WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS “Additionally, the card can be used to access a wide range of products and services [in] over 190 service stations countrywide,” the company said. Taxify Kenya Nairobi City Manager Alex Mwaura said they are always looking out for partnerships and opportunities that will enable drivers reduce the cost of doing business and get better earnings. “We have always believed that happy drivers translate into better customer service to riders. Drivers are excited about reducing their fuel cost especially since the discount is instant at the pump," Mr Mwaura said. Taxify Kenya operates in Nairobi and Mombasa.
