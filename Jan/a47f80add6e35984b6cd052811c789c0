Zoo Kericho's Michael Madoya is the 2017 Kenyan Premier League's Most Valuable Player. The pint-sized midfielder surprisingly beat seasoned players including Kenyan international goalkepeer Patrick Matasi and veteran Gor Mahia forward Meddie Kagere to claim the prestigious award which was accompanied by a Sh1 million cash prize. Madoya meanwhile was the biggest winner of the show, also winning the Fair Player, New Player of the Year and Midfielder of the Year awards. The awards also had him cumulatively collect Sh1.7 million in prize money. "It wasn't easy," the diminutive midfielder, who was overcome with emotion, told the shocked audience which included Harambee Stars coach Paul Put and SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri. "It has been a tough journey. At some point, we struggled with court cases and we were even thrown out of the league. I thank God for everything." Mathare United's veteran defender George 'Wise' Owino walked away with the defensive award.  Kariobangi Sharks tactician William Muluya won the Coach of the Year Award after guiding the KPL debutantes to an impressive third-place finish. Harambee Stars striker Masoud Juma, who recently moved to South Africa's Cape Town City FC from Kariobangi Sharks, was awarded the Golden Boot after emerging top scorer in the 2017 season. Sofapaka, who finished second on the standings some 19 points adrift of champions Gor Mahia, were crowned the Fairplay Club of the Year. In a shocking turn of event, the Golden Glove Award was awarded to Posta Rangers custodian Matasi, pipping Kariobangi Sharks goalkeeper John Oyemba award. Matasi won the award in 2016. Badir Yasin was named the Centre Referee of the Year, with Jolawi Obondo going home with the Team Manager's gong.
