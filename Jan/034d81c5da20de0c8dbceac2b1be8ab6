Police in Gatundu are holding their colleague suspected to have defiled a minor inside police cells at 5am Saturday. The officer, according to a report by Gatundu OCS Joshua Nyasimu, is suspected to have defiled a 15-year-old girl who had been detained at the police station. Mr Nyasimu reported that the minor had complained that a police constable “had carnal knowledge of her against her will after removing her from cells to do some cleaning within the station”. However, the incident was not reported until Sunday when the girl approached a police officer manning the report office and told him of her ordeal. The girl who had been arrested on Friday, was taken to the Gatundu District Hospital for medical check-up and treatment, while the officer was arrested and detained at the Gatundu Police Station, which is also his work station. CHARGE OFFICER The police officer was Monday arraigned in a Gatundu South court but he did not take plea. Detectives requested for more time to complete investigations. The magistrate ordered that the matter be mentioned Tuesday... This incident comes just three months after another police officer allegedly defiled a 14-year-old girl inside the Murang’a Police Station cells. The officer was arrested after a whistle-blower who was an inmate at the same police station, said the officer defiled the girl, and threw a condom he had used to the roof of the station’s toilets. Police Constable Laban Maina Njogu was arraigned in court but denied the charges and was released on cash bail. On November 18, 2017 the hearing of the case against the officer was adjourned due to lack of DNA results. The case is still active in court.  Additional reporting by Mary Wambui
