African leaders are in Addis Ababa on Sunday and Monday for their annual meeting at the African Union headquarters, with noticeably little enthusiasm in their own countries about the value of these parleys. The irony, however, is this and previous meetings have often been tailored to address issues of vital importance to the continent and its people. The failure to see any benefits derived from these talks explains the frustration. The 30th Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly will focus on governance issues and the need to open up the continental airspace to African airlines. Indeed, there are too many governance challenges, including misrule, corruption, poverty, widespread underdevelopment and the growing threat of terrorism. ECONOMIC GROWTH Itâ€™s encouraging to note, therefore, that the leaders recognise these problems and keen to fix them. There is great potential for African airlines, but with each country trying to run its own, the result has been tiny, unviable entities that can hardly compete with the well-funded Middle East carriers and others. Opening the skies across the continent will boost economic growth. But like its predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity, the AU has failed to shed the image of a mere talk shop. It should by now have developed into an effective tool for continental mobilisation of resources for development. Regrettably, the AU meetings tend to be forums for the leaders to pursue their own interests or support one another. And yet this should be an organisation that champions the interests of the citizens, with the leaders providing the oversight to ensure that this happens.
