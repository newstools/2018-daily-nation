The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has threatened to take legal action against six county assemblies for failing to submit their 2015 compliance status reports. Vice-chair Sophia Lepuchirit said the non-complainant county assemblies include Busia, Homa Bay, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kisumu and Tana River. “It is not a threat but as the commission will not hesitate to move to court and to seek orders for any public entity which fails the commission’s request,” she said. CAPACITY BUILDING Speaking at Mombasa Beach Hotel during the official opening of a capacity building workshop of county assembly technical staff on the Declaration of Income, Assets and Liabilities, Ms Lepuchirit said some county assembly leaders are being investigated. She said the agency is monitoring the lifestyle of such individuals. “We will not allow public servants to steal from public coffers. The commission will use applicable laws to ensure that nobody is allowed to benefit from public resources. The counties were not made to kill the spirit of devolution,” she said without revealing those under investigations. UNETHICAL County Assemblies Forum (CAF) chairman Johnson Osoi said they are willing to cooperate with the commission to hand in whatever information is required to fast track investigations on any matter. “There is no justification in inefficiency and ineffectiveness in our oversight as county assemblies. The public is increasingly convinced that there are not consequences to corruption and unethical conducts. These concerns are genuine and we need them addressed,” he said. Mr Osoi, who is also the Kajiado County Speaker said there was need for collaboration between the commission and the individuals in promoting ethical conduct in tackling corruption in the counties. He urged the six counties mentioned by the commission to comply in the submission of the report.
