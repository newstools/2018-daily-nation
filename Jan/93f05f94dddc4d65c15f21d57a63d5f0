MOGADISHU Somalia Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire fired three key ministers on Thursday after weeks of political conflict with opposition and clan leaders.  Foreign Minister Yusuf Garad Omar, Trade Minister Khadra Ahmed Duale and Interior Minister Abdi Farah Said were all sent packing.  No reason was given for the reshuffle, but it came amid criticism that the government had failed to consult clan elders on their decisions.  They were replaced with men from their respective clans. Ahmed Ise Awad was named as new Foreign Minister, Abdi Mohamed Sabriye as the Interior Minster and Mohamed Abdi Hayr was appointed to head the Trade docket.  The government faces regular attacks from Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Shabaab militants.  The Al-Shabaab has been fighting to overthrow successive internationally backed governments since 2007, and frequently deploys car and truck bombs. In October, both the defence minister and army chief resigned and were replaced. The police and intelligence chiefs, sacked in October after the countryâ€™s deadliest attack killed 512 people, have yet to be replaced.
