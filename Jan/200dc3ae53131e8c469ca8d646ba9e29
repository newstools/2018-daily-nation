Hi Brenda, I’m 22 and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for six months. The problem is that he always wants me to sleep naked. At first I thought it was a phase, but then then the requests turned into demands and now it seems like he expects me to obediently follow him ‘commando’ commands. I don’t want to lose him but I feel like he may be a closet control freak and I may be setting myself up for problems in future…help? Well, there's nothing wrong with sleeping naked but there is everything wrong with him treating you like a child and playing army general. You should be allowed to say no, if you don't want to do it. You're spot on – he does sound like a control freak, and I think you already knew this – I think you were writing to confirm what you already knew as opposed to asking what to do. What now? Figure out if this is a deal breaker for you. Do you like being controlled? Can you see each other together long term? And is an underwear-less life really worth it? *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? E-mail: lifeandstyle@nationmedia.ke.com 
  
Since your ex-girlfriend was the one that broke off your relationship, she has no business knowing who you are dating.
