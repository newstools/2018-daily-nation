A child has died while two people have been injured in a grisly road crash at Mureru along the Nyeri-Nanyuki highway. The crash involving a truck, pick up and a saloon car occurred at around 2pm Wednesday, killing the toddler on the spot. According to witness accounts, the pick-up truck which was headed towards Nanyuki lost control and rammed into an oncoming saloon car. “The pickup seemed to lose control and hit the small vehicle that was going towards Naro Moru,” Mr Ben Mukangu, a witness said. The truck that was tailing the saloon car avoided crashing into the two and rolled into a ditch. Witnesses said they saw a woman and a child being thrown out of the pick up as it rolled onto the side of the road. The woman and the driver of the pickup were rushed to Nanyuki Hospital in critical condition. Occupants of the truck and the saloon car escaped unhurt during the crash. The vehicle wreckages were towed to the Naro Moru Police Station.
