It has now emerged that there was no agreement between the Nasa coalition parties to share the parliamentary committee positions as claimed by some affiliates. According to a document seen by Nation on Monday the only agreement between the principals was on the sharing of House leadership positions where all parties were to get at least a position each in the National Assembly and the Senate. This comes as the Nasa principals held a day-long meeting on Monday to, among other things, address complaints raised by Wiper Party last week over the sharing of parliamentary leadership positions. PARTY LEADER Several ODM lawmakers, who spoke in confidence so as not to interfere with the talks of their party leader and other principals, were shocked that Wiper was clinging to an agreement that never existed.A senior Orange MP, who clinched one of the parliamentary chair seats on Monday, confirmed that there was no agreement on the sharing of committee positions. “It was left to the members of the respective committees of both Nasa and Jubilee to elect their own leaders without any form of coercion or influence.” The MP dismissed the demand by Wiper that ODM cedes one position in the Parliamentary Service Commission to it. ODM “There is no reason for ODM to cede any PSC position. Any discussions should be held between ANC and Wiper as to who gets the senate PSC slot,” said another source in ODM. Wiper has claimed it was cheated out of a seat that was to go to Borabu MP Bernard Momanyi, who has complained bitterly about the changes. Despite ODM having 74 per cent of Nasa senators, it holds no position in the Senate, with Ford-K, with only one senator, taking minority leader position and Wiper, with three senators, taking the minority whip despite. Parliamentary positions are shared according to numerical strength. ODM, with 78 in the National Assembly and 20 in the Senate deserves 15 leadership positions but has only taken 12.
