Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang’, who led the “swearing-in” of Nasa leader Raila Odinga at Uhuru Park on Tuesday has been arrested. The MP was arrested Wednesday afternoon by plainclothes police officers outside the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi. He had just appeared before High Court judge George Odunga for a ruling in a case where he is representing MPs who are challenging the reduction of their salaries and allowances. Mr Kajwang’ and another lawyer, Miguna Miguna, were at the centre of events at Uhuru Park that culminated in the “swearing-in” of Mr Odinga as the "people’s president". During the ceremony, Mr Kajwang’ donned a lawyer's robe and wig and received a thunderous welcome by Nasa supporters. As Mr Odinga took the “oath”, Mr Kajwang’ stood right behind him, although his role remained unclear.   Raila Odinga took oath amidst cheer that turned into disappointment over Kalonzo’s absence.
