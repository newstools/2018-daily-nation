A woman stunned a Makueni court when she sought permission to bewitch a man accused of defiling her daughter. The court had adjourned the trial of Mr Dominic Musyoka, after a doctor, who was to testify in the defilement case of a 10-year-old girl, failed to turn up in court. The woman doubted the court's commitment on settling the case. The accused also complained that he had suffered following the delay in determining the matter. "The court should allow me to pursue this matter the Kikamba way," she said, prompting the magistrate, Mr Gerald Mutiso to seek clarification on what she meant. The prosecutor Mr Tito Wanga said the woman meant seeking services of a witchdoctor. Mr Wanga said he sought adjournment of the case after the doctor failed to show up because his evidence is crucial in the case. "This is the last adjournment," Mr Mutiso ruled as he said the matter will be heard on March 4. The suspect, who is a teacher in a local secondary school, is said to have defiled the girl on February 14 last year after enticing her with a soda. The incident took place at Machinery Market in Makueni County. The suspect is out on a Sh200, 000 bond.
