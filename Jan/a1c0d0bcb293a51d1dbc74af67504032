With the prize money in this year’s Barclays Kenya Open having been increased by 127 per cent from €220,000 (about Sh27.5m) to € 500,000 (Sh62.5m), the winner of this year’s event, set for March 22 to 25 at Muthaiga, will have a great chance of earning a European Tour card. Out  of the total prize money, the overall winner at Muthaiga this year will walk away with €80,000 (Sh10,160,000), while the second placed player will get €55,000 and the one following him €35,000. The fourth placed golfer will take home €30,000 almost the same as what England’s Aaron Rai won when he clinched the title in 2017. The lowest player at 60th place will win €1,550 (Sh196,850). The prize money increase at thus provides a great chance for professionals players to climb to the top 15 at the end of the season if they do well at Muthaiga. For a player to qualify for the main European Tour, one needs to earn at least €100,000 to finish at the top 15. With €80,000 on offer in the very first event of the season, a player may need to win one more tournament in the subsequent 28 events or at least make a five top 10 finish to earn enough money to gain promotion to the lucrative European Tour. “This has opened up a great opportunity for our local pros,’’ said Barclays Kenya Open tournament director Patrick Obath. Last year, the Challenge Tour Order of Merit winner Tapio Paulkkanen of Finland earned an impressive total of 210,799 Euro while the winner of the Barclays Kenya Open Aaron Rai who went on to claim two more events after Muthaiga, finished fourth overall in the Tour with a total of 139, 435 Euro. The 15th placed player Bradley Neil of Scotland earned 93, 168, very close to the total prize of this year’s Barclays Kenya Open. He played in 22 tournaments to earn that money. The top 15 players who qualified including Rai are  now featuring in the European Tour and may not come back to Muthaiga this year though the prize money is very tempting and it will not be a surprise for players like Rai coming back for another Kenya Open title attempt.   The Kenya Open was started in 1967.
