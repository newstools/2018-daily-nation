Mombasa Catholic Archbishop Martin Kivuva has said the church obeyed the will of Malindi Bishop Emanuel Barbara to be buried in Malta, Europe. Speaking at Central Primary School, he said the church consulted with John Cardinal Njue and the clergy. “Many people are wondering why he will not be buried here in the diocese like other bishops,” he said. The archbishop said Barbara had asked by word of mouth that he be buried in Malta. Bishop Barbara died in his sleep early this month. His body will be flown to Europe for burial on January 25.
