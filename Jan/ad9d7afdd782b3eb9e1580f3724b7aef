Two-time World Cross Country champion Geoffrey Kamworor crushed a strong field to win his fifth National Police Service Cross Country men's 10km race at the Ngong Racecourse on Saturday. Kamworor, who has set his sights on his third successive World Half Marathon title on March 24 in Valencia, Spain, swung to the lead after four kilometres before retreating to let guest athlete Noah Kipkemboi lead briefly after 6km in the two-horse thriller. Kamworor, christened the 'Man of All Surfaces, would then take charge heading into the final 2kms, reclaiming the title won last year to Augustine Choge in his absence in 29 minutes and 11.2 seconds. Kamworor won the Police race back-to-back from 2013 to 2016, missed to defend the title last year after he fell sick before cracking the whip on Saturday to reclaim the crown. "It gives me a good leverage ahead of my World Half Marathon title defence," said Kamworor, who was representing the Western team. The reigning New York City Marathon champion won the World Half Marathon title in 2014 Copenhagen and 2016 Cardiff. "I will only defend World Half Marathon and New York City Marathon titles this year," added Kamworor. Kipkemboi, who hails from Eldoret but trains in Iten, stated his case for employment at the Police Service with an impressive second place in 29:28.2. "It's great racing and testing my strength and capability against great athletes like Kamworor," said Kipkemboi. "I hope I will be able to secure employment with Police and more so represent Kenya for the first time." Josphat Bett from Central came in third in 29:32.5.
