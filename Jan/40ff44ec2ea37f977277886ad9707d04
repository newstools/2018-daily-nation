The ICC World Cricket League Division Two set for Windhoek, Namibia, from February 8 to 15 will offer Kenya their last chance of qualifying for the 2019 World Cup qualifiers. The qualifiers will be held in Zimbabwe from March 4 to 20. The Kenyan team left for Namibia on Wednesday via Zimbabwe where they will play against Zimbabwe “A” in a build up match. Kenya will also play one Twenty20 and four one day friendly matches. Kenya was demoted to World Cricket League Division Two when they finished fifth in the ICC world Cricket Championship that had eight teams that vied for the four slots reserved for the group in the Zimbabwe event. In Namibia six teams - Kenya, Canada, Oman, UAE, Nepal and the hosts will fight it out for the two places reserved for the Division Two in the World Cup qualifier. The World Cup will feature 10 teams. The top eight Test playing nations have automatic berths in the World Cup. England are among the top sides and also the host nation. There were 14 teams in the previous World Cup jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand in 2015. Commenting on the Namibia event, Kenya coach, Thomas Odoyo said: “The boys know the importance of finishing in top two in Namibia. We have prepared well and I expect them to do well.” The standard of Kenya cricket is at its ebb since Kenya was allocate one day international status in 1997 that they lost in 2014.
