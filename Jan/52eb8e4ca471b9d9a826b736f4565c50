AÂ fight between two groups at Jamhuri High School, Nairobi, on Tuesday night, in which seven students were seriously injured, is a stark reminder that we need to teach the youth the need for religious tolerance. The crucial education must begin at home and in places of worship. Expecting schools to do it alone is a tall order. This is necessary to stem the emerging threat to the religious harmony we have enjoyed for a long time. The Constitution outlaws discrimination along, among others, religious lines. Indeed, the legacy of a peaceful nation where the people can freely pursue their ambitions and enjoy all the rights, irrespective of their origins or religious beliefs, is one that makes us all proud to belong to this great country. It is what the senior citizens would wish to bequeath to the younger generation. MACHETES Many parents are baffled at how the machetes and knives got into the school. The culprits must be brought to book after investigations into the incident, whose victims were admitted to hospital with stab wounds. After all, being a minor is not a licence to commit a crime. Owing to the many challenges, including radicalisation of students and recruitment into terrorist groups, there is an urgent need to intensify security in learning institutions. School administrators must establish mechanisms to monitor these threats and liaise with security agencies on protection of students.
