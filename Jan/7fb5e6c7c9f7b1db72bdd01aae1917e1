National Police Service Spokesman Charles Owino has denied claims that three Nasa leaders Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula were under house arrest during the “swearing-in” ceremony of Mr Raila Odinga. The three did not attend the ceremony at Uhuru Park on Tuesday. Mr Owino said that he was not aware of such an action by the police but said that it was highly unlikely, terming the assertions by the leaders as political. "That is a political question and he (Kalonzo) has given you a political answer and I am apolitical and don't draw me to politics. “It is not true and he was not under house arrest," Mr Owino said. On the withdrawal of opposition leaders’ security, Mr Owino said he had no concrete information about the issue. "That I might not be able to answer here because I don't have information unless I get back to the office," he said. He also said that he was not aware whether Mr Musyoka's security detail had been reinstated following the Wednesday attack on his home. "I am not aware and I have not seen any policeman in his compound but I will be able to tell that when I am back [to] the office and contacted the authorities," said Owino.   Gunmen open fire outside Kalonzo's Karen home, hurl object into his compound.
