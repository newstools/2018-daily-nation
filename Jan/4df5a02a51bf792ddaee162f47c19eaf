A foreign report on the global status of freedom that is highly critical of the erosion of democracy in Kenya should not be ignored. However, it will not be surprising to hear its condemnation from the government, its functionaries and diehard supporters, as well as general endorsement from the opposition. This just goes to show how the country is split down the middle, especially following last year’s controversial presidential election. For the impartial observer, though, the report sums up the sorry situation that persists several months later. President Uhuru Kenyatta has been duly sworn in for his second and final five-year term, but all is not well. DISGRUNTLED The nearly half the population that supports his rival, Nasa leader Raila Odinga, is disgruntled. More worrying is the plan to swear in Odinga as the “people’s president”, prompting calls by foreign diplomats, the clergy, trade unionists and others for dialogue to avert a conflict. The report is based on a survey by the US-based Freedom House, a non-partisan non-governmental organisation critical of last year’s presidential poll. Kenya got an aggregate freedom score of 48 out of 100 points — a drop from 51 points the previous year — as Tanzania scored 52 points, down from 58 last year. This is not just constructive criticism but also vital feedback. The report should not be ignored.
