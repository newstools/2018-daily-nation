The Jubilee party has said it will not field its own candidate in the Kitui West parliamentary by-election to be held on March 26. Jubilee Party Secretary-General Raphael Tuju said the party supports Wiper's Edith Nyenze, the widow of the late Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze, in the upcoming poll. In a written statement Mr Tuju said, the decision was reached at Friday night after wide consultation within the Jubilee party. "It is appropriate and compassionate that the widow is granted a chance by the people of Kitui West to implement the development agenda championed by her late husband," the statement read. Mrs Nyenze won the Wiper party ticket on Wednesday. She garnered 13, 388 votes against her sole opponent in the party Maluki Kitili Mwendwa who got 2,663 votes.
