Property of unknown value was destroyed in Marsabit Town on Saturday after youth demonstrated following the arrest of a local sheikh by the Anti-Terrorism Police. Sheikh Guyo was arrested in the town centre and the youth, most of whom were his madrassa students, followed the sheikh and officers to the police station. But officers later drove them out of the police station. Police sources confirmed that the Anti-Terrorism Police arrested the sheikh.   PROPERTY As they went away, they destroyed property of KCB Bank and stormed into the Catholic Church, where they broke windows and chairs. They also beat up and injured the guard at the church. Police officers engaged in running battles with madrassah students and other youth who joined the protest. One protester was arrested at the Catholic Church, confirmed Marsabit OCS Charles Mwangi. The protesters also harassed a journalist who was covering the protests and destroyed his camera.   LOOTED A spot check by the Nation revealed that more property was destroyed after the youths stormed into people's businesses, looted them and set on fire some buildings and motorcycles. The Anti-Terrorism Police have not commented on the arrest. The sheikh was also arrested in 2014 at the Coast over suspicion of radicalising the youth, and was later released.  It was alleged that he had links to radical groups.
