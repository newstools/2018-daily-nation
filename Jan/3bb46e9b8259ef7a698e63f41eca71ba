Retail chain Tuskys has taken over shop space vacated by troubled Nakumatt Holdings in Kericho and Eldoret, growing its branch network to 63. Tuskys has revamped the combined space of 90,000 square feet at a cost of Sh220 million. It says the new outlet will stock household electronics, furniture and Mavazi lifestyle clothing among other items. Turkeys’ Eldo, located at the Eldo Centre Mall along the busy Uganda road is set to be the third largest store by the retailer in Uasin Gishu County. Tuskys Green Square supermarket at Green Square Mall in Kericho is also an addition to the existing Tuskys Nyando Branch located along Kenyatta Road.

The troubled retailer was last week placed under administration by the High Court in a move aimed at rescuing it from potential liquidation.
