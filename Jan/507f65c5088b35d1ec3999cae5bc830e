Transport has been paralysed along the Daraja Moja-Nyamataro road by-pass and the Nyambera-Marani road in Kisii Town after locals barricaded the roads due to their deplorable state. They erected concrete electric poles along the roads as they accused the national and county governments of ignoring the poor state of the roads. "We don't know what our MP Richard Onyonka is doing because we have not seen any major developments along thess roads. What is he doing to help the situation?" posed Mr Josephat Kiage, a boda boda rider. The protests caused a major traffic snarl-up along other roads including the busy Kisii-Kisumu highway resulting to a massive congestion at the Daraja Mbili market. "I have been forced to walk for over four kilometres because there were barricades all over the road and boda boda riders have hiked fares," said Mary Moraa. During the campaigns, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised that the road will be tarmacked.
