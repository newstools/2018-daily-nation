A prisoner convicted of robbery with violence has escaped from the Migori Prison. He slipped out through the fence and disappeared into the adjacent thickets early on Sunday. SURRENDER Two other prisoners who tried to escape with him were arrested near River Migori after a ten-minute chase. Prison warders fired shots into the air several times in a bid to scare the escapees and force them to surrender. The correctional centre is under 24-hour security surveillance and it remained unclear how the inmates escaped from the facility. Migori County police chief Joseph Nthenge said the escaped convict was serving a life sentence. “We have launched investigations to establish under what circumstances the trio escaped in broad daylight. Thereafter, we will take necessary action,” he stated. “We are still looking for the third convict and appealing to members of the public to help us in apprehending him.” PANIC The incident caused panic among border town residents, who have not heard gunshots since the end post-election protests. “At first, I thought police were pursuing robbers only to learn later they were chasing escaping prisoners,” said Mr Luke Owiny. Security was immediately beefed up within the prisons, which has both male and female wings. Warders who were on duty during the escape recorded statements with the authorities.
