Employees of a private school in Homa Bay County were left in shock after their boss committed suicide allegedly for not having a nanny to look after his baby. Workers at Agape Academy in Suba South Sub-County woke up to the bizarre incident Monday when their employer, Samuel Omuga aged 44, hanged himself after his wife left him. The man’s wife left home in Uterere Sub-Location for studies at a college in the county. The man left a note to his mother informing her of the troubles he would have undergone with the baby. He said in the note that he could not withstand all the problems of taking care of the minor by himself. Assistant Chief William Kisima said Mr Omuga was a teacher at Muiraria Primary School. "He is a teacher employed by the Teachers Service Commission. He lives in and owns his own private school where he committed suicide," said Mr Kisima. Trouble started after he took back his wife to college. COMPLAINED TO MOTHER Mr Kisima said he complained to his mother that he could not take care of his baby and at the same time concentrate on teaching and managing his private school. "He asked his mother to look for a nanny for him. They disagreed over the idea, which angered him," said the chief. Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum said Mr Omuga killed himself in his house. Mr Tum said the man had two children. "It is unfortunate that the man had to leave behind such a young family. We are investigating why he had to kill himself," he said. The police boss said the man’s body was taken to Sori Lake Side mortuary for post-mortem. Elsewhere, a 15-year-old pupil committed suicide in Wiga Village in Kanyach Kachar Location in Homa Bay Town Sub-County. Stephen Oluoch killed himself at their home over unknown reasons. His step-father Paul Odhiambo said the minor did not leave a suicide. Mr Tum urged Homa Bay residents to share their problem as the first step of looking for solutions.
