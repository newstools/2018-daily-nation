Teachers Service Commission has decried the high rate  of failure in teachers training colleges across the country in the past few years. Speaking at Meru Teachers Training College during the institution’s its 79th graduation ceremony, TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia raised concern about high number of referrals and fails in TTCs. She said if the cases are not addressed , the country will soon have a shortage of teachers. “I am really worried about what is happening in our colleges. I am informed that even though most students have  graduated today, we had 145 referrals and four failures in this college,” Ms Macharia said. REFERRALS She said one college had 287 referrals in 2016 and asked all stakeholders in the education sector to find a way of solving the problem. The CEO also issued a stern warning to teachers who are practising without TSC registration numbers. “All teachers must be registered with the TSC whether practising in public or private schools. Those found teaching without a registration number will be sued,” she added. Ms Macharia asked those graduating to be patient as the service finds out the best procedure of employing them. EMPLOYING TEACHERS She added that they will either consider employing teachers who have stayed for long without employment or consider those who performed well. On the teachers who are facing hostility in their new work stations after transfers, Ms Macharia said the commission will support them to settle in the new schools. “We will support all teachers who have been transferred and especially those who are facing hostility. “Change is inevitable and  parents and teachers must embrace,” she said.   Dr Kipsang asks principals of the institutions to conduct a postmortem on the results.
