LIVERPOOL Liverpool will offer supporters who bought shirts bearing the name of Philippe Coutinho a £50 (56.4 euro) voucher to help offset the impact on fans of the Brazilian's move to Barcelona. The 25-year-old star, who had agitated for a move away from Anfield since last summer, finally got his wish on Saturday when the two clubs agreed a deal worth 160 million euros ($192 million, Sh19.2 billion). "The club is to offer supporters who bought a 2017-18 replica shirt printed with Philippe Coutinho's name and number a £50 voucher, once the move is completed," said a statement from Liverpool. "Supporters should present their 2017-18 Coutinho replica shirt at any official club store where the voucher will be issued. The shirt will not be retained but proof of purchase will be required." 
  
Coutinho is expected to watch his new team host Levante on Sunday afternoon at Camp Nou.
