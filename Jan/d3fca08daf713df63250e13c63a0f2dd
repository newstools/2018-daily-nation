Police in Migori have impounded bhang worth Sh5 million from a motorist as they vowed to intensify traffic inspection. Migori County Administration Police Commandant Julius Mukanda said the police manning a road block along the Migori-Isebania highway seized the drugs after a tip-off from members of the public. TRAFFICKING “We got information about the trafficking from Tanzania through Serengeti to Ikerege in Kenya then through Migori Town,” Mr Mukanda said. He said the Toyota Probox was spotted in Ikerege in Kuria West Sub-County where it was monitored before a chase ensued. “We gave chase from Namba junction on the outskirts of Migori Town, to Masara then Nyatike,” Mr Mukanda said. “Nyatike roads, being majorly rough roads, and our vehicles being better equipped for the terrain, the driver and another man who were in the vehicle abandoned their vehicle and disappeared.” CHASE The AP boss said during the chase, the driver of the Probox lost control of the vehicle and hit a woman. “The woman was rushed to Migori County Referral hospital but as we speak, we have received information that she has been treated and discharged,” he said. In the vehicle the police found a printout of a Global Positioning System (GPS) map with the path the drivers were to use clearly mapped out. “The map shows that this consignment was headed for Meru through Migori from Tanzania,” Mr Mukanda said. ILLEGAL He said they had initiated investigations to identify the owner of the vehicle and the consignment. Migori County Commissioner Joseph Rotich said police had taken measures to deal with anybody found dealing in illegal goods. “We are also conducting raids on illicit brew and illegal gaming joints and we will fight so that our children get a conducive environment for growing up,” Mr Rotich said. He asked members of the public to cooperate with the police in fighting illegal activities.
