Higher Education regulator has deferred a decision on whether to drop or retain a requirement demanding that only PhDs holders teach in universities by the end of this year. Commission for University Education (CUE) chairman Chacha Nyaigoti Chacha said the decision has been postponed in order to allow room for more negotiations. “Commissioners met on Monday and deliberated on the issue at length. However, we agreed to consult further and hope that next week on Monday, we will declare our position on it,” said Prof Chacha. There have been growing concerns over the small pool of professors in the country putting to question the implementation of the guidelines. In 2014, the regulator gave universities five years to implement the rule requiring that lecturers must have doctorates. Lecturers with master’s degrees were reduced to tutorial or junior research fellows, commonly referred to as teaching assistants. A report on university audit released last year highlighted delays in student progression, especially at postgraduate level.
