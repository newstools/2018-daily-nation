Four students of Jamhuri High School have been charged over a brawl at the institution last week following allegations of religion discrimination. The four boys denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi and were each released on a Sh20,000 bond. They were charged with assaulting and causing bodily harm to Sayid Osman Abdullahi and Hohamed Idris Mohamed on January 23. At least 35 students were reported injured. They allegedly committed the offences at Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company offices on Murang’a Road, Starehe Sub-County. CONTINUE STUDIES They appeared in court together with their parents and pleaded to be allowed to continue with their studies, a request the chief magistrate agreed to. “I kindly request the court to allow us to finish our studies, we are candidates and we promise to avail ourselves whenever we are needed in court for this case,” said one student on behalf of the rest. On the fateful day, a Form Two Muslim day scholar was allegedly slapped by a Christian prefect for using a cup belonging to boarding students.
