The defeats to South Africa, New Zealand and West Indies in the group matches highlights Kenya’s struggles at the Under-19 Cricket World Cup that is under way in New Zealand. Even though the junior national team is ranked fourth on the continent, after South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, these results imply that there is more work to be done if these youngsters are to eventually make the grade in the international arena. It is, therefore, important for Cricket Kenya to set up a programme to continue nurturing these talents. EXPOSURE On this front, plans should be established in collaboration with the government to not only train but also give these players exposure to other international competitions. President Uhuru Kenyatta’s recent pledge to build a world-class international cricket stadium are also welcome as these players require the requisite infrastructure to develop their skills. Kenya’s potential in this sport is well known. The senior men’s national team’s heroics at the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup are well documented. Then, senior players such as Maurice Odumbe and Steve Tikolo fired the country into the semi-finals of the tournament, ensuring Kenya was marketed abroad and local stars able to earn a living out of playing cricket.   The federation should set up a programme to continue nurturing talent.
