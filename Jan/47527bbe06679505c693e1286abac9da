The 2017 Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year Award (Soya) Gala went down on Wednesday in Nairobi with double Paralympics and World Para Athletics champion Samwel Mushai being declared the overall winner. Mushai became the only other para-athlete, besides Henry Wanyoike, to be crowned Kenya’s finest sports personality. Mushai’s achievement is a clear indication that one can achieve anything in life with hard work and discipline. Mushai detailed the hardships the disabled athletes go through, including lack of facilities and sponsorship. CRUCIAL ISSUES Former Harambee Stars captain Mike Okoth and guest of honour Deputy President William Ruto touched on crucial issues. Okoth talked of sports in the school curriculum, while Ruto announced government’s investment in sports to the tune of Sh4.5 billion for the renovation and construction of five stadia, plus Sh500 million for top performing sports personalities. A similar amount has been set aside for sports federations and teams that have suffered after SportPesa withdrew its support. Kenyans need quality facilities and it is our hope that the ongoing work at several stadia will be hastened.
