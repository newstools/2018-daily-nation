Machakos County Governor Dr Alfred Mutua has expressed concern over the scheduled swearing in of Nasa principals Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka  terming it a recipe for chaos. Dr Mutua, in a press briefing on Friday, said the country cannot have two presidents. "This talk of two presidents is bad for the nation. We are going to have another shithole country," he said mimicking US President Donald Trump's description of African countries early this month. He said politics should be geared towards achieving development and not scaring away investors. "Those pushing  for the swearing in have accumulated property unlike the millions of poor Kenyans. "I urge our friends to please forget about this shenanigans and work towards developing our country, " said Dr Mutua. He likened the swearing-in to the planting of seeds of civil war which would turn the  nation into another Somalia and Sudan. "This talk of swearing in is not only bad for our people but makes us look bad to the international community. "If other people out there hear that Kenya is having another swearing-in so that we have two presidents, they will look at us and will say there goes another failed nation," Dr Mutua said.
