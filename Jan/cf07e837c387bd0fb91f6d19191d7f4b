The High Court in Kisumu has upheld the election of Kisumu Woman Representative Rozah Buyu. Lady Justice Tripsisa Cherere dismissed an election petition filed by Citizen Conventions party leader Mrs Grace Akumu challenging Mrs Buyu's August win. The judge admitted there was evidence of some irregularities committed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries commission (IEBC), but she said they could not have altered the final result. Mrs Akumu was slapped with Sh3 million litigation costs. The petitioner said that she will not be filing an appeal to challenge the ruling following what she termedÂ  'exorbitant costs' that she was slapped with. "I spent a lot during the campaigns and therefore lack resources to appeal. It is sad that even as the courts found that there were irregularities, the case was dismissed and I was told to bear the cost," said Mrs Akumu.
