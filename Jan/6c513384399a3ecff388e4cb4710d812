Local league enthusiasts will get to enjoy live coverage of Kenyan Premier League matches this year if talks between the Kenyan Premier League Limited (KPL) and a yet-to-be-revealed international broadcasting company end positively. Nation Sport has authoritatively learned that negotiations between KPL and the foreign pay television channel are at an advanced stage with the view of having top flight games back on television before June this year. The main point of discussion, Nation Sport understands, is KPL’s insistence that the foreign broadcast company engages a local free-to-air company to ensure that the live games reach the widest audience possible. The challenge, however, is that none of the major local television stations have publicly expressed any interest in acquiring the free-to-air rights for local league games. Addressing this issue, outgoing KPL chairman Dan Aduda on Tuesday confirmed that KPL’s agreement with Spanish production company Media Pro is still intact.
