A church and security agencies in Kisumu County have clashed over claims that mentally ill patients were illegally chained its main headquarters in the lakeside city. Some of the men had their legs chained while others were chained at the hands. The clergymen said they were thus restrained because they had been violent and were attacking people. On Thursday, the Coptic Church leader Father John Pesa I said they were being held on their families’ volition. “It was unfortunate for the police to raid my church on January 12 over such unsubstantiated claims," said Father Pesa. “In fact we are demanding an apology from them because they illegally forced access, wearing their boots into our sanctuary which is a holy place. They must be ready to cleanse the place.” On January 12, Kisumu East Deputy County Commissioner Josephine Ouko led police officers in the raid but did not make any arrest. Speaking to Journalists on Thursday, Ms Ouko said the police were investigating the matter. She however, denied claims that officers harassed the faithful during their raid. “We received information that people were being held at his Church against their will and subjected to inhumane conditions, " added Ms Ouko. She pointed out that they were accompanied by officers from the Health department and physiatrists to examine the patients. In 2010, the church was sued over similar allegations but later exonerated by a court.
