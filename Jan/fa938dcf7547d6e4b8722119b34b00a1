Hi, I am Kiaz, 41, married and working away from my family for the last five years. I usually come home at least once a year. My main concern is this habit I developed when I began working abroad: masturbation. How can I quit? I am ready to try anything as I am unable to stop on my own.  Dear Kiaz, Most men masturbate. In fact, it is said to be healthy to masturbate every so often. I am sure it must be hard for you, being away from home, but I need more information about your problem. Why do you masturbate and how often? Why do you think you should stop? Do you masturbate because you are bored, or because you miss being intimate with our wife? Do you need to fill up your days with more activities so you are not left in the house to your own devices? Perhaps it is time to consider coming home more often as well, maybe up to twice or thrice a year. If you do want to stop for other reasons, such as you feel like it is unhealthy or your performance sexually is being affected, there are a lot of online programs that help men do that, which I can refer you to after you give me more details. Let me know. Thanks!   What would you do if you found out that your partner masturbates regularly behind your back?
