Safaricom has cut mobile data charges for its Internet-enabled digital television decoders in a bid to beat off competition in the home Internet space. The cut of up to 53 per cent in mobile broadband prices under two new bundles is also seen as a strategy to grow sales of repackaged Android-powered digital TV decoders. The decoders were silently relaunched last November, two years after they were pulled out for upgrade as sales flattened at 1,500 devices in the first seven months. It was then selling under BIGBox brand. Safaricom is charging Sh3,500 for 30 Gigabytes (GB) under Easy30 bundle for 30 days and Sh6,000 for 50GB under Easy50 package, which expires in 45 days. Customers who still use BIGBox can also buy monthly home bundles at Sh3,199 for 15GB and Sh1,199 for 5GB under the new offering. “The new Easy bundles have been designed with the needs of the modern Kenyan family in mind,” Safaricom’s director for strategy and a co-acting chief executive Joseph Ogutu said in a statement.
