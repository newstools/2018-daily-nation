Acting Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has revoked the operation license of Presbyterian University of East Africa. Dr Matiang’i has directed the Commission for University Education (CUE) to start the process of winding up the University in line with the provisions of the Universities Act and Universities regulations. The decision follows the recommendations made by the CUE. Dr Matiang’i made the decision in a letter addressed to CUE chairman Chacha Nyaigoti Chacha. In a report to the CS dated January 22, CUE recommended that the letter of interim authority awarded to the university in 2007 be revoked. The report says staff at the university were on salaries arrears spanning two years and the institution has unpaid arrears on salaries and allowances amounting to Sh611 million. “The university had defaulted on remittance of staff salaries, deduction to financial institutions, leading to some staff members being listed at credit reference bureau,” reads the report. It says the university lacked adequate resources to meet its obligations given the deficit realised in the four years under review which includes; 2012/2013, 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2015/2016 financial years. The report adds that at the School of Education, one academic leader did not have requisite qualifications in the field of education and most of the staff records did not have copies of academic certificates. “Salary structure were reported to be too high others too low. The employees lacked medical insurance despite the fact that it was provided for in terms and condition of service. It was established that there was a medical cover by Britam up to 2015,” says the report. The university was found to run seven degree programmes and 27 non-degree programmes. The report adds that in 2017/2018, students enrolled in degree programmes were 1, 032 while diploma, certificate and pre-university programmes were 359. The ratio of full time staff (56) to part time (33) academic staff members was found to be approximately 2:1 (1:6:1). PUEA first admitted students in 2008 after it was issued with a letter of interim on August 10, 2007, it was yet to get a charter.   Fate of Presbyterian University of East Africa now lies in the hands of Education CS Matiang’i.
