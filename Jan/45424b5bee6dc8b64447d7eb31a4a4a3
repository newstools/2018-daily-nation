Harambee Stars striker Michael Olunga on Saturday became the first Kenyan player to score in the Spanish La Liga after bagging a hat-trick in Girona's 6-0 rout of Las Palmas at the Estade de Montilivi. The lanky Kenyan striker netted three times in 23 minutes of the second half as Girona moved into ninth place with the thumping victory over bottom-placed Las Palmas. Olunga also became the first Girona player to net a hat-trick in Spain's top division. Olunga played a starring role as the Catalan side, in their debut season in Spain's top flight, recorded their biggest victory at this level. Girona were ahead at half-time through a Cristhian Stuani penalty when Olunga — used sparingly since joining on loan from the Chinese club Guizhou Zhicheng at the start of the season — was sent on for the second half in place of the Uruguayan. The 23-year-old promptly turned in a Johan Mojica cross to double Girona's lead, and he was then involved in the build-up to Borja Garcia's goal. Shocking Las Palmas defending allowed Olunga in to make it 4-0 before he set up Portu for the fifth goal. Hardly able to believe his luck, he was then left with an easy finish to complete his hat-trick 11 minutes from the end — three goals in 23 minutes and the first ever hat-trick by a Girona player in La Liga.
