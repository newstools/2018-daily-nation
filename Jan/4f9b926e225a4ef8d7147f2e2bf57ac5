A man has been jailed for life for defiling a 10-year-old girl in Kakamega County two years ago. Maurice Amita was convicted after the court found him guilty of committing the offence on June 20, 2015 at Msiaji village. “The prosecution has discharged its case beyond reasonable doubt and therefore I find the accused guilty,” ruled Senior Resident Magistrate Erick Malesi.
