A Japanese contractor has won the tender for the second phase of dualling of Nairobi’s Ngong Road from Prestige Plaza to Dagoretti Corner. The 2.42-kilometre stretch will be built at a cost of Sh2.3 billion. World Kogyo Kaihatsu (WKK) has estimated it will take two years to dual the road. WKK is the same contractor that was involved in building the stretch between Kenya National Library Service and Prestige Plaza into a dual carriageway, the first phase of the road expansion plan. It was funded through a Sh1.4 billion grant from the Japanese government. “The dualling of Ngong Road Phase two from Prestige Plaza to Dagoretti Corner is set to start in early March. The section was awarded to World Kogyo Kaihatsu construction company on 25th January, 2018, at a cost of Sh2.3 billion, which is a grant from Japanese government,” said Kenya Urbans Roads Authority director general Silas Kinoti.

The design also provides for the inclusion of a special bus lane to be used exclusively by public service buses without interfering with normal traffic flow, under the rapid bus transit system. Intelligent traffic lights at major intersections are the other special feature expected on the road. The smart lights at junctions will allow a longer period of traffic flow from roads with most vehicles as opposed to the current analogue lights that are time-based, restricted to allow and stop vehicles at intervals. Ngong Road, which is notorious for traffic snarl-ups, has been planned for expansion in three phases.
