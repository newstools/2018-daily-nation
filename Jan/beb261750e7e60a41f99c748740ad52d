Kenya’s top seeded table tennis players Sejal Thakkar and Brian Mutua will use next month’s ITTF Continental Cup in Nairobi to fine-tune for April’s Commonwealth Games in Australia. The finest players from 30 African countries converge on Nairobi for the ITTF Continental Cup that will double up as the 2019 World Table Tennis Championships qualifier. The tournament will be staged at Kasarani from March 1-3. The Commonwealth Games will be held from April 4 to 15 in Gold Coast while the 2019 World Table Tennis Championships will be held in Budapest, Hungary. The 42-year-old Thakkar has represented Kenya twice at the Commonwealth Games, making her debut in 1998 (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) before competing again in 2014 (Glasgow, Scotland). Mutua, 19, will be representing Kenya for the second time. The two were among guests at Monday’s launch of the ITTF Continental Cup at Nairobi’s Panafric Hotel where Kenya Table Tennis Association President Andrew Mudibo said they require Sh20 million to host tournament. “Preparations are in top gear with several sponsors having come on board, including the government that has pledged to take up of three quarters of the budget,” said Mudibo adding that their main worry is clearing the equipment from the International Table Tennis federation that are expected on February 17. “Some of the cash will be used to clear the equipment but we shall be happy if the government is to waive the tax since it’s a donation from the ITTF,” Mudibo said. Egyptian Assar Omar, who is currently the highest ranked Africa player in the world in 16th place, is among top players expected alongside Nigerians Aruna Quadri, who is placed 20th in the world and Segun Toriola. Egyptian Dina Meshref, who is best placed African in the world in 39th position, and Nigerian Olufunke Oshonaike are players to watch in the women’s battle.
