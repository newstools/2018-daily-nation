A 92-year-old woman has denied selling her 5.3 acres in Kilgoris, Narok County, to world athletics champion David Rudisha. Ms Nashuru Muriango Wednesday told a Narok court that she never received any money from the 800m champion or entered into any agreement with him over the sale of the land. She was testifying during the hearing of a case on the ownership of the parcel of land. Mr Rudisha has sued Ms Muriango and wants the court to compel her to move out of the land arguing that he bought it on September 23, 2015. NOWHERE TO GO But the 92-year-old woman, who was represented by Nairobi-based McKay advocates, told Justice Kullow Mohamed that her wish was to be buried on the land and she does not have anywhere else to go. Responding during cross-examination by Mr Rudisha’s lawyer, Philemon Ochuang’i, the granny told the court she never met Mr Rudisha or his agents or signed any agreement. “I have not sold my land to anybody. I live there and only death will make me leave the land, and I have instructed my children that I will be buried there,” she said in court. STRUCK DEAL But Mr Rudisha argued that his brother, Mr Benson Rudisha, and the granny’s grandson Franklin Naiguran helped him strike the land deal with the woman in 2015. Mr Rudisha said he deposited Sh1.3 million in an account belonging to Mr Naiguran’s wife of, Ms Silvia Naiguran, after his brother represented him in signing a sale agreement prepared by Mr Banjamin Musyoki, a clerk at Jumba and Company Advocates, in Kilgoris Town. The three mentioned in the deal are facing criminal charges at the Kilgoris Law Courts in connection to the same case. They have been accused of fraud. However, Justice Mohamed said the court will summon Mr Musyoki to come and shed more light on who signed the agreement after the woman’s lawyers argued that it was fraudulent. Hearing will resume on March 7.
