Deputy President William Ruto has sent condolences to the family of his police outrider, who died on Saturday morning while travelling in the DP's motorcade. Constable Casmel Ndege was riding ahead of Mr Ruto when he lost control of his motorbike on Wangari Maathai Road in Nairobi. On his Twitter account, the DP said: "Deepest condolences to the family and friends of Constable Casmel Ndege who has passed on in the line of duty. He was a gallant, hardworking and dedicated professional." He added: "We celebrate him for his selfless service to this country. May his Soul Rest In Peace."   The DP's motorcade was travelling to Githunguri, Kiambu County, where he attended a burial.  Mr Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta are usually escorted by police motorbikes when on official duties around the country.  The escort team is drawn from the elite presidential escort.
