LONDON Ben Stokes will now be considered for England selection despite being charged with affray, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Wednesday. Stokes was suspended from international duty by the ECB following his involvement in an incident outside a nightclub in September that reportedly left a man with a fractured eye socket. As a result, Stokes missed the whole of England's 4-0 Ashes series defeat in Australia. Stokes was charged by prosecutors on Monday but the ECB said that given his intention to contest the charge and the potential length of time to trial, "it would not be fair, reasonable or proportionate for Ben Stokes to remain unavailable for a further indeterminate period".   India lost seven wickets in an extended morning's play.
