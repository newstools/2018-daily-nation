George Clooney will act in a new TV series "Catch-22" and receive about $1 million per episode. He will also produce and co-direct the limited series will be just six episodes long, says Amy Powell, president of Paramount Television -- the studio producing the show along with Anonymous Content. This will be the American actor's first regular television role since he left "ER" nearly two decades ago. Negotiations to stream the series via the online platform Hulu are under way, a source close to the matter told AFP, confirming several US media reports. The show is an adaptation of Joseph Heller's 1961 novel of the same name, which centers on a squadron of World War II airmen facing a no-win situation to return home. It will be the actor's first recurring role on television since his run on the primetime medical drama show "ER," which launched him to celebrity in the nineties. Clooney played the doctor Doug Ross before leaving the show in 1999 to embark on his ultimately successful film career. He made a few cameo appearances later on, notably in 2009 for the fifteenth and final season. In December 2017, Fortune Magazine reported that the net worth of the two-time Oscar winner stood at $500 million.   He said he and his wife Amal had "decided to be a lot more responsible and avoid danger".
