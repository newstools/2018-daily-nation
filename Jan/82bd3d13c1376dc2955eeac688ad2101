LONDON Chelsea signed France striker Olivier Giroud from London rivals Arsenal on Wednesday's transfer deadline day, freeing up Michy Batshuayi to leave Stamford Bridge on loan to German side Borussia Dortmund. Premier League champions Chelsea revealed on their website that Giroud had signed an 18-month contract, with the 31-year-old saying: "Chelsea is one of the biggest teams in the Premier League. They have won maybe the most trophies in the last six or seven years. "It's a massive club and I am proud to sign for Chelsea, and I'm looking forward to playing."   Dortmund have eyed up a six-month loan move for Belgian international Michy Batshuayi.
