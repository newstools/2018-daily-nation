A Homa Bay magistrate has withdrawn from a case in which Suna East MP Junet Mohamed has been accused of perpetrating hate speech. Homa Bay Principal Magistrate Susan Ndegwa did not give a detailed reason as to why she would not preside over the case. “I also disqualify myself from the case due to personal reasons,” said Ms Ndegwa. Mr Mohammed was arraigned in a Homa Bay court on July 21 last year. The MP was accused of uttering words which contravened the National Cohesion and Integrity Act at a political gathering attended by Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho, Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga and other leaders. The offence was allegedly committed at an Orange Democratic Movement party youth meeting in Homa Bay town. He was accused of asking Mr Joho to prepare grounds in Mombasa where the swearing in of Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga will be conducted, a move which could have seen the opposition leader become president of certain parts of the country except Central region. He was released on a cash bail of Sh100,000 or a bond of Sh500,000 with surety of similar amount. Ms Ndegwa scheduled the case for mention on January 26, 2017. The case will also be reallocated to another magistrate on that day.
