Toyota Tsusho Fertiliser Africa has started a promotion to boost sales of its locally blended NPK fertiliser. The Japanese conglomerate is running a show dubbed Baraka Kibao Bonanza to create awareness of its brand and boost sales, at a time of increased competition in the market from subsidised government fertiliser and other local players. The promo that will run for three months — from today to April 22 — will see farmers, agro dealers and agrovets stand a chance to win tractors, motorbikes and a car. “The main objective of this bonanza is to reward loyal Baraka Fertiliser customers and to encourage farmers to adopt the Baraka range of fertiliser formulations,” said Timothy Chege, managing director of the firm.

There will be mobile phone prizes too while agro-dealers stand to win a Toyota Probox. To participate, one has to buy a 50 kilogramme bag of Baraka fertiliser. Farmers will participate by scratching a card to be found in every bag of fertiliser and sending the secret code to the firm at no cost.
