Jubilee Party wants the Opposition to take its oversight role seriously now that it has full representation in Parliament. National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale said with the minority leadership representation in both houses, Nasa should hold the government accountable for its performance and use of public resources in the next five years. Mr Duale said Jubilee considers scrutiny by the Opposition crucial as President Uhuru Kenyatta serves his second and final term in office.  “Parliament will also play a key role in the vetting of Cabinet nominees and the filling of constitutional commissions. Both sides have a role to play to unite the country,” said Mr Duale who spoke in his office during a briefing with US Ambassador Robert Godec. The National Assembly is yet to receive the names of three cabinet nominees – Mr John Munyes, Mr Ukur Yatani and Mr Keriako Tobiko – for vetting but Mr Duale said this will be done next week. But National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi has refused to name opposition MPs to Parliament’s Committee on Appointments, saying his side of the House is of the view that the appointing authority of the Cabinet – the President – is absent. Nasa has said it does not recognise Mr Kenyatta as president and his election was illegitimate. Mr Godec continued with the push for dialogue. “There are issues that clearly emerged out of the last elections and there are opportunities in dealing with them in the coming days,” he said.
