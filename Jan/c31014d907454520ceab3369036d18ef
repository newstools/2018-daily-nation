The coastal region is in the grip of serious disease outbreaks. The people afflicted by chikungunya and dengue fever, which have been ravaging Mombasa County for several months deserve urgent assistance and need not be subjected to a political blame game. Itâ€™s quite surprising that Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu is not leading a campaign to deal with this grave threat. To the suffering people, it does not matter who is to blame. All they want is relief from the diseases. So, instead of blaming Mombasa Governor Joho for the spread of diseases at the coast, he should be working closely with the local leadership to find a solution to the problem. DIRTY According to the CS, the town is dirty, with heaps of uncollected garbage making it vulnerable to the diseases. But the national government cannot just leave the people to suffer because their local leaders have failed to discharge its duties. We have had cholera cases reported in Nairobi, should the governor also have been blamed for this? After all, the ministry has an overarching national responsibility in the prevention and cure of diseases, besides formulation of policy. Whenever the health of Kenyans is at stake, we must forget the side shows and fully focus on tackling the matter at hand. And there is no better authority to lead such a campaign than the Health ministry.
