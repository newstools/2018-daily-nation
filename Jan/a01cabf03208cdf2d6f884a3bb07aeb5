Team Royal Salute on Saturday stormed into the final of the Chairman’s Cup tournament after beating Samurai 4.5-4 at the Nairobi Polo Club in Jamhuri. Nineteen-year-old Natasha Tisminiesky was the toast of the match, as she swept in two goals in the second and fourth chukkas to gift Salute the victory they needed to grace Sunday’s final. Anthony Wahome and Jamie Hayward complemented her efforts with a goal each in the second chukka to seal the victory for Salute who had started with a fraction due to their inferior collective handicap. The Samurai quartet of Raphael Nzomo 2.5, Hiromi Nzomo 0, Jadini Nzomo -1 and Amani Nzomo -1 started strongly, and they took an early lead with an easy field goal from captain Raphael, who is the head of the family team and also the Nairobi Polo Club captain. They however failed to continue on that path as their opponents dominated the second and third chukkas. Teenage sensation Jadini however converted a penalty in the second quarter, but this proved insufficient against Royal Salute who seemed to get better with every chukka. “We lacked unity in the second chukka and this was only because most of my team’s horses became tired. I was using the tournament to test some of my newly acquired ponies that I’m currently schooling for some high-profile tournaments and in that I have succeeded," Nzomo said after the match. Royal Salute will now meet defending champions MICT (Mombasa Island Cargo Terminal) in Sunday’s final. MICT beat Space and Style 2-1 and R.J Polo 3.5-2 to make it to the final for the second consecutive time.
