The government plans to make former vice-president Michael Kijana Wamalwa’s burial place a national monument. The graveside in Kitale, Trans Nzoia County, will become a heritage site to preserve historical artefacts of his Baengele clan. The burial committee for the late VP’s widow Yvonne Wamalwa, which comprises clan members, said the move will preserve Wamalwa’s legacy. “Talks are under way with the National Museums of Kenya to turn the graveside into a mausoleum,” said Mr Wanjala Jumbe, the committee chairman. “It will be similar to that of Koitalel arap Samoei in Nandi Hills.” NMK Kitale curator Kizili Cole said at the Wamalwas’ Milimani Estate home on Monday the proposal has been approved and gazettement initiated. “I thank the family for enlarging the parcel of land for that purpose,” said Mr Kizili. Baengele clan chairman Charles Kisembe said Yvonne will be buried next to her husband’s grave on Saturday.   Widow of former Vice President Michael Wamalwa Kijana passes on.
