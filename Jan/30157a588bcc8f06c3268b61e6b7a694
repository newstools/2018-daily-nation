A woman was burnt to death while her husband was shot and injured when thugs invaded their home in Nyamira County on Friday night. The criminals broke into the couple’s house in Miruka, West Mugirango Constituency, prompting Mr Sam Nyakundi to hide in the ceiling while his wife Pauline Kwamboka sought refuge in a store. ATTACK As the thugs searched for them, Mr Nyakundi came out of his hiding and dashed to his car in an attempt to escape but he was shot in the neck. However, the injury did not deter him from driving off to Nyamira Police Station, about 20km away, where he reported the incident before he was taken to hospital by OCS Alex Mumo. By the time police arrived at the home, the raiders had fled. Nyamira County Police Commander Titus Karuri said the thugs set ablaze the family house and Ms Kwamboka was burnt. “We are trying to establish the motive of the attack as the raiders did not steal anything from the home,” he said.
