The Kenya Pipeline Company on Thursday announced plans to build a modern training ground and indoor volleyball arena. KPC managing director Joe Sang explained that the construction of this facility will commence in earnest after the project was approved by the company’s board of directors. Sang spoke on Thursday at a breakfast meeting in honour of the dominant Kenya Pipeline women’s volleyball team which has won the Kenya Volleyball Federation women’s league for the past four seasons. Also in attendance at this meet held at the Panari hotel was National Olympic Committee President Paul Tergat and his deputy Waithaka Kioni, who is also the Kenya Volleyball Federation chairman. Sang also handed each of the team’s 30 players and technical bench members a comprehensive medical cover and advised the players to plan on how to survive after their playing careers end. “I am told the facility you use for training is not in very good shape, and especially when it rains so we are going to put up a modern one,” said Sang.“This is the best news we have received in a while,” added Kioni. Pipeline coach Japheth Munala, who doubles up as the national women volleyball team, also welcomed the decision to put up the facility. The veteran trainer also expressed optimism her charges will win the continental title this year for the first time in more than a decade. Pipeline will alongside arch rivals Kenya Prisons represent the country at the Africa Club Championship set for Cairo in March. Despite having some of the continent’s star players namely Janet Wanja, captain Triza Atuka, left handed attacker Violet Makuto, Noel Murambi, Monica Biama and Ruth Jepngetich in their ranks, Pipeline who boast five continental titles, have only managed two semi-final finishes in their last three campaigns.
