What influences your designs?What I see on the street. I pick my likes from nature, art and what people find odd and peculiar.  When did you start designing?I have been interested in design for a long time, but I focused on it as a career in 2016. Back then I designed clothes for a dance group I belonged to: Chopperz Crew, for everyday performances and dance competitions.  What challenges are you facing as a designer?Substandard, cheap and counterfeit looks similar to what I’m creating, and also hand-me-down clothes. Which designers do you look up? I am inspired by the late Alexander McQueen’s work. Which is a fashion must-have for both men and women? Definitely the look-alike Avido Bomber Jackets. What are your future goals?To earn a reputation as a talented designer and to be recognised in the field of fashion. Through my work, I wish to make Kibera positively stand out. My first goal however is to complete my education. I recently completed my certificate in fashion and design and have enrolled for a diploma in the same at Buru Buru Institute of Fine Arts. This has really helped me get more insight and knowledge where my work is concerned. Who are some of the high profile individuals you have worked with?I have dressed G Money, Bank Slave, Naiboi, Kelissa, Hon. Kenneth Okoth, Talia Oyando, Don Carlos, Nasty C, Jahmbi Koikai, Chronnix, Cecile, Ty Dolla $ign, Christopher Martin and Octopizzo.  What are you most excited about this year?I’m proud to say that I’ll be showcasing my creations in Australia (Sanaa Fest) and Jamaica (Fashion Block) this year.
