Hi Brenda, My girlfriend and I had been having issues for a while and I asked her for a break so we can sort ourselves out. She agreed. Three months later I tried to call her to tell her that I was now okay, and we could get back together. But she didn’t pick my calls, so I texted and sent her messages on WhatsApp. She has not responded. What do I do? I really love her.  Unfortunately for you, most girls consider 'breaks' to be break-ups. I think your girl moved on as soon as she saw that you were uncertain about her (even though now, apparently, you seem sure – what happened?). The reassurance you needed to stay in the relationship was the assurance she needed to get out. Maybe she didn't take too kindly at being yanked about on a schedule of your own making. Did you consult her on the problems you felt the two of you were facing before you declared it break time? Anyway. If you can, message her, and explain what you are feeling, and be clear that you may have been an idiot, who didn’t want to break up. If she messages back, great. If she doesn't, email. Above and beyond that, I'm sorry my brother. It's done. Ukighostiwa, ghostika. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
