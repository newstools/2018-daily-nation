Opposition leader Raila Odinga Tuesday morning met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and held talks on trade, and the cooperation between the two countries. Mr Odinga, who was received in India officially by Kenya’s High Commissioner to the populous nation Florence Weche, celebrated what he said was a beneficial relationship between India and Kenya. “We spoke on increased Indian investment in Kenya both in industry and particularly in the health sector but also touched on the Maritime agreement, whose aim is to boost transportation, trade and activity in Lake Victoria to see Kenya trade better with its neighbours via the lake,” Mr Odinga said on Twitter, with pictures of him and his wife Ida alongside Mr Modi. The reception of Mr Odinga in New Delhi by Ms Weche was also graced by various Indian government officials. Mr Odinga, who left the country on Friday, also visited Bangalore State to celebrate the legacy of his father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and the Kenya-Indian ties that saw many students earn scholarships to study in the Asian nation. "Kenya and India have benefitted from each other for decades in many sectors and it is our hope that this visit will strengthen development for both our nations," he said. He also met Gamini Perera, a Cabinet minister in Sri Lanka, and Senator Tan Sri Dato, the president of the Upper House of Malaysia.
