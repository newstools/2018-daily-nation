Hi Brenda, My wife keeps posting her photos on Facebook. They are decent and cute, not disrespectful at all. She is very beautiful. However, I am uncomfortable when men post flirtatious comments on her posts. Should I share with her my concerns or am I just being petty?  Kindly examine your insecurities. Where is this coming from? Do you not trust your wife, or do you not trust the men? If you do not trust your wife, you need to have a conversation with her so that you can explore these insecurities as a couple together. Clearly, her photos are not provocative, so why do you still feel bad? Is it something she is doing to make you uncomfortable? What is the solution here â€“ to stop being on Facebook? Should she hide her face when she goes out in public? If it is the men you don't trust, then you can't do anything about that, unless you want to hide her under a bushel. No! You can't control how the world reacts to your wife. I understand your jealousy, but you live and love in a world where she interacts with other people. I'm afraid you're just going to have to learn to deal. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
