Jubilee Nominated MP Maina Kamanda has accused some of the party's legislators from the Central region of not supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta's policies and the war against graft. The MP said the leaders are campaigning for Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid instead of supporting the President's efforts to implement the "Big Four" agenda. Speaking at his Thuita village in Mathioya Constituency, Mr Kamanda said: "Most of the Mt Kenya leaders rode on the President's coattails to secure their positions but they are now behaving as if they have a bigger master than him. They have even publicly opposed his directive on a lifestyle audit. We will not let them disrespect the Head of State.” Referring to Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen's opposition to lifestyle audits, Mr Kamanda said the leaders should stop showing disrespect to the President and support the fight against corruption. He claimed that some of the leaders have been paid to campaign for the 2022 General Election. Mr Kamanda called for a constitutional amendment, saying it is necessary if the 2022 General Election is to be free and fair. “The Constitution should be amended to ensure that the IEBC is in charge of party primaries,” he said. He urged experienced leaders to call for dialogue and guide the MPs a nd senators. "Mt Kenya leaders should meet and advise the youthful legislators to return to normalcy," Mr Kamanda said. He said there has never been a fair general election, adding that the last election was massively rigged, denying the electorate their preferred leaders. "The Constitution should be amended to ensure that Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission is in charge of party primaries," Mr Kamanda said.
