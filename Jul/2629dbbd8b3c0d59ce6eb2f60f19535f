Ten students from Makhokho Secondary School in Kakamega South are among 14 suspects detained by court for four days over alleged arson. The resident magistrate William Lokopoyit allowed the prosecution to detain the suspects for four days and produce them in court on July 19. The students will be remanded at the Kakamega Juvenile Remand while the teacher and three guards will be held at the local police station. The suspects were brought to court shortly after 2 pm looking tired and dishevelled. The court room was packed with parents and relatives of the students who sat quietly as they followed proceedings. After the suspectsâ€™ brief appearance in the court, they were led back to the cells by police officers. They were arrested on Thursday after two dormitories were gutted at the school on Wednesday. Nothing was salvaged from the dormitories which accommodated 159 students. The fire is reported to have started while students were in class for evening studies. Police later found leaflets strewn in the school compound calling for the ejection of the principal.
