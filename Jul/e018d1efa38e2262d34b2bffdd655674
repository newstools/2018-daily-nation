Police confiscated 74 kilogrammes of bhang in Migori County on Friday as they beef up the war on drug trafficking. The haul, estimated to have a street value of Sh740,000, was seized in Kehancha, Kuria West, and is suspected to have been destined for Nairobi. Kuria West OCPD Benson Makumbi said the suspects escaped and a manhunt is on. "Police officers on patrol on the Kehancha-Migori road approached a saloon car whose passengers appeared suspicious. On realizing a police vehicle was behind them, the driver of the vehicle halted and all of them escaped into a nearby bush," Mr Makumbi said. The total worth of bhang consignments impounded in the region in the last two months is about Sh10 million. Recently, a woman was arrested trafficking 20 kilograms of bhang in a matatu heading to Migori from Isebania. One month ago a 17-year-old was also arrested trafficking the drug worth Sh300,000 in maize bags. "This crime is clearly on the rise but the police have also doubled their efforts in reining in the crime and arresting the perpetrators. We will not relent until the menace is stamped out," County Commissioner Joseph Rotich said.
