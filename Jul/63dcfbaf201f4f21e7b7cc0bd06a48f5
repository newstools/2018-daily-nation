Kajiado County government has signed a deal with Kenya Literature Bureau (KLB) that will see the latter publish competency-based curriculum learning materials for Early Childhood Development (ECD) and vocational training colleges in the county. The county Education and Vocational Training executive Mr Seki Lenku said that the initiative will cost the county about Sh15 million in printing and distribution costs to schools in the county. He said that the literature package will include books, learning charts and other teaching materials. MAA CULTURE “We realised that the learners in the county are not well versed with the Maa culture and language. Through this partnership, we now have an opportunity to tap and mould them in their formative years,” said Mr Lenku. Mr Lenku said that ECD teachers will undergo training in August on curriculum implementation. “The new initiative will improve the provision quality education for our young learners; Governor Joseph ole Lenku will flag off the books in the coming weeks,” she said. VERNACULAR LITERATURE On his part, KLB Managing Director Victor Lomaria said that once published, the books will be uniquely patented to the county government complete with the governor’s seal as a value proposition mark that will uniquely identify them as belonging to the county. He said that the MOU will include the printing of vernacular literature for the county schools. “As your partners in the education sector, we are committed to ensuring quality education is realised in schools within Kajiado County,” said Mr Lomaria.
