Mt Kenya teachers forum wants police deployed in boarding secondary schools following assault of two teachers in Nyeri by students. The group's Coordinator Ndung'u Wangenye said government must ensure teachers are safe as cases of student unrest continue to rock different parts of the country. He condemned last week's attack of two Kirimara Boys High School teachers. The school's deputy principal Linus Muna and Mr Emmanuel Korir are hospitalised at Karatina Nursing Home with serious injuries after being beaten by rowdy students. "We condemn the incident and ask the police to apprehend the culprits. After students are through with the teachers, they will turn to the public. PELTED WITH STONES We are also demanding provision of police officers in schools," said Mr Wangenye. The teachers were pelted with stones last week while conducting their normal duties in the school. Property worth more than Sh700,000 was  destroyed during the incident. Mr Wangenye rejected proposal to abolish boarding schools in the country following increased cases of student unrest. “Abolishing boarding schools will deny needy students of an opportunity to learn in good schools. How do you expect a poor bright student from marginalised communities to learn in prestigious schools like Alliance or Starehe Boys Centre without boarding facilities,” Mr Wangenye said on Sunday. PRIVATISE ACCOMMODATION Should boarding schools be abolished, he observed, the government will have to privatise accommodation facilities just as is the case with colleges and universities. “But the government needs to finance such accommodation through a special fund similar to Higher Education Loans Board for university students,” added Mr Wangenye, who is also the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers Laikipia executive secretary.   Kipsang calls for joint efforts to curb raging chaos, says complacency will worsen the situation.
