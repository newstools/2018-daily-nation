The State was scheduled to borrow Sh293.8 billion by June in a revised budget compared to Sh275.9 billion in the printed estimates — about Sh18 billion more than initially programmed, thereby serving as a boon for commercial banks seeking local fixed-income investment opportunities. During this fiscal year, government borrowing in the domestic market is expected to be limited to Sh279.5 billion as part of efforts to push down the level of fiscal deficit to 5.7 per cent. This is among the key conditions agreed on with the International Monetary Fund that has offered Sh150 billion as an insurance facility against foreign exchange shocks.
