The Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers wants the government to speed up the formation of tourism protection service (TPS) to safeguard professionalism among players. Executive officer Sam Ikwaye said the TPS, which is under the Tourism Act, 2012, would redeem the industry. “Bona fide member hotels have signed a code of conduct to protect children against sexual exploitation and labour and we take strict disciplinary measures to those going against the code of ethics,” he said. “But we are unable to control some hotels and villas which have not registered with us.” In February, Tourism secretary Najib Balala received a task force report on the TPS and said the service would address security concerns and guarantee tourists safety. This comes during the time when tourism in the coast region is expected to receive a tourism boom as the high season approaches.

Other than the Protection Service, the Taskforce Report received by Mr Balala has also recommended the establishment of a directorate under the Ministry of Tourism and incorporation of wildlife in the Tourism Ministry to create a new ministry to be known as Tourism and Wildlife.
