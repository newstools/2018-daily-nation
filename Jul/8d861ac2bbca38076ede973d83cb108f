All’s well that ends well. After the tumultuous past few days at the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) that led to the sacking of the national sevens head coach and withdrawal of sponsorship for the team following a row over unpaid bonuses, the dust seems to have settled in the rugby circles. A player mutiny that saw the national sevens team boycott their Brand Kenya-branded kit in the Paris leg of the World Sevens Series, and the subsequent sacking of coach Innocent Simiyu had threatened to put a damper on Kenya’s preparations for this month’s Rugby Sevens World Cup in San Francisco, USA. SH20 MILLION SPONSORSHIP Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa and his tourism colleague, Mr Najib Balala, on Thursday announced that the Sh20 million sponsorship had been reinstated following talks between the government and the KRU that also reinstated coach Simiyu. The good news was followed by Kenya’s 45-36 victory over Zimbabwe on Saturday in the qualifying series for the 15s World Cup, which came just a week after the Simbas had defeated hosts Morocco in another match of these series. It is important for Kenya to qualify and perform well at the World Cup tournaments in both versions of the game, as this will open up further funding and encourage fledgling talent. HURDLES Therefore, the national team players and coaches must be allowed to focus singularly on clearing the high hurdles ahead of them than engaging in boardroom battles with the union over what’s rightfully theirs. There’s no question over the fact that KRU erred in failing to keep its part of the bargain by delaying the players’ allowances. That shouldn’t happen. In fact, the monies should be paid direct to the players’ bank accounts rather than through the union’s coffers, where they risk being diverted to other “projects”.
