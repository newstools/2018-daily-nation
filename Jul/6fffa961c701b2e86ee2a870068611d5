Three interesting sports events in the past three weeks have put Kenya in the limelight. First, our athletes topped the medal standings at the World Under-20 Championships in athletics in Tampere, Finland. The juniors achieved the feat that no other African country has, collecting 11 medals — six gold, four silver and a bronze — in the event held between July 10 and 15. Then three days ago the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) council session in Buenos Aires handed Kenya the rights to host the 2020 World U-20 championships, having successfully hosted the World U-18 event in Nairobi last year. FIVE DISCIPLINES Thirdly, Kenya collected 15 medals (6, 4, 5) at the Africa Youth Games that ended on Saturday in Algiers. It is encouraging that two of the gold medals and one silver came from swimming (Maria Brunlehner) and girls’ javelin (Martha Musai), who claimed a rare victory. However, the medal tally dropped from the 25 (7, 11, 7) won in 2014. One drawback was that Kenya was only represented in five disciplines — athletics, tennis, swimming, beach volleyball and hockey — out of the featured 26. The country should have entered competitors in 18 disciplines but financial constraints saw rugby, tae kwon do, boxing and badminton, among others, being dropped. KILL DREAMS Youth and junior championships form the backbone of sports. It is from them that a country nurtures its future stars. Missing out from the competitions kills dreams. In Algeria, Kenya tested its ammunition ahead of the 2020 World U-20 championships. Kenya should invest in programmes that help to produce stars across all disciplines and field as many athletes as possible in these championships for exposure and experience, considering that the 2020 Tokyo and 2024 Paris Olympic Games are not far away.
