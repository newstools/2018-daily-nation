Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards coaches will be seeking to get the better of each other as Kenya’s most successful clubs clash in the 84th ‘Mashemeji derby’. The match, set for 3pm at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, is the only SportPesa Premier League fixture this weekend with other teams engaged in the domestic cup competition. Gor Mahia, on 49 points, are out to extend their lead at the summit of the table to 12 points, while Ingwe will be aiming to climb further in the standings. Here are the key battle fronts where the match could be won or lost: Shaban Odhoji v Ezekiel Owade ******Gor coach Dylan Kerr is likely to retain Shaban Odhoji in between the sticks after keeping a clean sheet in the midweek 4-0 win over Yanga in a Caf Confederation Cup Group D tie. Though largely untested in the clash, Odhoji has been outstanding whenever called upon and will look to overshadow inexperienced but promising Ezekiel Owade in Leopards goal. Owade has been exceptional lately for Ingwe since crossing over from Nakumatt in January. Harun Shakava v Ezekiel Odera *****It will be a battle of captains between lanky defender Harun Shakava and forward Ezekiel Odera, the latter wearing the armband for suspended Duncan Otieno. Odera, formerly at Gor, has nine league goals and will hope to evade his marker and increase his tally while Shakava, scorer in the last derby on May 1 will be wary of the Leopards dangerman. Abdallah Salim v Jacques Tuyisenge ******How long can no-nonsense Salim bully Rwandese striker Tuyisenge is a question awaiting answers this afternoon. Tuyisenge tops Gor scoring charts with 10 goals and given room, is dangerous both on headers and shots. Edward Seda v Humphrey Mieno *****Ingwe coach Rodolfo Zapata has said that today’s match will be won or lost in midfield. Seda has fitted well back into the side after rejoining the club from Mathare United midseason, but his battle with Mieno is set to prove the toughest this season. Gor Mahia coach Dylan Kerr is likely to partner Mieno and Francis Kahata, meaning Seda and Victor Majid must work tirelessly to make their afternoon a forgettable one. Jaffari Owiti v Godfrey Walusimbi *****Fleet footed Owiti comes up against the experienced legs of Walusimbi, who, on a good day, can maraud the left flank tirelessly. Youthful Owiti, formerly of Chemelil Sugar, on the other hand is a creative force at Ingwe with his dribbling skills and powerful shots troubling opponents.
