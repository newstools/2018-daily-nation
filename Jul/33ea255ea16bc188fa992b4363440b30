Two warders attached to Naivasha GK Prison have been arrested over the kidnapping of a woman who was rescued on Thursday after detectives shot and killed three suspects. Murang’a County Criminal Investigations Officer Julius Rutere said the two are being interrogated to establish whether they were part of the gang that kidnapped Ms Margret Waithira on July 13, dragged her into one of the kidnapper’s home and demanded a ransom of Sh5 million. “We are also investigating the source of the firearms and the source of the GK number plates which were in the kidnappers’ vehicle,” Mr Rutere said. The suspects who were gunned down included an 80-year-old granny who has been identified as Wambui Muturi. The other two suspects have been named as John Mwangi and Samuel Kang’ethe. Ms Waithira was rescued at Gathuku village after a six-day ordeal. The elderly woman is said to have cooked for the gang and had threatened the victim. Ms Waithira said she was driving her car on July 13 when the armed gangsters, using a vehicle with government plates, blocked her and forced her to take a drink that made her unconscious. “I have not seen the light since that day I was abducted,” Ms Waithira said. Ms Waithira said the kidnappers had a photo of her father and told her that it was him who was their target. The kidnappers then asked for her brothers’ phone numbers and threatened to kill her if they did not receive the money in 10 days.   The suspects had kidnapped a woman and demanded Sh5 million ransom.
