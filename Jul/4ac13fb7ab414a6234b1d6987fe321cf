The Kenya Methodist University (KeMU) has asked for more time to implement the recommendations of an inspection report by the Commission for University Education (CUE), saying that the September deadline is too short. KeMU board of trustees chairman Silas Muriuki Rutere has written to CUE requesting for an extension of the six-month deadline that expires on March 30, 2019 to enable the institution to conclude the institutionâ€™s restructuring. In the CUE inspection report dated September last year, KeMU and the Karen-based Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA), were given a year each to restructure their operations and get on a sound financial footing, failure to which their licences would be revoked. In a letter dated July 9 and addressed to CUE Chief Executive Officer Mwenda Ntarangwi, Mr Rutere said the board of trustees had identified non-core properties, which have been earmarked for sale. He said some of the prime properties identified for sale include Kithoka Farm in Meru, KeMU Hub in Nairobi and Nakuru plots.
