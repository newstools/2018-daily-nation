When International Automobile Federation (FIA) approved next year’s Safari Rally as a World Rally Championship Candidate event status last week, it created the path for the return of the iconic event to WRC Series. If successful, FIA, will officially grant Kenya the rights to host the 2020 Safari Rally as a WRC event hence marking the return of the global circuit for the first time since 2002. The move by FIA to give Kenya a chance was not by default. It took concerted ef-forts and campaign by the Kenya Motor Sports Federation (KMSF), which rallied stakeholders and the ministries of Sports and Tourism to support the bid. The intervention by President Uhuru Kenyatta that saw FIA president FIA President Jean Todt visit Kenya twice also boosted the cause. This year’s Safari Rally, held in March with the route being tailored to suit the WRC specifications, also elevated the campaign. However, KMSF must not sit back, rather it must expend energies and resources to ensure everything is in place, including security and effective communication systems. The government will need to do more work. Besides its offer to pay the Sh100 million to FIA and putting up a fully-fledged secretariat at Kasarani, it has to do proper marketing internationally. Sport is now a significant part of the tourism industry in Kenya, with athletes visiting from Europe, Asia, the USA and other parts of the world. This will be an opportune time for Kenya Tourism Board and other government arms to tap and promote the country as a sports tourism destination.
