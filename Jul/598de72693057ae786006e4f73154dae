The Building Bridges Initiative Taskforce will hold consultations with organisations that are planning to hold conferences on war against corruption. In a press release by Joint Secretaries Martin Kimani and Paul Mwangi on Wednesday, the consultations will inform the team's preparations of a citizens' conversation on corruption, which was planned for August 6-8 but has been postponed. "The conference will seek to open space for citizen voices to be heard clearly in this important national moment. The Taskforce is convinced that combating corruption will entail the creation of conditions for individual citizens, groups and communities to set the cultural and social conditions that uphold integrity, honour and our constitutional values," the statement says. The Taskforce concluded its third consultation and deliberation retreat today. MEMORANDA Further, the Secretariat has asked the public to send proposals on the nine-point Joint Communique that aims to foster durable unity. It listed conditions that each proposal should satisfy: clearly outlining the policy, administrative reform proposals and implementation modalities for each identified challenge area. Mobile phone and emails details must be included in the submissions that should be emailed to bbi@citizensupport.go.ke. "The aim of the submissions will be best considered if they seek to provide solutions on how Kenyans and Kenya can build lasting unity by tackling the challenges articulated in the Joint Communique," the statement adds. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga formed the Taskforce after their March 9 meeting to end hostilities fanned by the controversial elections last year. The two leaders want to tackle ethnic antagonism and competition, lack of national ethos, inclusivity, devolution, safety and security and corruption.
