Mau Mau veterans and Ol Kalou town traders on Friday stopped a contractor from cutting down a tree in Ol Kalou town to pave way for a county beautification project. Singing Mau Mau war songs, the veterans surrounded the tree shielding it from a contractor hired to cut it down. The veterans said the indigenous tree was planted by the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta in 1952 and is a historical site as well as a symbol of Ol Kalou town. The veterans then conducted Kikuyu rituals to ‘curse’ anyone who dares cut down Mununga tree (Ekebergia capensis), also known as Cape Ash, that was planted by the late Kenyatta before his arrest and detention by the colonial authorities.   After his detention, Mr Njoroge said, Mzee Kenyatta visited Ol Kalou in 1963 and addressed the public from the venue and made it a habit to address the locals from that same spot every time he was in town. “There can never be Ol Kalou town without this tree. This tree is the origin of Ol Kalou town. We have trees growing in Nairobi city centre, why do we want to destroy our history? We won't allow that to happen,” said Mr Francis Kamau, another Mau Mau veteran. MAATHAI TREE The residents are also opposed to cutting down of another tree, Pando tree, planted in honour of environmentalist Wangari Mathai after her death. A trader, Mr David Wanjohi, said he bought the tree at Sh1,000 and planted in the area in honour of the late Mathai. The local ward representative Ken Mukira supported the residents, saying the tree should be preserved. “I have raised the issue with the executive and we agreed the tree must be preserved,” said Mr Mukira. Bu the contractor Hannah Nyambura insisted the tree must be removed. “I have a plan to follow, they can go plant trees in their farms. I am under instructions to remove all trees in the town to pave way for paving blocks,” said Ms Nyambura.
