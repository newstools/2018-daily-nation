Three ward representatives were on Thursday arrested for questioning over chaos that rocked Wajir County Assembly on Tuesday and Wednesday. The arrested ward representatives are: Mr Shalle Bule (Hadado ward), Mr Abdi Ahmed (Wagalla Ganyure ward) and Mr Osman Muktar (Arbajahan Griftu ward). Stand-off between the MCAs and Speaker Ibrahim Yakub was sparked off when the latter failed to announce Mr Abdi Ahmed as the Minority Party’s representative at the Wajir County Assembly Service Board. On several occasions, ward representatives have clashed, sometimes engaging in fist fights, over appointments to the county service board. During the recent three-day chaos, three armed bodyguards attached to Mr Yakub stormed the assembly and allegedly threatened a ward rep. Following the arrest, MCAs numbering about 15, stormed the Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices where their colleagues were taken to, accusing detectives of bias. Addressing journalists, Ibrahim Ure ward representative Mahat Rashid accused the officers of harassing and intimidating county assembly members. Mr Rashid said that they have made progress following a night meeting in which he claims they Mr Abdi will be name minority party’s representative at 2:30pm on Friday. Mr Shekhey Ahmed, Elben MCA, accused police officers of bias and warned they may consider impeaching the Speaker should the wrangles continue.
