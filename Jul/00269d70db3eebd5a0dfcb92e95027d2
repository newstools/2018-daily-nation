The government has slashed by half fees for students in technical institutions and allocated Sh30,000 bursary for every student who will join the institutions from September in a bid to lure more youth to take up technical courses. Deputy President William Ruto said the capitation, together with access to funding from the Higher Education Loans Board (Helb) is meant to ensure that those seeking to take such courses can do so even without money. Speaking Sunday at St Thomas Moore Kairuri Catholic Parish in Embu County, Mr Ruto said the national government is building and equipping technical institutions in every constituency to boost access to learning. BIG FOUR AGENDA The DP said the government has identified technical courses such as automotive engineering, plant engineering, masonry, plumbing and other crafts as key drivers of the ambitious Big Four agenda. “We have reduced fees by 50 per cent and it is now possible for a student to go to technical vocational education and training institutions and train even without fees. “We have the bursary fund and loans for youths in universities under Helb will be extended to TIVET institutions. We cannot talk about value addition without skilled labour,” said Mr Ruto. He said the government has built and equipped technical institutions in Runyenjes, Manyatta and Mbeere South constituencies and is constructing one at Kanyuambora in Mbeere North. Mr Ruto also announced that the government will supply 20 milk coolers to farmers in Embu to help promote dairy farming and value addition ventures.
