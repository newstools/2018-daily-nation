Former Nyandarua governor Daniel Waithaka and former county officials Grace Gitonga and Kihiu Gichinga who are facing corruption-related charges have been released on Sh10 million bond each with surety. The three are facing charges over a fraudulent Sh50 million water and sewerage tender. Nakuru Chief Magistrate Josephat Kalo said the prosecution did not provide enough evidence to show how freeing the three on bond would affect the case. Earlier Friday, the three had been arraigned in a court in Nyandarua but they did not take plea as the court referred their files to Nakuru, citing lack of jurisdiction. While releasing them on bond, Mr Kalo declined to give the accused the option of paying cash bail. At the same time, the magistrate issued warrants of arrest against five other suspects in the same case. The case has been referred back to the Nyahururu court.   EACC hunts for 2 other suspects.
