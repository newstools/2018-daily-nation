Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya was on Monday acquitted of assault charges by a Butere court. Mr Oparanya was accused of assaulting and causing serious bodily harm to Mr John Waka on August 17, 2008, when he was Butere MP, contrary to section 251 of the Penal Code CAP 63 of the laws of Kenya. Butere Senior Resident Magistrate Felix Makoyo dismissed the assault charges against the governor citing lack of evidence. “The court found that the complainant was not a reliable witness as he gave conflicting testimony. The court therefore found that the accused had no case to answer,” the magistrate ruled. On Monday, the governor sat calmly in the dock as Mr Makoyo read the judgement that took less than 30 minutes. According to court records, Mr Oparanya was accused of attacking the complainant when he went to ask for Sh16,600 payment for trees he had planted in the accused's compound. A clinical officer who issued a P3 form to the complainant and the doctor who examined him told the court that Mr Waka did not suffer the alleged injuries. Speaking after his acquittal, Mr Oparanya said the case was politically instigated to frustrate his career. “From the beginning I knew there was no case but political witch-hunt. I am glad that it has finally come to an end,” said the governor. The governor was represented by lawyer Dr Ken Nyaundi and the county attorney Moses Sande throughout the ten-year period of the case.
