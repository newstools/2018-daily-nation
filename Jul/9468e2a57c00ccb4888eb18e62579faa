The country is in celebratory mood again after the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Council caucus on Thursday in Buenos Aires, Argentina, awarded Nairobi the rights to host the 2020 World Athletics Under-20 Championships. What largely contributed to the successful bid was the country’s achievement in hosting the World Under-18 Championships last year that recorded a huge turnout. Indeed, the success of that championships has been the talk around the world, what with the fine organisation displayed at the game’s village at Kenyatta University. The country also earned accolades considering the just-ended World Under-20 Championships in Tampere, Finland, attracted fewer crowds even as Kenya topped the medal standing for the fourth time in the history of the event. Winning the bid might have been easy but the difficult part starts now. Early preparations will be key to success. WARD OFF CARTELS Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa has estimated the championships will cost Sh2 billion and will require proper planning, structures and systems to get it right again. The team leader, who will be appointed to spearhead the preparations, should be a person of integrity, ready to make firm and judicious decisions besides warding off cartels that always swirl around where there is big cash. Relevant ministries must pull together and avoid last minute rush and decisions that almost saw the IAAF move the Under-18 Championships to another venue. Sports ministry officials must set up systems and start fundraising if we are replicate the success.
