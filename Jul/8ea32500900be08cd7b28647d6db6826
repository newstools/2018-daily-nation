Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has announced an investigation on ministry officials who allegedly received Sh35m to pay Solai dam victims. Dr Matiang'i said he will submit the probe report to the Senate committee that is probing the Solai dam tragedy in 30 days. This came after Mr Perry Mansukh, the owner of the dam that burst killing 48 people and rendering hundreds homeless, told the Senate team that he gave Sh35 million to provincial administration officers to give out to the victims of the tragedy. The dam owner said he gave out the money as compensation to indemnify himself from the damages caused. Mr Matiang'i said those found culpable for professional misconduct will be dealt with according to the law.
