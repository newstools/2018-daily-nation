Hi Brenda, I have a problem. My boyfriend can’t pronounce my name. He would like to meet my friends and I am embarrassed to take him to them because I know I will also laugh when he mispronounces my name. Please help.  This is such a nice problem to have. Listen, do what cheaters do – he doesn't have to call you by name. This is your chance to do two things. One, send him an audio of you pronouncing your name, and tell him you're perfectly willing to introduce him to your friends after he learns how to get it right (but surely, how hard is your name?). Two, here's your chance to think of a plethora of names that he can call you -- baby, honey, sweetie pie, the only female in his email. And so on. (Also, these are fixable problems, you lucky girl! Go forth and prosper). *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? E-mail: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   Kindly redirect your emotions as they are falling onto barren land.
