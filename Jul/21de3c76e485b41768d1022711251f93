The 12th edition of the Prinsloo Sevens, the first leg of the Stanbic Bank national sevens circuit, kicks off at Nakuru Athletics Club today with 40 clubs on parade. Defending champions Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) are in Pool D together with last year’s losing finalist Top Fry Nakuru, Nondies and Nzoia Sugar Webuye in their quest to retain the title. Kabras Sugar are in Pool A alongside Strathmore Leos, Stanbic Mwamba and Mean Machine. Resolution Impala are in Pool C that also features Menengai Oilers, Catholic Monks and Regional Logistic Mombasa who are making their maiden appearance in the tournament. Menengai Cream Homeboyz will be seeking to win their second title on the same grounds they clinched the Great Rift 10-a-side in April. They are in Pool B with Kenya Harlequins, Blakblad and Silverstone Kisumu. Hosts Nakuru will receive Sh1million to help them in organising the the competition. Speaking during the handing over of the cheque to Nakuru RFC officials, Stanbic Manager in charge of Communication and Events Willis Angira said that the bank was keen on sponsoring the circuit as rugby had proved to be a good ambassador for Kenya across the world. “We started with the sponsorship of Mwamba RFC and we have now stepped up the deal to the national sevens circuit and we hope to be involved even more events,” said Angira. The schools’ and women categories began Friday.
