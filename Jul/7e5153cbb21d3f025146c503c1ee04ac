They vowed to destroy defending champion Selemon Barega from Ethiopia and Kenya’s magnificent duo delivered the promise in style and gusto. Kenya’s Edward Zakayo and Stanley Waithaka ended Ethiopia’s dominance when they delivered a 1-2 feat in men’s 5,000m at the ongoing World Under-20 Championships in Tampere, Finland on Saturday. It was a glorious and sweet revenge for Zakayo and Waithaka, who were left playing second fiddle, settling for silver and bronze at the World Under-18 Championships last year in Nairobi where Barega triumphed. Zakayo claimed victory in 13 minutes and 20.16 seconds as Waithaka settled second for silver in 13:20.57 to hand back Kenya the title David Bett last won for the country in 2010. Norwegian Ingebrigtsen Jakob locked out Barega from a podium finish, clocking a new European Under-20 record time of 13:20.78 for bronze. The crest-fallen Barega, who was the winner in 2016 Bydgoszcz, Poland, was forced to settle fourth in 13:21.16. David Bett is the last Kenya to win men’s 5,000m title from the 2010 Championships where Kenyan men swept all the middle and long distances titles for the overall crown. “I really want to thank Waithaka because he is the one who dismantled the Ethiopians in the race. Our plan went well because I knew Barega was favourite and had a good finishing kick,” said Zakayo. Zakayo dedicated his victory to his mother Agnes Pingwa, who hails from Loita village, Narok South in Narok County and his coach, Erick Kimaiyo. Waithaka was over the moon, saying their hard work in training had paid dividends. “We promised to destroy Barega after planning well for the race and we did exactly that. We planned I go first before Zakayo would finish the race because of his superior kick. That is what team work can deliver,” said Waithaka. Waithaka said Barega took the advantage of their inexperience last year in Nairobi but this time round he was shocked. “We have had not only trained hard especially in the last lap but also reviewed Barega’s videos to see where we could nail him. Its suich a good feeling and we thank God for the medals,” said Waithaka. Kenya now has seven medals: five gold, one silver and one bronze going into the final day on Sunday. Gold medallist are George Manangoi (1,500m), Beatrice Chebet (5,000m), Rhonex Kipruto (10,000m), Cellphine Chespol (3,000m steeplechase) and Edward Zakayo 5,000m. Silver medal- Stanley Waithaka (5,000m) and bronze medal-Justus Soget (1,500m). Sports and Heritage Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa and his Principal Secretary Kirimi Kaberia were at hand to receive the two athletes after their good performance. Earlier in the 800m race, Solomon Lekuta and Ngeno Kipngetich led in their respective heats and qualified for the finals set for Sunday. Lekuta led in the first heat, clocking 1:47.56 ahead of Ethiopia’s Adisu Giram who timed 1:47.88. In the second heat, Ngeno lead after clocking 1:46.81 ahead of Belgium’s Eliot Crestan who finished in 1:46.84. The last day of the championships will also feature World Under-18 2,000m steeplechase champion Leonard Bett who is the favourite for the gold medal. He will be facing a competitive field which includes Uganda's Albert Chemutai who has a personal best of 8:17.17. 2016 Africa Cross Country champion Miriam Cherop and World Under-18 bronze medallist Edna Jebitok will be battling it out in the 1,500m race. In the 10,000m race walk, World Under-18 bronze medallist Samson Ndigiti recorded his season's best after finishing a distant seventh in 41:30.52. Ndigiti took the early lead with 17 laps to go but the pace changed in the last 12 laps to go with China’s Yao Zhang taking the lead before cutting the tape in a personal best of 40 minutes, 32.06. In the women’s triple jump, Gloria Mulei's dream of returning home with gold ended painfully after she finished 11th in her heat with a jump of 12:29m.   It was Kenya’s fourth gold medal at the championships.
