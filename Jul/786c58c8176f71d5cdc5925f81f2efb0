Teachers in lower cadres will from next week get their full pay increase while those in special schools will have their allowances collapsed and consolidated with their salaries. The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) indicated that it would stop paying the Sh10,000 special school allowance from July 1, 2018 in a circular dated July 16. The circular was addressed to country directors, education officials and heads of institutions on the implementation of the second phase of the Sh54 billion collective bargaining agreement (CBA) 2017-2021. About 160,000 teachers in lower cadres are set to benefit from the full pay, while 3,000 teachers in special schools will have their allowances consolidated with their salaries. However other allowances such as house, hardship, commuter, annual leave and disability guide allowance of Sh15,000 per month will continue to be paid to teachers. INCREMENTAL DATES “Payment of applicable allowances to institutional administrators who have been upgraded will be gradual within the implementation period,” said TSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia. She added that the circular applies to all teachers in service as at July 1 2018. “Teachers converting into the new salary scales will retain their incremental dates. Annual salary increment for all teachers will continue to apply as provided for in the code of regulations for teachers (2015).” She said the second phase, set to benefit 312,060 teachers at a cost of Sh18billion, would be concluded on June 30, 2019 while the remaining teachers will have their salaries deal implemented by 2021. The first phase, whose implementation started July last year, cost Sh13.7billion. The circular on the second phase of the implementation is copied to Cabinet secretaries Amina Mohamed (Education), Henry Rotich (National Treasury), Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, among others. The increase is being effected in this month’s salary. FOUR PHASES In the increase, Chief Principal in Job Group R (D5), currently earning Sh148,360, will now take home Sh152,937, while the lowest paid Chief Principal in Job Group Q, will earn Sh111,201, up from Sh102,807. The lowest paid teacher (primary teacher II) currently taking home between Sh19,224 and Sh24,250 will now take home between Sh21,756 and Sh27,195. The implementation in two phases is for teachers in job groups H and J while teachers in the upper cadre, who are mostly in administrative positions, will have the increase implemented in four phases. On house allowance, teachers in Nairobi will get between Sh6750 and Sh50,000, those in Mombasa, Kisumu, Malindi,Kilifi, Lamu, Kwale and Naivasha will get between Sh4,500 and Sh35,000. Those in Nyeri, Eldoret, Kericho, Kakamega, Kisii, Embu, Nanyuki, Nakuru, Lodwar and Garissa will get between Sh3,850 and Sh25,000 while teachers in other county headquarters and all other areas will get between Sh3,200 and Sh20,000. PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL Hardship allowances will be between Sh6,600 and Sh38,100, commuter allowance will be between Sh4,000 and Sh16,000 while annual leave allowance will be between Sh4,000 and Sh10,000. Under the CBA, Senior Master (III) falls under T Scale 9, Senior Master (II) under T Scale 10, while Senior Master (I) is T Scale 11. For deputy school heads, the Deputy Principal (IV) falls under T Scale 10, Deputy Principal (III) under T Scale (11), and Deputy Principal (II) in T Scale 12 as Deputy Principal (I) falls under T Scale 13. The new TSC grading structure ranges from (B5 to D5), that is T Scale 5 to 15. The CBA also provides for performance appraisal of teachers by their employer, which Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) is now opposing. TSC and unions had agreed that there would be  annual performance evaluations for all teachers in its employment. IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY Knut has threatened to mobilise teachers across the country for a strike starting September 1, if TSC does not withdraw the contentious Teacher Performance Appraisal and Development (TPAD) tool. Secretary-General Wilson Sossion said the use of TPAD had a  negative impact on teaching in schools. “Teachers are spending a lot of time away from their stations as they have to visit cyber cafés to download, fill and submit forms to the employer instead of imparting knowledge on learners,” he said. However, Mrs Macharia said the rating has improved accountability.   The government has set aside Sh5 billion for recruitment of additional teachers.
