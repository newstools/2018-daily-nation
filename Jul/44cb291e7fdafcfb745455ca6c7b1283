Coast MPs supporting Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid met on Thursday night to discuss Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi’s planned tour of the region Saturday. The mainly opposition MPs who have declared their support for MP Ruto met at the English Point Marina to pre-empt Mr Mudavadi’s overtures to get a slice of the 1.7 million coast votes. The ANC leader is expected in Kwale Saturday to attend a victory party for Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza, during which he will hold talks with local leaders to win their support ahead of the 2022 ballot. ROUSING WELCOME Kwale ANC women leader Merlin Mwahari Friday said all was set for residents to give Mr Mudavadi a rousing welcome. Mr Ruto has been at the coast eight times since the March political ceasefire be-tween President Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga which softened local leaders’ hard-line stance against Jubilee Party. Kanu leader Gideon Moi has also been in the region and pledged to work with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho ahead of next elections. Ford-K leader Moses Wetang’ula has also been in the region on the same mission. HANDSHAKE The handshake between President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga, which ended tensions following last year’s disputed elections, has thrown opposition unity at the coast into disarray. On Thursday, at least 15 MPs backing the DP drew a list of areas they wanted the DP to tour to initiate development projects and reach out to locals for support. A number of MPs who attended the four-hour closed-door meeting agreed to conduct “development conscious” meetings that would allow them sell the DP’s agenda.Among those who attended the meeting were MPs Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Paul Katana (Kaloleni), Getrude Mbeyu (Woman Rep, Kilifi), Ali Wario (Bura), and Ali Mbogo (Kisauni). Other MPs at the meeting were Badi Twalib (Jomvu), Benjamin Tayari (Kinango), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), Tandaza (Matuga), Owen Baya (Kilifi North) and Sheriff Ali (Lamu East).
