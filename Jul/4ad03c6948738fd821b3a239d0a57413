The cost of petrol has gone up while diesel and kerosene will cost less in the latest fuel price review released by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). In Nairobi, one litre of super petrol will retail at Sh112.20, a Sh3.39 increase, while diesel will retail at Sh103.25, a decrease of Sh0.35. The new prices take effect on July 15, 2018 and will be in force until August 14, 2018 when the ERC will make the next review. In a statement released Saturday, ERC said the new fuel prices are as a result of change in the cost of imported petroleum products. At the same time, ERC says that prices have also been affected by the depreciation of the Kenyan shilling’s exchange rate to the US dollar. “The changes in this month's prices have been as a consequence of the average landed cost of imported Super Petrol increasing by 5.54 per cent from USD 700.01 per ton in May 2018 to USD 738.77 per ton in June 2018,” ERC said in a statement. In Eldoret, petrol will now retail at Sh114.05 and diesel at Sh105.32 while in Kisumu petrol will sell at Sh114.12 per litre and diesel at Sh105.39. In Mombasa the price of petrol will be Sh108.90 while that of diesel will be Sh99.96. At the same time, motorists in Nakuru will buy a litre of petrol for Sh112.87 while that of diesel will go for Sh104.14.
