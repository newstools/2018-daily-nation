The Nairobi County is set to construct three rehabilitation centres to reduce the rate of alcoholism. Alcoholic Drinks Control and Licensing chairman Kennedy Odhiambo said the board will open the rehabilitation centres in Riruta, Mathare and Jericho, as it intensifies efforts to reform the youth. "Already the procurement process has begun and it is only a matter of time before the tender is awarded in readiness for the start of the construction," Mr Odhiambo said during a sensitisation workshop at Maisha Poa Centre in Dagoretti South on Friday. The Governor Mike Sonko led-administration on Tuesday raised concerns over the ease with which teenagers are accessing alcohol. HUMAN HEALTH Nairobi Deputy County Commissioner Stephen Kihara called for a multisectoral approach to curb the alcohol and drug menace in the city. Mr Kihara said interrelated strategies are required to adequately fight the menace. "The abuse of drugs can have serious ramifications on a personâ€™s physical health, mental health, and overall wellbeing," Mr Kihara said. Dagoretti OCPD George Seda vowed to wipe out the crime in Dagoretti North and Dagoretti South, urging residents to volunteer information on drug hot spots and peddlers. "Everybody needs to be involved in the first against drugs, crime and alcohol; but I am urging the board to close bars operating near schools and residential areas," he said.
