A Form One student from Ngara Girls High School in Nairobi who went missing last month has been found in Mombasa. According to police reports, Saadia Adan was wearing a night dress when she was found in Bondeni by a Good Samaritan. Mombasa Police Commander Johnston Ipara said the girl said she escaped from the school at night. “Upon further interrogations, she revealed to us that she ran away from the school because she does not want to be in a boarding school but we are continuing with our probe to get more details on this,” said Mr Ipara. Police said the girl said she took a bus to Mombasa where a relative lives. INVESTIGATIONS Mombasa Urban OCPD Eliud Monari said the girl has been taken to hospital for check-up as investigations continue. Security sources confided to Nation that the girl was taken from the hands of the Good Samaritan by a General Service Unit (GSU) officer, her brother’s colleague. “His brother is a GSU officer. He is the one who sent his fellow officer to go rescue his sister. It is the girl who revealed that her brother is an officer,” said the source. MID-TERM BREAK According to the family, Saadia, who had gone home for the midterm break on June 15, was escorted to school by her elder sister Halima Adan on June 25 at around 2pm. She was dropped inside the school by the sister who then left as she was being checked in together with other students. However, on Wednesday evening, the family was informed that Saadia had gone missing from the school compound. The school's management said Saadia was last seen on June 27 at around 5.30pm, a claim the family has disputed.   School informed family their daughter went missing a day after returning from midterm break.
