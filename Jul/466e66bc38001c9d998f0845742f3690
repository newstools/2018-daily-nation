Two occurrences that have caused a lot of pain and suffering could easily have been prevented. One is the ongoing demolition of houses in Nairobi’s Kibra constituency to pave the way for road construction. The other is the eviction of squatters from Mau Forest to save this critical water catchment area. There are poignant lessons from both — not just for the victims but, more so, for the authorities for apparently sleeping on the job. The people, who now find themselves homeless, would probably never have been in this situation had the local officials done their work properly. EASE TRAFFIC In the case of Kibra, the road project did not just come out of the blue. Those who built houses on the road reserve may not have been aware, but this project is a part of an elaborate plan for the development of the area. Whoever allowed the construction on this land of five resource centres, four schools, two hospitals and makeshift homes for nearly 2,000 households is clearly to blame for the mess. These just had to give way for the expansion of the Ngong-Lang'ata link road to open up the area and ease traffic to and from Nairobi’s city centre. But the victims are not blameless either. They had been given ample notice to vacate or be forced out but, perhaps, hoped nothing would happen. DEMOLITIONS This explains the generally peaceful situation amid the demolitions. It’s a bitter price to pay for impunity. In Mau Summit, the water tower was not invaded overnight. Everybody saw the villagers move in and put up their dwellings. Indeed, they were also encouraged by some politicians to stay put. It’s painful to have to evict people from their homes;  but the potential wider benefit supersedes individual gain. However, it is important that all strictly follow the rules and regulations in the public interest — in this case, the vital water catchment area.
