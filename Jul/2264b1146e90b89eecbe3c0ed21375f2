Four people have died and other injured in a road crash in Kambiti, Murang'a County. Muranga South base commander Abdullahi Dato on Thursday said a rescue operation is underway. "The weight of the truck contributed to the huge impact that led to a fatal accident given that it was in steep slope," Mr Dato said. The injured are admitted at Thika Level Five Hospital and Makuyu health centre.   The 5pm incident involved a truck and a 14-seater matatu on the Nairobi/Nyeri highway. Mr Dado urged motorists to drive carefully.
