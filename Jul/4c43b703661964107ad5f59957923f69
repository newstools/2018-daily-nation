RESERVOIR“We will repossess all grabbed public land in the city and ensure all county projects that had stalled due to land grabbing are completed,” said Sonko on Saturday when he supervised the demolition of a wall that had encroached on a road reserve along Access Road in South C estate.He said that the South C water reservoir, which is capable of holding 5 million cubic meters of water, is not operational because private developers have interfered with water pipes that feed the reservoir.Roads executive Muhamed Dagane said the rehabilitation of the 1.1km Access road had stalled for the last three years due to encroachment of a road reserve by a private developer.
