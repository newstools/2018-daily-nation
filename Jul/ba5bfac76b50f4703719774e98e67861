Hi, Iâ€™m dating a lady in her mid-20s. I like her but I have a problem with her not compromising. When we argue, even when she is obviously on the wrong, she sulks until I break the silence. How do I deal with this immaturity? Should I just drop her and deal with a more mature woman?  Hi, I guess it depends on how much you like this lady. I am sure there are some things that you do that she thinks are immature as well, no? Here's a thought. The next time she sulks, leave the house to go to the cyber (or sit on the stoop outside your house, whichever one is more your style) and compose an email to her explaining in logical terms what your issue is and why you feel compromise is important. Instead of saying 'you're always sulking', use language that isn't full of blame like 'when you refuse to talk to me, I feel hurt.' Then, for your next argument, if she sulks again, you must just also start treating her like a baby. You know how sometimes babies get shocked when you imitate their behaviour? Try that. If she is pouting, pout right back at her in her line of vision. Crossing her arms and glaring? Do an exaggerated version of the same. With any luck, she will grow as babies do and learn to use her words.   Kindly redirect your emotions as they are falling onto barren land.
