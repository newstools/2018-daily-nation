Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has said his focus is to win the presidency in 2022. Speaking at the Pentecostal Assemblies of God (PAG) church Saturday when he toured Kwale County, Mr Mudavadi said that ANC is consolidating its grassroots support as it focuses on the 2022 presidential race. "It's no longer a story. I will be there and you (should) just support me. The ideology that ANC is a party associated with Western should not be there. It is a capable national party and everyone of us should know what we expect in 2022," he said. Mr Mudavadi was accompanied by Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza, ANC Secretary-General Barrack Muluka and other ANC MPs.

The biggest opportunity for us is to join with other communities and push our agenda," he said. Mr Tandaza said that being elected on an ANC ticket was a clear sign that the party is not tribal and that it has the support of all Kenyans. "Our road to 2022 is clear – it is Mr Mudavadi who has what it takes to lead this country and we must start now,” Mr Tandaza said. Other leaders who joined Mr Mudavadi during his tour included Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo, Lamu Woman Rep Ruweida Obbo, Kwale Senator Juma Boy, Lamu East MP Shariff Alwy and Kaloleni MP Paul Katana.
