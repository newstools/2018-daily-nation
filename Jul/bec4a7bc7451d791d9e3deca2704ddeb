Many Kenyans who have travelled on the ‘Madaraka Express’ train on the standard gauge railway between Nairobi and Mombasa come back saying they will do it again and again. After all, it takes just about four hours to cover the 400 kilometres in comfort instead of the whole day by bus. With the growing popularity of the fast train service, bus operators have seen their business shrink. And if the efficiency and high standard of service are maintained, the SGR will attract more patrons. However, there have been complaints about the conduct of some Chinese managers of the passenger service and other staff. DISCRIMINATION To put it more bluntly, there are claims by some Kenyans that they have been discriminated against on the trains.This is a serious matter. Even as we welcome foreigners to work in our country and help to develop it, they must never trample on our hospitality. The Chinese have done a pretty good job but that cannot be a justification for haughty behaviour towards Kenyans. After all, this is our country and, if our dignity is violated by foreign benefactors, then even the assistance they may be giving us takes on a hideous hue. OVERRACTIONThat some Kenyans are already calling for a boycott of the train service over claims of bias could be an overreaction but it’s a source of concern. It’s quite unfortunate, considering the fact that this is a long-term investment and the SGR will still have a few Chinese workers when Kenyans fully take over its management in 2027.Many will be eagerly waiting for a report Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia has promised to present to Parliament on Tuesday on the allegations of rampant racism and discrimination of Kenyans working in the SGR. The sooner this matter can be put to rest, the better.
