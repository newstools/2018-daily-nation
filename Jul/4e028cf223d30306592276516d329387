Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has criticised Chief Justice (CJ) David Maraga for faulting Parliament and Treasury for reduction of the Judiciary budget. Mr Kuria said although the National Assembly’s Budget Committee will address the complaint, the Chief Justice should caution judges and magistrates against issuing orders affecting revenue collection. “Justice Maraga is reaping what he sowed in the Judiciary. There are three cases where courts have suspended the implementation of excise duty introduced in Finance Bill, 2018 and collection of tax. You cannot stop collection of tax and complain [over] lack of money," said Mr Kuria. The MP, who is a member of the Budget Committee, said the lawmakers are willing to relook the issue after receiving recommendations from the Executive. Mr Kuria was speaking at Bishop Gatimu Ngandu Girls High School in Mathira, Nyeri County, during a fundraiser on Saturday. He cited the Excisable Goods Management System that the courts stopped Kenya Revenue Authority from effecting following a petition. The CJ said the Judiciary had sought a budget of Sh31.2 billion but the Treasury’s Budgetary Policy Statement capped it at Sh17.3 billion, with a paltry Sh50 million for development. Mr Maraga has warned that following the budget cut, several programmes will be stopped and others scaled down. “In short, we wish to inform the public that while we shall continue doing our best to deliver justice to Kenyans, judicial services will this year be severely affected as a result of the budget cuts. Please bear with us,” he said. The budget cuts, the CJ said, will lead to the stalling of 70 projects, halt of plans to hire 9 Court of Appeal judges, plans to clear all cases above five years old by December 2018 will be a “mirage”, and will “immensely affect the discharge of justice.”   CJ says Judiciary at the mercy of people who won’t even take his calls.
