A female university student on Friday pleaded guilty to stealing money from her mother to spend with her boyfriend. Ms Cynthia Cherop, a Moi University student, was charged with stealing Sh70,000 from her mother’s accounts at Barclays and National Bank, money which she spent with her boyfriend, Mr Josephat Ng'ang'a. She pleaded guilty to the charge. The student, in defence, told the court that she bought second-hand clothes for her business. CCTV footage from Barclays Bank showed Mr Ng’ang’a and Ms Cherop withdrawing the money. Mr Ng'ang'a was also charged with creating disturbance by threatening to beat up Ms Cherop’s mother, Ms Milka Chebosisi Sitati, on June 5 this year. He denied the charge and was released on a cash bail of Sh30,000. Ms Cherop’s mother pleaded with the court to jail her daughter after she pleaded guilty. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi said it was unfortunate that she stole the money to spend with her boyfriend whom her mother did not approve of. However, two of Ms Cherop’s uncles pleaded with the court to release her, saying they wanted her to continue with her college studies. Stunned, the magistrate asked Ms Cherop: “What have you done to your mother for her to hate you this much?” Ms Cherop said it was her first criminal offence. State prosecutor Solomon Naulikha asked the court to treat the accused as a first offender and did not oppose her being ordered to serve probation. Mr Cherop has been remanded until August 2 awaiting a probation report.
