Machakos County Commissioner Matilda Sakwa has been appointed acting National Youth Service director-general to replace Richard Ndubai who is facing graft-related charges. Ms Sakwa's appointment by President Uhuru Kenyatta will be critical in bringing sanity to the institution which has been plagued by mega corruption scandals for years, leading to several calls for its disbandment. The administrator, who is pursuing a PhD, holds a Masterâ€™s degree in development studies from the International Institute of Social Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands. She also has a postgraduate diploma in HIV/Aids from East Anglia University, UK and another diploma in government reforms from Beijing, China in addition to a certificate on strategic leadership from the Kenya School of Government. Ms Sakwa has previously served as a district officer in Kangundo and in other areas before she was appointed the Machakos county commissioner. She recently led a team of security officers in Machakos to impound a consignment of contraband sugar which was kept at a flower firm in Athi River. Ms Sakwa will report to her new work station on Wednesday.   Only 8, including PS Omollo, are out.
