The High Court in Nakuru has ruled that the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) is the one legally mandated to pick students for its 42 campuses across the country. KMTC and the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS) have for three years been fighting over the legal mandate to select students for admission into the medical college. Justice Anthony Ndung’u in his judgement on Tuesday ruled that the law provides that KMTC should be the body responsible for placing medical students in its campuses. ADMIT STUDENTS The court further ordered that the more than 2,000 students who had been selected by the two government bodies in 2015 and 2016 be admitted into the college. “The academic board established under Section 11 of the KMTC Act is declared the body mandated to admit students to KMTC under Section 6 of the KMTC Act,” the judge ruled. The ruling is now expected to settle the legal standoff between the two institutions which have been claiming authority to place medical students. The case was filed in 2016 by Mr Kyalo Kamina, one of the students who had been selected and who petitioned the court seeking a legal interpretation on who between KMTC and KUCCPS is responsible for the selection of students for admission into the college. COMPLAINTS This followed countrywide complaints that students who were selected by KUCCPS were being turned away by the medical college which was only admitting those it had selected. This led to a court order temporarily barring the admission of students pending the hearing and determination of the matter. The students who were set to join the college were left stranded after they were caught up in the middle of the supremacy battle between the two institutions. The conflict saw Parliament approve amendments to a universities law giving KMTC powers to select and admit its students.
