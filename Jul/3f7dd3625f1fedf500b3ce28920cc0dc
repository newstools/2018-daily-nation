A retired bishop, Johannes Otieno Angela, has been charged in Bondo with defiling a 14-year-old girl. The former Anglican Church of Kenya bishop appeared before Bondo Principal Magistrate Moses Obiero who released him on a Sh100,000 cash bail or Sh200,000 bond after he denied the charge on Monday. The case will be mentioned on July 16 and will be heard in two consecutive days from July 30 this year. Police in Bondo arrested the 66-year-old retired bishop on Friday at his home after the Standard Eight pupil reported him at a local childrenâ€™s home. The minor is said to have been staying with him.
