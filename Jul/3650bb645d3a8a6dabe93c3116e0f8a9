There is some really good news for homeowners and the many others aspiring to free themselves from the clutches of greedy landlords and join the club. President Uhuru Kenyatta has assented to a Bill allowing a 15 per cent tax relief for Kenyans wishing to buy houses under what is aptly dubbed the Affordable Housing Scheme. Incidentally, this marks the beginning of the government’s ambitious plan to build 500,000 houses by 2022. Though generally seen as part of the President’s effort to cement his legacy as he serves his second and final five-year term that also ends in 2022, it’s a worthy public goal. If the President achieves his personal goal and, in the process, helps others to get a roof over their heads, what would be wrong with that? This is also the first tangible proof of his commitment to the implementation of his ‘Big Four’ agenda. Its pillars are affordable housing, food security, universal health coverage and increasing the contribution of the manufacturing sector to 15 per cent of the gross domestic product. HIGH STANDARDS Estimates show that out of the 150,000 new housing units required yearly in the urban centres, only 35,000 are ever constructed. In the rural areas, many people live in hovels — not because of some traditional fascination but since they cannot afford anything better. But even as we welcome the tax relief, there is a need to review the obstacles to the building of houses, especially in the towns. One of the most glaring handicaps is the stringent approvals regime. While vetting is essential to maintain high standards and enhance safety, some of the building requirements and by-laws by the national and county governments need to be eased. Some of the demands on the people seeking to invest in housing end up creating room for graft as the officials granting the approvals profiteer. Enabling more Kenyans to own their homes is a worthy goal.
