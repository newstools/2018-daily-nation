The relationship between the Executive and the Legislature is headed for a collision course after senior government officials expressed their reservations over the number of times ministers are summoned by MPs. A senior member of the Executive who spoke in confidence to the Nation said Cabinet secretaries spend most of their time seeking answers and appearing in Parliament. This, they argue, was done away with by the 2010 Constitution. The issue is compounded by the fact that both Senate and National Assembly seem to be working at cross purposes since they at times could be investigating the same issue and send invites to a minister to appear before their committees at same time. The two Houses are investigating the Ruaraka land saga, Solai dam tragedy, Kenya Airways probe and several others. The chairman of the Senate ad hoc committee on Solai dam tragedy Senator Mutula Kilonzo said the issue can be sorted out by the two Speakers agreeing on what each House should look into. He, however, said Parliament will not shy away from summoning ministers on matters that are of national importance.
