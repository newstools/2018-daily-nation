Kwale Girls were on Saturday crowned the Under-19 girls' football champions at this year's National Secondary Schools Term Two Games at the Hill School, Eldoret. The Coast-based school beat Archbishop Njenga from Western Region 4-1 in the final to secure their maiden national title at their second appearance at the nationals. Last year, Kwale failed to get past the preliminary stage in Nyeri. The result saw them exact revenge on their opponents who beat them 3-1 in the preliminary stage. A brace from forward Saumu Baya and another goal from Lucy Kwekwe gave Kwale a comfortable 3-1 lead at the break. Anna Arusi had pulled one back for the 2011 champions, but Elizabeth Katungwa put the result beyond doubt with a 58th minute strike. Kwale coach Mukasa Amboko believes his charges totally deserved to win after improving with every match. "Since we lost the opening game, our attitude has completely changed and the girls have fought to make amends for that loss and that is what carried us through," the coach said. The two finalists alongside the third team will represent the country at the regional games next month in Musanze, Rwanda. Kwale had beaten Kobala 3-2 in the semis as Archbishop Njenga saw off Nginda Girls 2-0 in the other last four encounter. Last year's champions Wiyeta fell at the preliminary stage. KWANTHANZE REIGN In the girls' under -16 final, new champions were also crowned as debutantes Moi Girls Nangili shocked 2016 winners Wiyteta Girls 2-0 in the final. Goals from Now Oruko and Felistas Atieno saw the newcomers upset the form book. Kwanthanze retained their girls' volleyball crown after seeing off Soweto Academy in straight sets of 25-20, 25-20, 25-20 in the final clash. It is the regional champions' fourth national title. Cheptil secured third spot after defeating Bishop Sulumeti.
