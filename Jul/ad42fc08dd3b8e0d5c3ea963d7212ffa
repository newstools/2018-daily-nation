Two Cuban doctors have arrived in Isiolo as the county government embarks on plans to revamp health services. Their arrival comes amid plans by the administration to spend Sh100 million to renovate the 100-bed Isiolo County Referral Hospital. Isiolo County Governor Mohamed Kuti who welcomed the doctors, a surgeon and a family medicine specialist, said the two will be based at Isiolo Level IV Hospital but will be moving to sub county hospitals as needed. The doctors, Jose Antonio Sanchez 32, and Teobaldo Arencibia Junco 52, will start work official on Monday. The two medics have also worked in Venezuela and Jamaica. Mr Kuti, who is also a medical doctor, said respiratory tract infections, infectious and non-communicable diseases are common in the region. “The doctors came at a very important time when the county is trying to revamp health service in the region,” said Mr Kuti. The county has one Level IV hospital, two sub-county hospitals and more than 50 dispensaries located in remote areas.   Misango wants the court to bar the Immigration Department from issuing the specialists with work permits.
