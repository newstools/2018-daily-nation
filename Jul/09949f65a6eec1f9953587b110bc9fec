Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) President John Kameta has announced he will not defend his position in the next elections due in September. Kameta, loved and hated in equal measure by boxing fraternity, has been BAK boss for one term. While making the announcement, Kameta said he had no regrets as he was leaving the position proud of his achievements. “I have done my part and it is high time another person takes over and improve on my good record as the first President of BAK,” said Kameta in an exclusive interview with the Nation Sport. He added: “It has always been my wish to leave the hot seat at my own pleasure instead of waiting to be shown the door through elections and I am happy I have done that.” He said he had achieved a lot in rejuvenating the leadership of the sport and boxers’ welfare. “BAK had no structured communication system and it is during my time that a vibrant website was set up,” he said. At the same time, he said it was during his stay in the office that local coaches had a rare opportunity of attending Amateur professional boxing course in Italy. He said the National Boxing League had a lucrative sponsorship deal with the giant betting firm SportPesa. “SportPesa sponsorship deal which I pushed to the end has helped to improve boxing standards which saw a total of 16 clubs participate in the national boxing league last year,” said Kameta. “I consider the female boxers' exploits my biggest achievement,” he said in regard to Christine Ongare's bronze medal in 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia. “Changing the Noc-K constitution through BAK was a positive step. Now anyone in office will be accountable.”
