Your bedroom is the one room in your house where you spend most of your time in, right? Sleeping, relaxing, bonding with loved ones, reading or watching movies... Bedrooms also tend to be the place where you store most of your items, be it clothes, beddings, shoes or jewellery. If it is small and crowded, that could be a problem. But a well-organised bedroom can be soothing, relaxing and even a form of a stress reliever. Here are ways you can use to maximise that tiny space:  Invest in shelves all around your room. Shelves around the bedâ€™s headboard come in handy especially for storing books. Floor-to-ceiling shelves maximise on space. Shelves that replace head-boards and corner shelves are creative storage spaces. You can also remove the headboard for space. Remember to colour code what-ever you put on the shelves and to leave space for an airy look.    Hooks should be your best friend if you have a small bed-room. They have so many uses! Place them behind doors, on walls and closets, and you have storage space for your jewellery, towels and even shoes.    Allow light into the room to give it more character and make it look bigger. Avoid curtains if you can, or simply use sheers if privacy is really important for you. Window seats instead of normal seats in a bedroom create space, and could increase storage when you install drawers in them.  But when all is said and done, organisation is key. Even as you try some of these tips, remember that how you organise all your items makes a huge difference.
