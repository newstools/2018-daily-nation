Former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo wants a court to compel Nairobi County government settle his Sh250 million debt. Through his company, Kuza Farm and Allied Limited, Mr Jirongo says the devolved government declined to pay the debt despite committing to do so. Mr Jirongo says the devolved government allocated his land to third parties in 2008. The National Land Commission has confirmed that Mr Jirongo is the owner of the parcel. Mr Jirongo says Nairobi County sought an opinion from the Attorney-General and was informed that the land belongs to him. CONSENT JUDGMENT “The parties appeared at the High Court on July 28, 2016...and a negotiated consent judgment was entered,” Mr Jirongo adds. The express terms of the consent judgment were that the Governor, Nairobi County and the county Finance executive were to pay him the amount within 50 days, "which ought to have been September 15, 2016". “I have been to City Hall more than 50 times but have constantly been told to wait as the devolved government is experiencing financial challenges,” Mr Jirongo says. BANKRUPT In October, the High Court directed Mr Jirongo to pay Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Francis Atwoli Sh110 million he owes him. Mr Jirongo asked Mr Atwoli to wait until the Nairobi County government settles his debt, but the plea. He was again declared bankrupt by a court for failing to pay a Sh700 million debt to Mr Sammy Boit arap Kogo. Mr Jirongo contested the repeat presidential election on October 26, 2017 when the order was temporarily lifted. The case against the Nairobi County government will be mentioned on October 2.   Despite his big ambitions the controversial businessman owes some of his close friends and associates millions of shillings.
