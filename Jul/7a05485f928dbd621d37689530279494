Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti has refuted claims that there is a rift between him and his deputy Abdi Issa, terming them as baseless rumours. The two county heads said their working relationship is intact as they shook hands in public. Both were presiding over the launch of Sh20 million mobility carts and other devices for the disabled, a project supported by Partners for Care in conjunction with the county government. NO FALLING-OUT Dr Kuti and Dr Issa publicly insisted that there has not been any falling-out or differences between them, saying they did not have time for rumours but were focused in development activities to uplift the living standard of Isiolo people. A section of locals had claimed that the relationship between the two leaders was cold, claiming that the deputy governor had been side-lined barely a year after they assumed office. Others saw it as a replica of the previous county administration whose top leaders were publicly known to have read from different scripts.   NO TIME TO WASTE “Let the people of Isiolo know that we do not have any differences; we don’t have time to waste. Instead, my deputy and I are working together to deliver services and develop our county,” said the governor. The deputy county boss said the rumours going round had caused confusion among Isiolo people. “The governor is my mentor, he is a politician and I always consult him. I am his principal assistant and I respect him. He is my leader and there is no difference and when he orders me to jump I ask how high I should jump,” said the deputy governor, also the County Health executive. Dr Issa told individuals who are busy looking for differences between him and Dr Kuti to divert their mission to other counties. County Secretary Ahmed Galgalo, who also attended the event at Almasi Children Home for the handicapped, also affirmed the words of the two top county leaders.
