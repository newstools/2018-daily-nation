Police are seeking orders to obtain DNA samples from a man charged in connection with the murder of a lecturer following emergence of new details. A post-mortem on the body of Ms Irene Jepchumba Boitt, a lecturer at Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology in Nakuru, revealed that she was strangled to death. This was contrary to earlier claims that she had drowned after sliding down the Choka Falls on the River Molo where her body was found two weeks ago. Following the new revelations, police now want the court to allow them to subject the suspect, Mr Godfrey Kipkemoi Kangogo, to a DNA test. Mr Kangogo has already been charged with her murder. In the application made on July 18, the investigating officer, Mr John Gitau, seeks permission to collect saliva, hair, buccal swab and finger nails from the suspect for DNA testing. “I pray for the court to issue orders that we be allowed to take the samples from the suspect so that we can compare them with those of the deceased which were collected during post-mortem,” read part of the application. Mr Kangogo, who was arraigned before court on July 20, has denied killing Ms Boitt on July 6, 2018 at Choka Falls. According to the police report, Mr Kipkemboi was with the deceased when the incident occurred. He had earlier claimed that Ms Boitt, who was his girlfriend, slid and fell down the falls while taking a selfie. The suspect was arrested on July 12 at Kiamunyi after the results of the post-mortem were released. Nakuru Resident Magistrate Yvone Khatambi referred the application to the High Court where the suspect was charged. The case will resume on July 30.
