The Court of Appeal has thrown out a petition against Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama. Justice Stephen Gatembu on Thursday pointed out that the issues raised by Jubilee Party candidate Walter Nyambati did not affect the outcome of the election as declared by the electoral commission. Justice Gatembu also slapped the appellant with a total penalty of Sh3 million to be paid to Governor Nyagarama and the IEBC equally. Mr Nyambati had for the second time attempted to overturn Mr Nyagaramaâ€™s win a few months after High Court Judge James Makau quashed the petition filed before him in Nyamira on February 27. Mr Nyambati was Nyagarama's closest rival after he garnered 58,936 votes. The governor won after garnering 65,161. In his judgement, the judge also ruled that the petitioner failed to produce evidence for his allegations with most being based on mere suspicion. Justice Makau stated that the irregularities found during vote scrutiny were insufficient to invalidate Mr Nyagarama's victory.   Lawyer Gilbert Nyamweya said John Nyagarama is the rightful winner.
