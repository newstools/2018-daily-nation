Germany-based Maria Brunlehner struck two gold medals and a silver in swimming to hand Kenya its first medals as Africa Youth Games entered sixth day on Monday in Algiers, Algeria. Brunlehner, who represented Kenya at Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, tore the waters for victories in girls’ 100m and 50m freestyle respectively adding up to her silver in 50m breaststroke. On Sunday, Brunlehner clocked 58.87 seconds to claim gold in the 100m freestyle, a victory that warmed her up for the 50m freestyle feat on Monday where she broke the championship record with new times of 26.14 in 500m freestyle. That feat saw her missing her elder sister Sylvia’s national record of 25.85 by a whisker. Brunlehner edged out Ines Barbouch from Tunisia and Egyptian Enjy El Marasy to win the 100m freestyle contest. Barbouch tapped the wall in 59.26 for silver while El Marasy timed 59.39 for bronze. Brunlehner had on Sunday finished second in the 50m breaststroke fray in 34.04 seconds to lose the battle to Moroccan Imane Houda El Barodi, who tapped the wall in 33.03. SETTLED FOR BRONZE Nesrine Jelliti from Tunisia settled for bronze in the 50m breaststroke in 34.10. In boys’ hockey, Kenya crushed Namibia 3-1 on Monday to advance to the semi-finals. Goals from Bryton Ndwati, Edson Ndombi and Bryan Ogenche put Kenya through. The hockey team started the championships badly, going down to Zambia and Nigeria in identical 2-1 losses. They got a walk over against Uganda in the last and final pool match. That saw them finish third and get a lifeline to the quarterfinals. In boys’ beach volleyball; Brian Kimeli and Kelvin Wafula won three of their four matches to earn a place in the quarterfinals. The young Kenyans crushed Sudan and Togo in identical straight sets of 2-0 before they silenced Nigeria 2-1 to sail through despite having lost to Algeria 2-0. BEACH VOLLEYBALL In girls’ beach volleyball; Juliet Makokha and Gloria Nekesa’s campaign was jolted when they won one match against DR Congo 2-1 before losing to Cameroon (2-0), Sierra Leone (2-0) and Rwanda (2-1). The much-awaited athletics calendar starts on Tuesday with  Zenah Jemutai and Mercy Chepkorir battling in women’s 3,000m final at 8pm Kenyan time. Athletics team manager Eliud Wambua said that Kenya has been allowed to field two athletes in some events after countries had protested last minute changes. Maxon Kipng’etich and Jones Wambua will take part in boys’ 100m heats with Beatrice Anyango battling in girls’ 100m qualifying round. Samwel Mwita and Judy Jepkoech take off the blocks in boys’ and girls’ 400m heats respectively while Nickson Lesiyia will compete in boys’ 1,500m first round.
