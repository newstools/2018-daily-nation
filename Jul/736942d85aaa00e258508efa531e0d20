Francis Keshoo Pesi and Fancy Cherono struck gold for Kenya in the boys’ 800m and girls 2,000m steeplechase respectively as Africa Youth Games entered its penultimate stage on Friday in Algiers, Algeria. Pesi clocked 1 minutes and 50.72 seconds to triumph in boys’ 800m final, edging out Moroccan Mohamed Abouettahery and Tasew Yada Mulu from Ethiopia to silver and bronze in 1.51.12 and 1.51.52 respectively. Then Cherono, who represented Kenya at Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, would comfortably go for the girls’ steeplechase honours in 6:17.68, beating Ethiopian Abebe Demewoz by 10 seconds. Demowoz clocked 6:26.86 to edge out Uganda’s Esther Yego to silver in 6:41.23. Javelin thrower Ita Nao fell short of replicating compatriot Martha Nthanze Musai’s historic feat in girls’ javelin when he was forced to settle for silver in the boys’ final. Pesi, Cherono and Nao’s exploits wrapped up Kenya's track action with 11 medals: four gold, three silver and four bronze. Musai made history with her victory in girls’ javelin while Nickson Lesiyia Pariken romped to victory in boys’ 1,500m. Samuel Mwita lost the battle in boys’ 400m where he settled sixth in the final in 48.96 as Zambian Kennedy Luchembe won gold in 46.21, beating Bernard Olesitse from Botswana and Ghanaian Solomon Diafo in 47.00 and 47.48 respectively. Hopes of clinching bronze in boys’ tennis doubles went up in smoke when Albert Njogu and Sheil Kotecha lost to the hosts 2-1. Overall, Kenya had 15 medals: six gold, three silver and five bronze after Maria Maria Brunlehner won two gold medals and silver in girls’ swimming with the boys’ hockey team settling for bronze.
