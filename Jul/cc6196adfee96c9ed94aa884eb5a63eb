Police in Nakuru on Tuesday seized about 3,000 rolls of bhang in Mbaruk along the Nakuru-Nairobi highway as they beefed up the war on drug trafficking. The haul, estimated to have a street value of Sh1.2 million, was destined for Nairobi. The bhang was seized by security personnel from the Police Operational Intelligence Unit. Nakuru Town East Deputy County Commissioner Herman Shambi said the suspects who were transporting it escaped and a manhunt for them was immediately launched. SUSPECTS ESCAPE "Police officers on patrol on the Nakuru-Nairobi highway approached a Toyota Fielder car whose passengers appeared suspicious and ordered [it] to stop. The driver of the vehicle halted and two suspects escaped into a nearby bush," Mr Shambi said. The administrator said police are hunting for the two suspects who escaped on foot and left behind their vehicle, KBH 676Z. According to police, the bhang is suspected to have been ferried from a neighbouring country through western Kenya. WARNING Mr Shambi warned people transporting illegal materials using the route that they will be arrested and prosecuted. “Police also have information that the drugs are sold to children and could be behind the increased arson attacks in schools. We will pursue all those involved to ensure they face the full force of the law,” said Mr Shambi. “Parents also, we must observe [their] children especially as we head to the holiday season because maybe some of the indiscipline cases we have been hearing in schools are related to this,” he added. Police also said they have launched investigations to arrest the owner of the vehicle that was transporting the bhang.
