Two children have died and seven family members suffered serious burns after gas cylinder exploded in their house in Narok town. Narok Police boss Joseph Kisompe said the two children were among nine family members who were in the two-bedroom house when the gas cylinder exploded. Mr Kisompe said the survivors were taken to Kenyatta National Hospital for specialised treatment after having sustained more than 70 percent degree burns. Neighbours said the family had just ordered a new gas cylinder but whoever changed the cylinder failed to tighten the regulator which started leaking. Once the leaking gas came into contact with flames from a nearby charcoal stove, it exploded into a huge inferno that engulfed the whole house, the neighbours said. Ms Gladys Ogembo, a neighbour, said they put off the fire using water from a nearby tank since the fire brigade did not respond promptly. The victims were first taken to Narok Referral Hospital but were later rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital for specialised treatment. Explosion occured the family's two-room house in Majengo Estate on Monday morning.
