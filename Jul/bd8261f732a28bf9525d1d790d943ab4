Hi Brenda, I am in love with a kind and sweet guy. However, he told me that he is not ready for a relationship at the moment despite saying that he likes me a lot. He is such a great friend to have and I do not want to lose him just because of my raging hormones. How do I take things slow?  What this kind and sweet guy is not telling you is that he is not ready for a relationship with you. Those are the two words missing at the end. Kindly figure out how to redirect your emotions because your feelings are currently falling onto barren land. There is no germination happening here. You see, if someone wants you, they want you, regardless of whether or not they are ready for a relationship – in the same way that you confessed your feelings to him and he had the opportunity to tell you no (not yet is the same as no, sorry). When a guy likes you, either they're clear, or not. If they're not clear, they're probably not there or are messing around – even kind, sweet guys can be game players. Hormones are a dime a dozen. Transfer them to someone else, because he's just not that into you. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
