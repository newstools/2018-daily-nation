Champions Kenya Commercial Bank launched their Prinsloo Sevens defence in emphatic fashion at Nakuru Athletics Club on Saturday. In their opening match of this first leg of the Stanbic Bank national circuit, the swift bankers flattened rookies Webuye 36-0. The bankers stepped up their campaign in their second match when they safely locked Nondies 31-14 to firmly stay on course to enter the Cup quarters. Menengai Oilers made good use of their home ground when they buried Catholic Monks 36-0, sunk Mombasa 31-7 before demolishing Resolution Impala Saracens 24-19. It was a sad outing for the coastal side when they crashed 26-0 by Impala in their second match. Kenya Harlequin opened their title chase with a hard fought 12-12 draw with Kenyatta University Blak Blad. Great Rift 10-a-side rugby 2018 Menengai Cream Homeboyz were in a class of their own as they danced past hapless Kisumu 30-5. The Deejays followed this victory with another big win 31-0 against Blak Blad. However, Menengai Cream Homeboyz met their waterloo in their third match of the day when they were beaten by SportPesa sponsored Kenya Harlequin 21-7. Stanbic Bank-sponsored Mwamba RFC were made to use every trick in the book before squeezing a 26-17 victory past Strathmore Leos. However, in their second tie Mwamba found the going tough when they lost 17-7 to Kabras Sugar before raising their game to beat Mean Machine 14-7. Kabras Sugar edged out Mean Machine 12-10 while last year's losing finalists Top Fry Nakuru outplayed Nondies 29-7 and in their second game Nakuru hit Webuye 19-5. Impala walloped Catholic Monks 40-0. The Monks recovered from their poor show to beat Mombasa 17-14 while Kisumu humbled Blak Blad 21-7. Kenya Harlequins beat Kisumu 10-5 and in a battle of students, Mean Machine overcame Strathmore 43-14.
