The Nation Media Group will today host a major career fair for high school students and Form Four leavers seeking places in universities and tertiary colleges. The fair will be held at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi, from 8.30am to 6 pm. It is open to students, school leavers, parents, guardians and teachers as well as career specialists and talent recruitment experts. The objective is to give guidance on career choices to high school students and all others seeking opportunities in higher education institutions. OFFER TIPS Managers of higher education institutions will be available to give tips on career options, including where they are tenable, costs involved and job placement opportunities. They will also talk about the capacity of the universities and colleges in terms of numbers and courses they offer. The fair seeks to fill a void in the education system where school leavers are left on their own to make decisions on careers but without information and correct advice. The fair will prepare Form Four candidates for selection of university and college courses that is scheduled for the third term. In addition, universities and colleges will be admitting students in September, so this is the appropriate time for the qualifiers to understand what awaits them ahead. SUSTAIN INTEREST Successful career depends on proper planning. Students are better placed when they know the reason they are choosing particular courses or programmes, how long it takes to study it, the fees and the job prospects. Also, it rests on the ability of the student to pursue the course and sustain interest in it. Last year, there were 611,959 candidates who sat the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), and 70,073 obtained grade C+, which is the minimum entry point to university. A total of 62,851 were selected to join the universities.
