In Kenya, a census is conducted every 10 years by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). Kenya’s first census was conducted in 1948. This was 23 years after the colonial government appointed its first official statistician. According to the last census carried out by KNBS in 2009, Kenya’s population stood at 38, 610,097 -- a 10-million spike from the 1999 census that showed Kenya’s population to be 28 million. In 2016, KNBS published a report on the projected population of Kenya and it stood at 45.8 million. KNBS is currently preparing to carry out the eighth census in Kenya’s history, that will be held in August 2019. As we gear up to mark World Population Day on July 11, let us look at the seven most populated counties in Kenya as recorded in the 2009 census while comparing the numbers with the population projections published in a report by KNBS in 2016.  1.
