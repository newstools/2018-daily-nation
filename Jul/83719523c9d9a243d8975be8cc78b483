The much awaited Opich Pacho Mpira Mashinani football tournament will start this weekend in Kisumu County. The Kisumu County Government and Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL) announced a partnership on Wednesday that will see 35 teams across the county battle it out in the seven-a-side tournament. The tournament will however not include a women's competition, while the participants must be tween 21-30 years. No players who are currently attached to SportPesa Premier League or National Super League clubs will be allowed to take part in the tournament. The 35 teams have been pooled into nine groups in the competition which will be staged at the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground and Moi Stadium. The tournament will take place for the next three weekends with the final being held on August 4 where the winning team will take home Sh300,000 while the first and second runners up will receive Sh200,000 and Sh100,000 respectively. Each match will last only 60 minutes. "It is proper for us (KBL) to be involved in developing future talent and by extension support the community in finding alternative sources of income. For us (KBL) it is an honour to be part of the sponsors of this tournament and we hope it will have some positive change among youth in this place,” KBL Director of Corporate Affairs Erick Kiniti said. “Through Opich Pacho, talented youth who want to be great players may achieve their dream as they may be recruited by the big clubs,” Kisumu County Director of Sports Kenneth Otieno said.
