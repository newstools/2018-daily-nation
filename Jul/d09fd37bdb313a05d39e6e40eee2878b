NIZHNY NOVGOROD Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani was ruled out of the World Cup quarter-final against France in Nizhny Novgorod on Friday because of injury. Cristhian Stuani, a former Middlesbrough striker, was drafted in to replace Cavani after he failed to recover in time from the calf muscle injury he sustained in the 2-1 win over Portugal last Saturday, when the Paris Saint-Germain forward scored both goals. Cavani was listed as "injured" in the official Fifa starting line-ups. France also had to make a change, bringing in Corentin Tolisso because of Blaise Matuidi's suspension. Matuidi picked up a second yellow card for the tournament in France's thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.Bayern Munich midfielder Tolisso is preferred to Lyon's Nabil Fekir. It is only Tolisso's 12th start for his country.
