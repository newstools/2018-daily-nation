An irate mob in Kinondo village, Kwale County has lynched a police officer on suspicion of being a thief. Two others escaped from the angry mob. The angry mob descended on the officer Saturday evening with crude weapons, kicks and blows, killing him on the spot. Kwale County Commissioner Karuku Ngumo said the three officers attached to Msambweni DCI, while on duty, went to inspect suspected contraband sugar at Tawakal shop in Kinondo trading centre where they were attacked by members of the public. Mr Ngumo said as the officers were entering the shop, they were confronted by the angry mob on suspicion of being thieves. LOOKED SUSPICIOUS According to locals, the officers looked suspicious after failing to introduce and identify themselves. This attracted the attention of members of the public who became rowdy and agitated and started attacking them. "One officer was lynched as the other two officers and a taxi driver escaped with minor injuries," said Mr Ngumo, adding that police have launched investigations into the matter. He condemned the killing of the officer and cautioned members of the public against taking the law into their own hands. He added that those involved in the killing will be severely punished by the law. The body was taken to Msambweni County Referral Hospital mortuary.
