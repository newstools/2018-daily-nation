If there is any proposal that the government must outrightly reject, it is the suggestion that all primary and secondary schools should have a common uniform. Basic Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang has stunned the nation by revealing that the government is considering a proposal by the Kenya Parents Association to introduce a single school uniform. School uniforms are a mark of identity, and an embodiment of the heritage of every institution. Current students and the old boys and girls have a sentimental attachment to their school uniforms. It would be grossly unfair to drown them in the sea of uniformity. Those behind this idea are in for a tough fight. NATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS A policy that is bound to have serious national ramifications should not be so casually handled. This raises a number of questions. Did the KPA consult parents countrywide before coming up with this proposal? What is it intended to redress? Do the different uniforms undermine performance in national examinations? Indeed, a school uniform is a source of inspiration just like the corporate colours of an organisation. There has lately been tendency in the Education ministry towards some kind of centralisation. This uniform talk echoes the directive to have all school buses painted yellow. It was resisted, but the government bulldozed its way. TEXTBOOKS POLICY The other is the common textbooks policy. But there is no compelling reason why the Starehe Centres, Alliances, Allidina Visrams and others should give up their colours. Indeed, the uniform is also a tool to enforce discipline as when students sneak out of school, they can be easily identified. Or could this new move be linked to a business deal, with someone already eyeing a huge tender to supply uniforms. There are enough challenges in schools and there is absolutely no need to create even more confusion with this needless single uniform proposal.
