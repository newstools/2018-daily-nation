Two people died in Kashani village in Kisauni, Mombasa after a quarry they were in collapsed and buried them alive. On Wednesday Kashani residents were still coming to terms with the deaths of 28-year-old Rajab Kazungu and 30-year-old Ali Kaingu. The two died on Tuesday afternoon. Rajab died on the spot awhile Kaingu died as locals rushed him to the Coast General Hospital. The two were among three harvesters who were scooping sand from the river bed. The third victim, 21-year-old Hemed Shida was injured, treated and discharged. SAFETY Bamburi MCA Robert Nyiro said the incident was a wake-up call for the youth to desist from going into the quarries until their safety is guaranteed. "It is an extremely sad day for us as the residents of Bamburi. Loosing such young souls in this manner is bad. However, I think for now, you just need to stay away from these quarries because they are not safe anymore. “I know this is one of the areas you get your daily bread from but it is now getting extremely dangerous,” he said. The MCA was accompanied by her Mtopanga counterpart Lucy Chizi. A witness Khamis Ali said the two had gone to the quarry to scoop sand in the afternoon when the tragedy happened. "There was a crack and a loud bang then we heard noise and screaming. We rushed to the scene and tried to rescue the three. They had been trapped and one of them had already died,” he said.
