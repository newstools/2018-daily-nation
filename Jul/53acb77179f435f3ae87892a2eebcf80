Traditional football arch-rivals Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards clash tomorrow in a potentially explosive SportPesa Premier League match at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Potentially explosive on the pitch because both sides are in a rich vein of form; Gor riding on the crest of a convincing 4-0 midweek victory over Tanzania’s Yanga in the CAF Confederation Cup and Leopards with their claws out after six wins and three draws from their last 10 outings of the local league. The “Mashemeji Derby” has in recent times lived up to its infamous tag of a rabble-rousing fixture; the last time round fans from the two clubs visiting heavy damage on the Kasarani match venue prompting a near ban from the stadium’s management. This shouldn’t happen again. We exhort the two sets of fans to demonstrate some decorum tomorrow as only a peaceful fixture will entice more converts through the turnstiles and transform this into a family fixture where one would be comfortable in the stands with children in tow. Fans should heed the plea from their captains Harun Shakava (Gor) and Duncan Otieno (Leopards) for sanity to prevail, regardless the final score. After all, it’s just a game of football, and not a matter of life and death. It’s such sanity that will also lure sponsors to jump onto the bandwagon and support these top clubs that endure perennial financial problems. That’s why we implore “K’Ogalo” and “Ingwe” supporters to remain level-headed in the 90 minutes and beyond tomorrow. Give football a chance and let peace prevail.
