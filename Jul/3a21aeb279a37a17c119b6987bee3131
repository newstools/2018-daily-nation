Police are investigating the theft of over Sh20m from Family Bank in Ruiru over the weekend, OCPD James Ngetich has said. The bank on Monday released a statement, saying it reported the break-in to relevant authorities and that the robbery is under investigation. "We wish to inform our customers that our Ruiru branch is fully operational and open for business," said the bank's statement. A source who requested anonymity has said three managers based at the branch and a security guard have been arrested and are being grilled over the theft that local residents said they were not even aware of. Mr Ng'etich snubbed journalists who had been waiting for a briefing over the incident since 9am, telling them he had urgent matters to attend to.
