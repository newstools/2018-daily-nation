Police in Marsabit are looking for three girls aged between nine and 14 whom they say were abducted and married off. The girls were abducted in Kurkum and Kargi in Marsabit County. Speaking to the Nation on Tuesday, Loiyangalani Deputy County Commissioner Enock Nyarango warned parents and chiefs of taking part in the abduction of girls. "Most of the times, parents do not report these cases and chiefs are also accomplices since they do not follow up the cases seriously," Mr Nyarango said. The administrator said there could be monetary transactions between the parents, local authorities and the abductors. He pointed out that such cases have been on the increase. "No one is allowed to marry underage girls. That is the main reason the girls are abducted, yet parents do not report. We will spare no one if they are found to have participated in such," said Mr Nyarango. Early marriages have not ceased among pastoralist communities and are currently done in secret.   To the men, a girl is property they can dispose off at will for a few cows.
