The government’s plan to seek approval by Parliament to hive off nearly 5,000 hectares of Mt Elgon Forest to resettle the landless sends the wrong signal about its commitment to the crucial matter of forest conservation. It’s an ironical move by the same government, which has lately reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the country’s water towers. Stunned by the widespread destruction of the Mau Forest Complex, some decisive action has been taken. The authorities are evicting illegal squatters to enable the restoration of this major water tower. It’s a decision that has been fully endorsed by many, who see the plight of the few invaders in the water catchment area as only secondary to the greater benefits of conserving it. CONSERVATION The question many are now asking is why the government would wish to sanction the destruction of one water tower while taking stringent measures to conserve another. It is not surprising, therefore, that environmentalists, other activists and some politicians are up in arms over the excision of 4,607 hectares of Mt Elgon Forest, which would entail cutting down many trees and a lot of other vegetation. Also, a ban on logging in the forests, which was announced by Deputy President William Ruto several months ago, is in place. This was in response to the widespread destruction of forests countrywide. The government should not be sending mixed signals on such a matter of vital national importance. Whereas all citizens have a right to shelter and, therefore, a piece of land on which to erect it, there is a need to rationalise this so that the benefit for a few does not undermine the interests, safety and comfort of the majority. We hope the MPs will reject the request as it would be foolhardy to rush to solve a problem and end up creating an even more serious one.
