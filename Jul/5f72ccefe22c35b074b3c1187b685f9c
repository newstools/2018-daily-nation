The government has given the Chinese operator of the Mombasa-Nairobi  Madaraka Express 72 hours to respond to claims of mistreatment of local staff. Kenya Railways (KR) wants China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) to file a report on the alleged mistreatment. In a press statement, the corporation said it will also conduct its own investigation. “Kenya Railways has launched investigations into alleged incidents of mistreatment of local staff employed to facilitate operations at the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) being undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) under an operations & maintenance services contract entered into by the parties in May, 2017,” KR said. “We have instructed the Standard Gauge Railway operator, China Road and Bridge Corporation, to submit a report within 72 hours for critical review against what is in the public domain,” the statement said. The directive follows media reports of mistreatment of local staff by the Chinese firm. “We have also deployed our human resources team to engage with the local staff to independently establish the authenticity of these allegations.” Kenya Railways said the reports have elicited strong emotions from the public. "The outrage, anger and disappointment expressed is understandable and we share the same sentiments. This unethical conduct, if found to be authentic, is completely unacceptable,” KR said. The SGR operations were commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta on May 31, 2017. KR and CRBC signed an operation, maintenance and service agreement for the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR operation. CRBC hired locals alongside Chinese workers as security personnel, train drivers and wagon technicians. The deal will see CRBC maintaining the equipment and rail tracks for a period of 10 years. The Chinese firm is also expected to hire 1,000 Kenyans in various positions to eventually take over the operations after the deal ends.
