Kenyans using service provider Safaricom were not able to access the internet on Sunday for a better part of the day. Several subscribers took to Twitter to voice their concerns over the outage, with some complaining they had bought internet bundles several times yet they could not browse the internet. "What's not happening with internet connection? [It has] been off since 8am in Donholm area? [I] have restarted over and over!" @barassah tweeted Safaricom. Safaricom released a statement linking the outage to fiber link cuts that "affected critical transmission equipment." "This has resulted in loss of voice and SMS services in Coast and lower eastern regions as well as general data unavailability across the network, affecting services operated through the internet," said Safaricom. The firm said it is working to restore the service as soon as possible and apologised to affected customers.   Mobile phone scammers have defrauded many Kenyans of their hard-earned money.
