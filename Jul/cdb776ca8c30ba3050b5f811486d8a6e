Complaints by parents that private schools are overcharging them for educational trips raise a pertinent question about whether it is time to introduce some form of regulation in the management of private institutions. According to a report in the Sunday Nation, parents accused private school managers of charging for trips impulsively instead of using standard principles based on distance and additional levies. Although the Kenya Private Schools Heads Association has dismissed the claims, saying the institutions take into account many variables in coming up with the figures, which it describes as generally reasonable, there is clearly a case for robust debate about the extent to which schools can go in determining various charges. UNIFORMITY While public schools operate under a stringent regulatory framework that ensures a sense of uniformity in the way they are run, private schools enjoy a more liberal environment that allows them to set their own rules as long as they stick to the curriculum and examination rules. This obviously means that the management of private schools could be open to abuse, especially when it comes to charging for extra-curricular activities. INVOLVE PARENTS For a start, the schools should be magnanimous enough to involve parents in decisions involving charges outside tuition fees, especially because these are never declared in fees guidelines.In the long term, however, the education authorities must determine if there is a need for closer supervision of private schools to protect parents from undue exploitation, the integrity of the tuition and the learners themselves.
