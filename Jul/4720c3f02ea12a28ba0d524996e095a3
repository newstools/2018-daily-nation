Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has sacked two county ministers over alleged corruption and suspended a third over failure to account for bursary funds. The sacked ministers, Ms Marita Agufuna (Sports) and Mr Alfred Indeche (Finance), were impeached by the county assembly on Monday for transferring Sh18.8 million to a private account. The duo allegedly transferred the public funds at the end of the 2017/18 Financial Year to hide it from the National Treasury. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi told journalists at the county headquarters in Mbale that his boss had fired the two ministers as a commitment his administration was ready to facilitate investigations into the alleged corruption. Ms Felistus Okumu, the Education boss, has been sent on three-month compulsory leave after her department failed to account for Sh3 million allocated for bursaries.
