The revelation by police that drugs could be fuelling the recent increase in cases of defilement and killing of little girls in Murang’a County is a grave matter that calls for serious investigations. This is a finding that has also apparently been corroborated by some experts who have investigated the macabre deaths of four girls in one month. One family found that the killer had even removed some of their slain daughter’s body parts. One of the villages where a number of defilement cases have been reported is said to be notorious for bhang smoking by youths and even some elderly men. Parents are in a panic because they do not know who could be the next victim and some are taking extraordinary measures to ensure that their children are not harmed. In some places, parents now accompany their children to school and wait for them until after classes to ensure that they are safe. It’s disheartening to hear from a local administrator that, even where suspects have been arrested, the cases collapse and they are set free after the victims fail to testify. This is not good enough. The administrators and the security personnel must do more to deter crime. Drug abuse, as has been documented in Mombasa and other places, drives youth into crimes as they seek money to sustain their destructive habits. The four Murang’a killings call for more serious investigations to flush out the culprits and bring them to book. We cannot have people who have committed such heinous crimes roaming the villages, even if they are high on drugs. The families of the four little angels who were killed in such a callous manner deserve justice. The cases that were discontinued because witnesses failed to testify should be revived.
