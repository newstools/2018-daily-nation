Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua on Friday appointed seven ministers despite lack of approval by the county assembly. Dr Mutua cited section 9 of the Public Appointments (County Assemblies Approval) Act, in making the appointments, saying the members are deemed to have been approved after the lapse of the 21 days from the date he submitted the names. Section 9 states: “Unless otherwise provided in any law, a committee shall consider a nomination and table its report in the County Assembly for debate and decision within twenty-one sitting days from the date on which the committee first sits to consider the nomination.” Mr Mutua said he made the appointments in the best interest of the Machakos people. He said the assembly rejected his initial five ministers after which he resubmitted to the assembly another list of nominees. "The assembly failed to approve the nominees within 21 days as required by the law," said Mutua. Mr Mutua spoke during a press conference outside his Machakos office where he was flanked by his deputy, Mr Francis Maliti. APPOINTEES Ms Evelyn Mutie has been appointed to take charge of the energy, lands, and housing docket while Mr Morris Aluanga will head the roads, transport and public works ministry. Mr Titus Nzeki will be in charge of the county administration and decentralised units while the former county secretary Francis Mwaka moves to the trade docket. Mr Kimeu Kimeu will head public service while Mr Urbanus Musyoka will lead the agriculture docket. Mr Lazarus Kivuva has been tapped to lead the education ministry.
