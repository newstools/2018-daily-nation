The government will not cater for the cost of property damages caused by student unrest in schools, Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has said. The CS on Thursday said school unrest and indiscipline will not be condoned and those found culpable will pay the full cost of the losses in the affected schools. Ms Mohamed said they have launched investigations across the country and a preliminary report will be availed before any action is taken. She said, schools affected by school fires  will remain closed until  the security situation is deemed safe. "Once investigations are  completed, we will determine if students involved in school unrest will sit for their National Exams," she said. She said, the ministry will have a meeting with stakeholders to access the security situation in schools and look at preliminary investigations. Kenya National of Teachers Union Wilson Sossion said teachers will not take responsibility of any damages caused by school unrest. Mr Sossion blamed the teachers service commission for transferring teachers hence the school unrest. Mr Sossion said delocalization of  teachers by the TSC is a major contributor to the school unrest that has been witnessed. " The buck square stops with the ministry of education and TSC in restoring sanity in schools as these are the sole bodies constitutionally charged with the mandate of framing policies that regulate schools and teachers including students discipline, said Mr Sossion. Mr Sossion said, what students are engaged in is unacceptable and criminal in nature. Next week, the CS is expected to appear before the Senate committee on education to shed light of the school unrest. The senate will be expecting to receive the intelligent report from the investigations done on schools unrest. Mr Sossion said, if the report will show that school unrest is due to teachers transfer, it is the policy maker that will take responsibility.
