Hi Brenda I am in love with my married colleague. I have turned him down several times because he is married. But he is really persistent. He’s been asking me out for two years. I know this is so wrong but I feel I’m losing it. I feel I am about to say yes, yet I shouldn’t. Please help me. Are you married too? If you are, you need to rapidly figure out if an affair is worth sacrificing your union for. Let's say you have an affair and your partner finds out. What happens? Do you want to be with this guy? Will he leave his wife for you? If you're not married, I suppose I could appeal to you, woman to woman, and ask you to consider the effects of karma, as well as how little you would appreciate it if this happened to you on the flip side, but I feel like you're past this point. So I suppose I will leave you with this. You're not the one who made those vows, but being complicit in something like this would be a severe lack in judgement, simply because it's easy for a married man to be persistent. He finishes being persistent with you and then goes home to his wife and children as you turn over everything he said that day to you. Go with what your gut says because if your gut thinks it's wrong, then your conscience probably will too. Find a distraction, quick, and analyse why this particular taken man appeals to you. Married men are rarely what they promise they're going to be. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
