Ten students from Materi Boys High School in Tharaka-Nithi County are being held at Marimanti Police Station in connection with burning of their school stall on Monday morning. Tharaka South Sub County OCPD Walter Obondo told the Nation that the Form Two students are being interrogated and will be arraigned once investigations are completed. “We are holding 10 boys at the station who are suspected to have torched the property,” said Mr Obondo. He said the burnt property whose value has not been established, included mattresses and books. He said initial investigations revealed that the students are not happy with the new principal whom they accuse of high-handedness. The officer said the Form Two students are accusing the principal of forcing them to select their specialisation subjects. “The students are arguing that with the former principal one could continue studying all the subjects and specialise when registering for Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education Examination,” said Mr Obondo. Area assistant chief Patrick Iguna said the fire was noticed too late when the house had already been burnt down. One of the residents who lives near the school, Mr John Mutegi, said students also complained of being fed with weevil-infested maize.
