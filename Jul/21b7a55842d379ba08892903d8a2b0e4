Jubilee’s much-touted schools laptop programme has virtually ground to a halt and it is time to take stock of what happened and what ought to have been done. The one-laptop-per-child programme, launched in 2013, was meant to put information and communication technology at the centre of teaching and learning in primary schools. While the idea was itself noble and timely, coming at a time when the world is experiencing a dizzying technological revolution, its implementation has been haphazard. First, when the official rollout was done in May 2016, the policy shifted from laptops to tablets, ostensibly due to cost implications, raising questions about the government’s preparedness and seriousness. REQUIRED SKILLS Despite huge allocations of cash, a government report released just two months ago revealed that, although many public schools have ICT facilities supplied through the Digital Literacy Learning Programme, only a few use them because many teachers lack the required skills. According to the report by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD), only 39 per cent of the teachers use ICT to teach despite having the facilities. Again, many schools have neither electricity nor access to the internet, making the programme unviable. DESPAIR The government is on the spot for allocating billions of shillings for a programme that was not well-thought-out. It is difficult to justify why it rushed headlong into such a grandiose project, while leaving the key implementers, the teachers, on the periphery. As thousands of tablets gather dust in school stores because teachers have no idea how to integrate them, many others have fallen into disrepair and no one knows how to fix them. The government ought to explain to the public why the project is on the verge of becoming a white elephant.
