National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale has dismissed calls by governors that they be given immunity against prosecution while in office. Instead, Mr Duale said, the county bosses should be prepared to be arraigned in court if they are involved in corruption. Mr Duale said the Council of Governors cannot intimidate or blackmail independent institutions that have been mandated by the Constitution to fight corruption. "Every officer working for the county and national government will be held accountable if public resources are wasted or corruptly gained. The Council of Governors cannot blackmail the Director of Public Prosecutions, DCI, and other independent bodies," said the Garissa Township MP in Garissa Town on Sunday. OJAAMONG ARREST He was reacting to recent remarks by the governors who took issue with the arrest of their colleague, Busia’s Sospeter Ojaamong on corruption charges. The governors want to be accorded immunity from prosecution similar to the one accorded to the President. "The only person enjoying immunity from prosecution under the Constitution is the President. From the deputy president and [other] state officers, [all] will be prosecuted if found with any wrongdoing," Mr Duale added. Mr Duale said governors cannot purport to enjoy powers which the Constitution has not given them, noting that the Busia governor was not the first one to be arraigned in court. He said that the buck stops with the governor “since they are the CEOs of the county and should be held directly responsible for any malpractices and economic crimes committed in their counties”. "There is no special treatment for the governors when they are being arrested and they should not expect any at all. The way an ordinary citizen is arrested is the same way a high profile figure will be arrested," said Mr Duale. He said that Parliament has put in place mechanisms to support the government in the war against corruption.
