Former Nyandarua Governor Daniel Waithaka and two others were on Friday morning arranged in a Nyahururu court over alleged Sh50 million graft case. Mr Waithaka, former Water minister Grace Gitonga and Mr Kihiu Gaiko, the sitting Water chief officer appeared before resident magistrate James Wanyanga but did not take plea since the court referred to Nakuru, citing lack of jurisdiction. The trio presented themselves to Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) officers in Nyeri on Thursday after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji issued arrest warrant against them over Sh50m project.   Mr Haji accused the trio of flouting procurement laws by commission a project without proper planning. The DPP said the public lost Sh50m after the tender was given to an Israeli firm, Tahal Limited, in 2014 for a sewerage system for Ol Kalou town.   EACC hunts for 2 other suspects.
