Labour Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani has been stopped from convening a National Social Security Fund (NSSF) board meeting, pending the hearing of a case filed by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) boss Francis Atwoli. Justice Byram Ongaya gave the order after Mr Atwoli filed an urgent case, saying the CS had failed to gazette and appoint Cotu nominee Damaris Wanjiru Muhika to the Board of Trustees. The judge certified the case urgent and directed Mr Atwoli’s lawyer Okweh Achiando to serve the papers to the CS, Attorney-General and NSSF board. The lawyer said the board was about to hold its first meeting with plans to consider various issues among them financial reports, approval of projects, advertise, interview and appoint the general managers of various departments, without the input of its nominee. Mr Atwoli said in a sworn statement that on March 26 he wrote to the CS drawing to his attention the need to appoint Ms Muhika as Cotu’s nominee to the board. He said it was only last week that Mr Yatani wrote back, saying he was still scrutinising the recommendations to check compliance with the constitutional requirements. But Mr Atwoli said the CS does not have such powers and the move was only meant to frustrate Cotu’s representation to the board.
