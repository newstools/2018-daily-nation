Some moments of madness in extra time saw Kenya Sevens squander their 28-5 lead to lose to Scotland 31-28 and fail to reach the Rugby World Cup Sevens quarterfinals in San Francisco, USA on Saturday. It was simply tragic and heartbreaking when Samuel Oliech and Samuel Njenga were sin-binned in quick succession to let Scotland, who were trailing 28-17 at the death, to win. The Scots quickly cashed in on their numbers with Jamie Farndale scoring a brace, with his last coming off a penalty try. Jamie Fergusson converted both to give them victory. Kenya stormed to first half's 14-0 lead when Eden Agero converted William Ambaka and Jeffrey Oluoch's tries. Then Collins Injera extended the lead 21-5 with a try that Oliech converted before Oluoch sealed a brace for a comfortable 28-5 lead with four minutes of play remaining. COMEBACK The Scots turned on the style with a thrilling comeback as Harvey Elms and Scott Riddell in 11th and 13th minutes. Fergusson converted one as they inched closer 28-17. Then the moments Oliech and Kenya would like to forget fast on their World Cup debut came. Oliech was send out for a high tackle with Njenga being sin-binned for some cynical play. Scotland will now meet the winner between South Africa and Ireland in the Cup quarterfinals.
