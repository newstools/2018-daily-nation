The Coast Water Services Board has disrupted water supply to Taita Taveta County due to lack of chlorine to treat it. Voi town and its environs have been affected by the interruption after the board shutdown the Mzima water pipeline which also supplies Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties. But the board’s Chief Executive Officer Jacob Torrut termed the interruption as minor. He said water service providers from the counties had not paid their bills leading to the shortage of the essential chemical. “We aren’t allowed to supply untreated water. We better shut down a plant than risk by supplying raw water,” he said. He said they have already procured the chemical and assured residents that water supply will be restored by the end of Wednesday. SUPPLY TO RESUME “Normal water supply will resume shortly. My people on the ground have already informed me that they have received the chemical,” he said. He said the board has the obligation of ensuring that the water they are supplying is fit for human consumption. Mr Torrut said the other Coast counties were not affected as they have other water sources which include Tiwi boreholes, Baricho Waterworks and Marere springs. Taita Taveta’s water company, Tavevo, owes the board an accumulated debt of Sh411 million. Water Executive Gasper Kabaka said the county government had already written to the National Treasury seeking a waiver of the debt. He said they have convened a meeting with the board to work out how to settle their monthly bills. “We want to sit and agree on how we will be paying our monthly rates,” he said.
