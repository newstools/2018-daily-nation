The threat by teachers to go on strike in protest against performance appraisals and contracting should be nipped in the bud before learning is thrown into disarray, at great cost to the students, yet again. The Kenya National Union of Teachers says that while it is not opposed, in principle, to the policy introduced by the Teachers Service Commission in 2016, its implementation has been haphazard and time-consuming. The Knut wants teachers involved in the creation of the tools measuring performance. However, the policy is at the heart of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) signed between the TSC and the unions in 2016. ENGAGE UNIONS Because teachers’ strikes are usually long-drawn-out, resulting in huge disruptions in the academic calendar, to the detriment of millions of young people, it is difficult to understand why the public education system should be thrown into a mess over an issue that can be debated and quickly sorted out. The TSC needs to engage the unions so that they buy into and own the system rather than forcing it down their throats. If the teachers hold on to the perception that the policy implementation is oppressive and intimidating, it is bound to fail. Performance appraisals are the standard method for gauging employee output and are the basis for promotions, demotions and transfers across the public and private sector. CONFIDENCE But they work best when carried out in a fair, friendly and simple manner. Rather than taking an iron-fisted approach, the TSC should sit down with the teachers and debate the contentious points with an open and objective mind. It should first examine the issues raised by the unions with a view to coming up with options that will inspire confidence in the system. The unions must also cease their boycott threats and engage in what they know best — negotiations.
