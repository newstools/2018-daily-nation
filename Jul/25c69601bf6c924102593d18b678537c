AFC Leopards were left to rue an error in judgement by match referee George Mwai after picking up a single point in Saturday's SportPesa Premier League clash against Bandari at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos that ended goalless. In other results, Thika United battled to a one-all draw against Kakamega Homeboyz at the Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega. Thika coach John Njogu was sent off in the match. And Tusker were thrashed 5-2 by Kariobangi Sharks in a surprise result at the Camp Toyoyo grounds while Mathare United rallied from behind to secure a thrilling 3-3 draw against basement side Wazito in Machakos.   In Machakos, the highlight of the clash featuring the 'Big Cats' against the coastal side arrived midway through the opening half when Mwai awarded Leopards a penalty.   But then, the centre referee and his assistants failed to spot the final destination of new signing Alex Oromotal spot kick, which was past the goal line. TV replays showed the ball bouncing off the bar and rebounding inside the whitewash before getting back into play in what should have been a clear goal. Nevertheless, Leopardsâ€™ Argentine coach Rodolfo Zapata elected to take a diplomatic approach when asked about the incident after the final whistle. "They are a very tricky team," he said. "We tried different things, change of tactics, different formations and style of play but failed to penetrate them." In Kakamega, Thika stunned the hosts with a 13th minute goal from roving midfielder James Kinyanjui. Homeboyz equalised in the second half via Benjamin Oketch 11 minutes after the restart. "I expected a much different game to what I saw today. Our attack completely lost direction compared to the opposition," Homeboyz coach Paul Nkata moaned. Elsewhere, Derrick Onyango - who joined Wazito from the Slum Boys during the mid-season transfer window - scored a brace in his team's 3-3 draw against an out of form Mathare.
