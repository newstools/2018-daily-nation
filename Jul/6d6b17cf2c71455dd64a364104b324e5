The Advocates Complaints Commission has struck six rogue lawyers off its roll over professional misconduct such as issuing bad cheques and withholding clients’ funds. In its 110th quarterly report signed by the commission’s chairman Beauttah Siganga, the commission’s disciplinary tribunal suspended eight other lawyers and admonished two. The report covering April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 showed the commission received 215 complaints against lawyers practicing in various parts of the country. “Complaints pending as at April 1, 2018 were 4,688. Closed files during the period under review are 326. Still pending as at June 30, 2018 are 4,577 complaints,” said Mr Siganga. COMPLAINTS Six lawyers were accused of failure to account for the cases they were handling, six for failure to render professional services and eight for withholding funds. Two other lawyers faced charges of issuing dishonoured cheques, overcharging and withholding documents. The matters referred to the disciplinary tribunal in accordance with section 60 (1) of the Advocates Act were five. The tribunal referred three complaints to court, where one was withdrawn and two were dismissed. Five complaints were rejected, four closed since no misconduct was disclosed, one settled and five abandoned.   Judges say it is wrong not to pay loan because the advocate who drew the document lacked practising certificate
