Many Kenyans, possibly thousands, have asked the taxman for more time to file their annual tax returns. By the Saturday, June 30 deadline, many people were complaining that they were unable to file their tax returns on time because of a Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) 'system failure.' They have urged the taxman to give them more time to avoid the Sh20,000 penalty. But by close of business Saturday, the extension had not been granted. In a tweet, KRA reminded Kenyans that June 30 was the deadline for them to file their tax returns. “It’s D-Day!! Have you filed your tax returns? Failure to file by today means a 20K penalty,” the tweet said. KRA said its contact and service centres were open on Saturday as thousands thronged their offices in last-minute rush. The taxman noted an increase in number of residents filing their returns compared to last year. In Mombasa, KRA boss Ronald Omulindi said over 3.4 million people had filed their returns by Saturday afternoon. Those who have been unable to file urged KRA for an extension.   Requirement for taxpayers to file annual income returns is founded on major reasons.
