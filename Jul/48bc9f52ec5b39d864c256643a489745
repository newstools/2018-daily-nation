The Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) has threatened to call for a nationwide strike over the new tax measures proposed in the Finance Bill, 2018. First Assistant Secretary-General Ernest Nadome on Thursday said Cotu has launched a series of meetings to plan for the strike. Addressing journalists at Travellers Beach Resort in Mombasa, Mr Nadome said they have asked the government to review the bill. "We sent out a letter yesterday seeking audience with the respective government officials failing which we are going to mobilise people and bring this country to a standstill. "We cannot allow the government to raid the pockets of ordinary Kenyan’s without any order," Mr Nadome said. REVENUEMr Nadome said Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich made the proposals without public participation. "The CS (Mr Rotich) goes ahead with taxes that are going to overburden ordinary Kenyans and for us as Cotu representatives this is not acceptable. "We are aware that such measures have been informed by the intention of increasing the government’s revenue base," Mr Nadome said. He said the government is applying a wrong strategy to increase its revenue. The unionist said if taxes are raised then workers' collective bargaining agreements should be renegotiated. OMTATAH SUIT Accompanied by his deputy Benson Okwaro and Chairman Rajab Omondi, they endorsed activist Okiya Omtatah's lawsuit seeking to block the implementation of the scheme. Mr Omtatah has sued Mr Rotich, the Commissioner General Kenya Revenue Authority, the National Assembly and the Attorney-General. The tax proposals are aimed at beefing up revenue for the Sh3 trillion budget.   Omtatah wants Parliament to first approve the plan.
