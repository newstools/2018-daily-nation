A businessman was on Monday charged before a Nakuru court with conspiracy to defraud Baringo Senator Gideon Moi a piece of land worth Sh100 million. Mr Albert Kipkosgei Lessonet, who appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Liz Gichiha, was charged that on September 12, 1989 jointly with others not before court, conspired to defraud Senator Moi of his 1.3-acre parcel of land in Nakuru. The suspects are said to have purported to have genuine land documents issued by Mr Joseph Mulinge, a land official at the Nakuru land registry. Mr Lessonet was also charged with registering the land and transferring it to himself. Mr Kipkosgei faced two more counts of forging land documents, an offence he committed on unknown dates and place, purporting to be genuine documents issued by the lands office. But he denied all charges levelled against him and was freed on Sh800,000 cash bail or Sh5 million bond.The case will be heard on July 31.
