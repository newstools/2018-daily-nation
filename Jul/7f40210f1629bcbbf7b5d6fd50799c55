Police in Makueni have netted 19 bags of bhang estimated to be worth Sh5 million and arrested two men. The bhang was being ferried in two vehicles which were impounded and taken to Sultan Hamud Police Station. Makueni County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim said the bhang is suspected to have entered the country from Tanzania and was being taken to Mombasa. The two suspects will be charged in court on Thursday, said Mr Maalim. On Tuesday, police arrested three drug peddlers in a sting operation in Wote Town, Makueni County. At least 511 rolls of bhang and 500 stones of the narcotic were recovered from the suspects. Makueni Police Commander Moses ole Napeiyan said that the three would be arraigned in court.
