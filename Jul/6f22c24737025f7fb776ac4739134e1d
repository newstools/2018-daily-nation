SAINT PETERSBURG France boss Didier Deschamps and Belgium coach Roberto Martinez both made just one change for Tuesday's blockbuster World Cup semi-final between the neighbouring European nations in Saint Petersburg. Juventus midfielder Blaise Matuidi returned from suspension for France in place of Corentin Tolisso as Deschamps named the same side that beat Argentina 4-3 in the last 16. Martinez's change was a forced one, with right wing-back Thomas Meunier suspended and could prompt a change in formation. Tottenham's Mousa Dembele, a central midfielder by trade, comes in and could deputise on the flank or see Kevin De Bruyne pushed wide in an attacking set-up from Martinez.
