Three armed robbers raided a church in Nyeri Town on Tuesday and made away with more than Sh1 million. The men wielding guns stormed the office of African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa (AIPCA) at around 3pm. The robbers, who arrived on a motorcycle, reportedly shot in the air and demanded money. Bishop Bernard Muthoga said only two staff members were in the office at the time of the robbery. The workers were unhurt in the incident. Nyeri Central Assistant County Commissioner John Marete told the Nation that police were pursing the suspects.
