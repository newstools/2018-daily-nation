The Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) will inject Sh300 million to rehabilitate roads damaged by floods in Tana River, the county director Henry Indeche has said. Speaking at a National Government Service Delivery Coordination Committee meeting in Tana River Thursady, Mr Indeche said almost 70 per cent of the rural road network was damaged by the floods that hit the county early this year. Some places are still flooded. Among the affected roads is the Boji-Masalani bridge which connects Tana River and Garissa County, which he said is still flooded. “The estimated cost of repair of the road network under KeRRA to motorable standards after the rains stop is approximately Sh300 million,” he told the committee chaired by County Commissioner Oning’oi ole Sosio. He also told the committee that the authority spent about Sh147.9 million to rehabilitate roads in the county in the last financial year. He said KeRRA also spent Sh88.2 million to maintain and improve 1,021.5 kilometres of roads across the county using the Road Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF), adding that each of county’s constituencies received Sh29.4 million. Tana River County has 90 kilometres of Class A roads, 300km of Class B roads while Classes C, D and E roads account for a total of 700.6 kilometres, with 692 kilometres being unclassified.
