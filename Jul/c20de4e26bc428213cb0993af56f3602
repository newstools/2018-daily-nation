Twenty-two guns have been surrendered by locals in Trans Mara Sub-County as police intensify a crackdown. Narok County Commissioner George Natembeya said a joint security team received the guns following a government amnesty. “The operation will go on for 30 days,” Mr Natembeya said in his office as he displayed the firearms and 16 rounds of ammunition. The operation was launched after the killing of a Kenya Wildlife Service ranger as he was watching a World Cup match in a bar last week. The volatile area has known no peace for the last two years due to a conflict pitting members of two neighbouring communities. Mr Natembeya said the weapons were being used in the protracted conflict that has left more than 10 people dead in the volatile Trans-Mara West and East border. “A number of people have been killed, and others injured for years and people are using these illegal weapons,” said Mr Natembeya. Mr Natembeya urged his counterpart in Migori to conduct a similar mop-up.
