Kajiado County government has launched a digital bursary disbursement system to be used in the payment of the funds to schools in the county from third term. The county’s Education and Vocational Training minister Seki Lenku said beneficiaries will no longer need to present their applications physically but rather submit them online. “Plans are at an advanced stage to kick start disbursement of bursaries through electronic funds transfers that will cut down on cases of bad cheques being issued to schools,” said Mr Lenku. Once the selection committee completes their vetting process, the transfer of bursary funds will be done directly from the system to school bank accounts. Mr Lenku said training on the new management system has kicked off earnestly for staff in the department of education and will then be cascaded to sub-County and Ward administrators then to MCAs who are in the bursary and education committee in the coming weeks. Mr Seki said county has set aside Sh40 million for disbursement to needy students at the beginning of the next school term.
