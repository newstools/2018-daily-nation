Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has suffered a blow after a court stopped the planned eviction of junior staff from county-owned houses. The staff were to be evicted so that senior county officials can move in. Justice Lucy Waithaka of the Lands and Environment Court in Nyeri barred the county government from evicting the 19 junior staff from the houses in Kenyatta, Machakos and Ngei estates in Nanyuki town. The judge revoked letters issued by the government ordering the staff to vacate the houses to pave way for renovations before they are given out to the senior staff, who include advisors. The notice came after the county assemblyâ€™s committee on finance and planning recommended renovation of the houses. The committee chaired by Joseph Kiguru also directed the devolved unit to conduct an audit to determine whether its houses in Nanyuki, Nyahururu and Rumuruti are occupied by county government employees.
