Embu Governor Martin Wambora has asked health officials to ensure a local nurse is available whenever the three Cuban doctors posted to the county are examining a patient so as to ease communication. He said the county will also use the language barrier to the county’s advantage, by enabling local doctors tap knowledge while serving as interpreters. The county received a nephrologist, a neurologist and a family medicine practitioner who will be stationed at the Embu Level Five Hospital. The family doctor will also move to other level four hospitals and will be using the Beyond Zero mobile clinic. “Cuba will help us move one step forward towards universal health. You can attach a doctor who is keen about family medicine so as they can learn and translate the local language. You can also have a nurse nearby the assist in translation,” said Mr Wambora when he officially received the doctors. The doctors said they have learnt some basic Swahili and expressed optimism that they would learn the local dialect through interaction with local health workers and patients. The doctors will also have fully furnished houses and will take special consideration to Ms Lyannys Fontaine Pacheco whose spouse will be working in the neighbouring Tharaka-Nithi County. Mr Wambora also instructed the relevant departments to arrange for the three to tour the various tourist attractions in the county.
