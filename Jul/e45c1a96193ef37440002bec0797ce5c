Two Jubilee MPs have hit out at National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale for opposing President Uhuru Kenyatta’s nomination of former Salaries and Remuneration Commission chairperson Sarah Serem for an ambassadorial position. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and his Mathira counterpart Rigathi Gachagua, while speaking at Bishop Gatimu Ngandu Girls School during a funds drive on Friday, criticized Mr Duale for urging lawmakers to shoot the nomination down. Mr Duale, while addressing the National Assembly on Thursday, asked members of the National Security, Defence and Foreign Relations Committee to reject Ms Serem’s nomination for slashing their salaries and allowances in the 11th parliament. The Garissa Township MP said the vetting exercise would be a good opportunity for MPs to get back at Ms Serem, who has been nominated to be Kenya’s ambassador to China. However, Mr Kuria vowed to mobilise his colleagues to defy Mr Duale and ensure Ms Serem’s nomination goes through. “She is a nominee of the President. We will approve her name. The Majority Leader is wrong on this one and I will mobilise other members of Parliament to pass the nomination,” he said. Mr Gachagua said: "MPs’ work is to process and approve the President’s nomination. We are telling Ms Serem not to be intimidated by Mr Duale’s sentiments. The President was right when nominating her and we will pass the recommendation."
