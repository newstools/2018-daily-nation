Three suspected kidnappers have been killed by detectives in Gathuku village, Murang'a County. County Police Commander Mohammed Farah on Thursday said the three had kidnapped a woman and demanded Sh5 million ransom. "After knowing they have been cornered, they opened fire leading to a shoot out but they were overpowered," he said. Ms Margaret Waithira was kidnapped on July 13 and was being held at one of the suspect's home. The suspects were two middle-aged men and an 80-year-old woman. DRUGGED Ms Waithira said she was kidnapped at Kiria village while on her way home after dropping her brother in Nyeri County. She said the two men blocked her car and when she got out in protest they assaulted her. "After coming out of my vehicle they roughed me up and slapped me asking whether I had some money. "But when I told them I had some money in the bank, they gave me water from a bottle and I fainted thereafter," she said. "That day was the worst day of my life." Mr Farah said that an AK 47, a home-made pistol and four rounds of ammunition were seized.
