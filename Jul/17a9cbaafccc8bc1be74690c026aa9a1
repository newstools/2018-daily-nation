The informal ‘boda boda’ transport sub-sector is a growing national problem that needs to be seriously addressed. While it’s generally acknowledged that the motorcycle taxis complement public transport, especially in the rural areas, they have also become increasingly visible in the towns and other urban centres. However, the biggest problem with boda boda is the riders’ penchant for lawlessness. They break traffic rules with impunity and have, therefore, tremendously increased the burden of traffic police officers. PROBLEMS What started out as a peripheral operation, mainly using bicycles, has gained ground with the faster and more efficient motorbikes, spawning problems that call for some kind of regulation. Rogue riders now contribute significantly to the increasing fatal road accidents in collisions with motor vehicles. Many have also been injured in crashes due to speeding or sheer recklessness. And this has a lot to do with the lack of proper instruction for the riders. It’s not uncommon for people to buy these machines and give them to their kin, who, after only a few lessons by unqualified instructors, will be on the road carrying passengers. ACCIDENTS Today, many public and even private hospitals report that the majority of the accident victims in their wards are from boda boda crashes. This puts undue pressure on the limited medical facilities. This is why this necessary evil needs to be tamed. The proposals by MPs to the Transport ministry to guide boda boda operations are a step in the right direction. For starters, the National Assembly Transport Committee wants all the riders to be registered in saccos to ease their regulation. The registration of boda boda is long overdue. It will help to curb their recruitment into criminal gangs as they will be easily identifiable and also to professionalise their operations.
