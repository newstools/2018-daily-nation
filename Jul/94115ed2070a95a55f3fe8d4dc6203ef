Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has said that their recent meeting with Deputy President William Ruto was aimed at seeking more development for Kitui County from the national government The MP refuted claims that Kitui legislators met Mr Ruto last week to seek a way of aligning themselves with him ahead of the 2022 elections. On Monday last week, all elected MPs from Kitui including Woman Rep Irene Kasalu and Senator Enock Wambua visited the DP at his Nairobi office where a myriad of issues are said to have been discussed. Among them were ways in which the county can fully benefit from development from the government. SUPPORT KALONZO Speaking at Musila Gardens while issuing development cheques worth Sh22 million to all 180 schools in the constituency, Dr Mulyungi said that the only other reason of meeting with DP Ruto was to seek his support for Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. “As we all might have seen, there is a clear indication that Jubilee is in the brink of a major falling-out. Our aim as Wiper is to capitalise on [it] by seeking support from either side which would be willing to work with us,” said Dr Mulyungi. The vocal Wiper legislator refuted claims that Kitui MPs may have shifted their loyalty from Mr Musyoka, who is perceived to be the Ukambani kingpin, to DP Ruto. “Nobody can buy our allegiance; we are in Wiper to stay and the only thing that can happen is people from other parties joining us and not vice versa,” added Dr Mulyungi. PRESIDENCY He said their only goal is to see Mr Musyoka ascend to the presidency come 2022. Dr Mulyungi added that Wiper is determined to clinch the top seat in future elections, hence they must be ready to work with all like-minded legislators from across political divides in order to improve their chances of winning elections. “We are open to any side in case of a split within Jubilee. Our main objective is boosting our political base in order to improve our chances of being in power come 2022,” he said.
