Five students from Chulaimbo Secondary School were on Monday charged with arson at the Maseno Law Courts. The students denied the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Sang Kipngeno who released them on a cash bail of Sh30,000 or Sh100,000 bond each. The five are suspected to be behind a fire that gutted two dormitories on Saturday. About 200 students were affected in the fire incident and spent the night in classrooms and dining hall. No casualties were reported since the fire broke out at 9pm while students were in class for their evening preps. According to Chulaimbo boarding master Maurice Okuku everything was fine until about 9pm when there was a loud bang at a prefectsâ€™ cube in Owira dormitory. It caught fire immediately which then spread to another dormitory. Almost everything was destroyed in the fire. The students allegedly chased away firefighters who responded, accusing them of taking too long to arrive at the school. The matter will be mentioned on July 23 and heard on August 21.   Six schools in Nyanza region have been shut this week over student unrest.
