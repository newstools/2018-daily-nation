Evil lurks out there most of the time and the most vulnerable potential victims are children. This is why there are elaborate laws to protect children so that they can grow up in peace and develop their potential into useful adult citizens. There are reports of children being lured into criminal gangs or introduced to substance abuse, however, literally stealing their youth as they are denied an opportunity to play and grow like others. Reports of girls as young as 12 being lured into prostitution at the coast are disturbing, but hardly surprising. The exploitation of girls and boys aged between 12 and 17, who work as curio sellers on the beaches or as tour guides, is not new. CHILD LABOURThere have been numerous reports about the dangers to which these children are exposed daily. After dropping out of school and getting involved in child labour, their future is uncertain. However, prostitution particularly exposes them to grave danger — including sexually transmitted diseases and the possibility of contracting HIV. Poverty has been cited as a major force driving children into this mess. This is where parents come in. They have a responsibility to provide for the children they bring forth and yet some of them contribute to this. SELL ITEMS It’s common knowledge that some parents send their children to the beaches and the streets to sell items and earn a living. What many do not realise is that they are exposing the young ones to deadly environments that they hardly have the skills and experience to manoeuvre. While the measures the hotel industry has taken to fight child prostitution are commendable, a lot more needs to be done. These children should be in school and not out there on the beach chasing after tourists. Surveillance and patrols by security personnel should be stepped up to rescue children from this exploitation.
