Huawei Mobile has launched Huawei Y5 Prime 2018 in Kenya as they seek to control the lucrative smartphone market in the region. The Y5 Prime, like the Y7 Prime 2018, has a sizeable LCD screen. The mobile phone has a 3020mAh battery, three-card-slot, Android 8.1 and gives consumer best experience in an entry-level smartphone. Nation Tech reviewed this device and found that its specs were quite commendable for a phone in that price range. Here’s our experience. It has a 5.45” display with a high definition (HD) resolution. It supports split screen as well the latest three-finger screenshot ability, allowing one to take a screen shot easily.   On the battery front, its 3020mAh will give you greater endurance. It can play continuous music for 62 hours non-stop and you can watch 13 hours of video. It also has the Power Saving 6.0 technology to save the juice when it starts running low. The phone has an internal memory of 16GB, which might be too small for those who love to save images and videos on their phones. However, it has a micro SD slot that can expand the internal memory to up to 256GB. Its dual SIM slot will also come in handy when one wants to use one phone for their two SIMs.   On the flip side, it’s camera specs weren’t the best as it comes with a 5MP front camera and a 13MP rear camera. Though the images were quite good, they were not sharper than those of higher models. For its price of Sh9,999, you can’t really complain about the quality of the phone. Huawei Y5 is an awesome device packed with the mid-range features and other powerful features in a reasonable price range. The Huawei Y5 is brilliant for medium usage and you should consider this device as an ideal entry level smartphone.   It allows users to watch and share longer videos up to an hour long.
