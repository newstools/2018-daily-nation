Kenyan juniors are out to conquer all when the World Under-20 Championships in athletics get underway on Tuesday in Tampere, Finland, as Team Kenya for the Africa Senior Championships proceeds to residential training at Kasarani, Nairobi, ahead of the continental competition from August 1-5 in Asaba, Nigeria. We wish the juniors well, hoping that this time round they will top the medal standing, having finished second to USA in the three editions held. Kenya has once topped the medal table in the event in 2000, 2006 and 2010, flooring giants USA and Jamaica. This can be done again following the competitive trials and quality training. WORLD BEATERS The team is mainly composed of world beaters in last year’s World Under-18 Championships in Nairobi, which makes them eligible for the 2020 U-20 event that Kenya is bidding to host. Athletics Kenya must move fast to ensure that the athletes are well-guided and protected, considering that most of them will be in contention for medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Team Kenya for the continental championship should also take training seriously since the event is a precursor to the 2018 World Championships planned for Doha, Qatar. CLUB GAMES Notably, most of our elite athletes who missed the Commonwealth Games trials have made the team, hence a good show is expected in Asaba to atone for the flop at the “Club Games”. AK and the government should liaise to ensure that athletes have ample and productive time in camp. It’s good to note that competition will be stiff since Kenya’s main rivals in the middle- and long distances races Ethiopia, Algeria, Morocco, South Africa and Botswana, among others, will be in Asaba, where Africa will pick its team for IAAF Continental Cup slated for September 8-9 in Ostrava, Czech Republic.
