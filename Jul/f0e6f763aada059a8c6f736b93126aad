Lettfot (Kalvin Nganga), locked on to her fourth straight win by shelving the Nairobi Town Plate, asserting a powerful resonance of authority over Piece of Cake and Tainted Love. Trained by Stewart McCann, who also rubber-stamped the Jardin Lafitte Cup with Flash Harry, it was indicative of never giving up. Imagine Flash Harry suddenly pronouncing a flair for distance, dangling regular rival, As Paragon, to second place. The prestigious Sir Ali Bin Salim Stakes for two-year-olds, went off at high-octane speed, with Silverstone sliding unabridged from favourite, Fast Five. Customary Seasonal Awards, were handed out after racing, navigated almost entirely by Madamoiselle Patsy Sercombe, plus her entourage of Lesley Sercombe, Richard Kibet, Mrs Michael Spencer, and, Free-Wheeler - who naturally knitted a warm blanket for the George Drew Challenge Series. More legitimate fodder on medallists, will be published later this week. NGONG RESULTS 12.10 pm - First Race - Tawleed Maiden (1,200m) 1. Vipingo (Richard Kibet) 2. Choc Chip (Lesley Sercombe) 3.
