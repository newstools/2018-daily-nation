Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong' and his three Cabinet members facing graft charges were on Friday released by a Nairobi court on Sh1 million bail each. The court ruled that there is no evidence that the four suspects will interfere with the course of justice or make witnesses not to testify. Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti also issued warrants of arrested against five other suspects who are yet to appear in court. Mr Ojaamong was charged on Wednesday together with county executive officer, Mr Bernard Yaite, Mr Allan Ekweny, the chief officer Finance and Mr Samuel Ombui, the Head of Treasury. They denied charges of conspiracy to commit an economic crime, abuse of office and engaging in a project without proper planning. The deal was entered in 2014 for a feasibility study on solid waste management. The prosecution opposed their release on bail arguing that they might interfere with witnesses because they were influential persons in the county. The court heard that most of the witnesses were junior officers from the county and the accused persons might intimidate or dissuade them from testifying. The prosecution had also failed to disclose their identity.
