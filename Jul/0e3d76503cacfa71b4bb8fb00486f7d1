Consumers will from Wednesday start paying new power tariffs, devoid of a fixed charge of Sh150 per month, after the energy regulator made the changes. The new rates have pushed up power costs for middle class users while favouring poor homes and top consumers. The tariff review by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) sought to remove billing fluctuations, especially for customers on prepaid meters by creating uniform prices. The majority of prepaid customers have been experiencing wild fluctuations during the purchase of electricity tokens at different times of the month, denying them the ability to predict their costs and budget properly.
