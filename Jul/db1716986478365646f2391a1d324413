I recently found out that my boyfriend is cheating with my best friend. I don’t know how to handle this. I don’t know how I should confront them.  If you have sufficient proof, i.e. texts, screenshots, undeniable information – well, for one, take as many clothes from her closet as you can back. I assume that since the two of you are best friends, you probably share many things – if not clothes, accessories such as bags, hair ties, etc. Get them back now, because now that your friendship is over, you probably won't have a chance to get them back again. And yes – your friendship, and your relationship, are both over – they were over the moment those two eyed each other, crossed the line into infidelity and betrayal against the agreed codes of conduct of your relationship and basically stabbed you in the back. As they wielded the knife together, they deserve each other. If you're feeling particularly vengeful, pour something permanent on his clothes, like ink. If you're feeling less vengeful, after you clear your stuff out, block them completely and go on vacation. Even if it is to your auntie's down the road who won't ask you too many questions. You deserve some time to heal and pray that such people never cross your path again. To confront them? You don't have to. Closure is overrated. Let them know you know, if you must, and then cut them off like gangrene. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
