Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority (Ufaa) says it is processing 5,018 claims for payments of Sh281 million year-to-date. Chief executive Kellen Kariuki hailed the rising claims as the authority prepares to mount campaigns to inform the public of the available money, securities, unit trusts, matured insurance policies and other assets in their custody standing at Sh36.5 billion. “Processing of claims is a work-in-progress where due diligence is observed to ensure the right claimants are paid. The National Registration Bureau, Ministry of Land and the Judiciary have been incorporated to authenticate documents submitted to us,” she said. The authority has listed the assets held in trust including cash (Sh10.7 billion), 446.99 shares worth Sh25.76 billion and 8.15 million unit trusts worth Sh14.55 million on www.ufaa.go.ke. Uncollected workers’ salaries and benefits, pensions, unit trusts, matured policies, unclaimed dividends, money in dormant bank and sacco accounts as well as mobile money wallets that remain uncollected for more than two years are deemed unclaimed and must be surrendered to the Ufaa.

The Ufaa said contents of the safe-boxes are unknown but recent burglaries indicate they hold valuables worth millions of shillings. The agency and the safe-box custodians are yet to come up with guidelines to open the safe boxes and disclose contents that will be sold.
