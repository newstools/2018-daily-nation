My sex life is boring. I want to try experiment in bed but I am scared. Sometimes I feel guilty even thinking about it. I was brought up in a deeply religious setting and I don’t know how my husband will take it.  Ok, you're married and still not having great, legal sex? Sigh. I'm so sorry. Listen, you can bring up the subject slowly (all puns intended) but you really still must bring it up. I'm assuming you mentioned your religious background to indicate that you are still mostly religious and thus are planning to stay in this marriage forever, till death do you part. Are you telling me that you're willing to have uninspiring, uninventive sex for the next 50 years? Really? Come on. You didn't get married in church for this. You can start small (bites as opposed to choking). You might be surprised that your husband also wants to switch it up but doesn't know how you will take it. Please save your sex life. Life is too short and marriage is too long for bad sex. John 10:10 says that Jesus came so that we might have life, and have it more abundantly. This means all aspects of life, including within the sanctity of marriage and the marital bed. I leave you with this wonderful verse from Proverbs (not Song of Solomon, I too was surprised): Proverbs 5:18-19 “Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.” *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
