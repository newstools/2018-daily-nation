A 34-year-old man who stole two cooking pots (sufurias) valued at Sh2,400 from a hawker in Nanyuki town will spend four-and-a-half years in prison. Francis Mugambi Kibiki suffered a blow after the High Court threw out his appeal and ruled that the sentence passed by a magistrate’s court on September 17, 2017 was not harsh or excessive. He stole the items from Mary Akinyi who earned her living by selling boiled eggs in Nanyuki town on June 22, 2015. Ms Akinyi left her home to hawk those eggs, the court heard, and as she walked away she saw Mr Kibiki outside the gate. Later, Joseph Lolo, whom the complainant owed Sh50 for chicken gizzard supplied to her, went to complainant’s house to collect the debt. WITNESS He met Mr Kibiki walking out of the Ms Akinyi’s front door carrying a bag and in it was what looked like sufurias, Mr Lolo told the court. The witness testified that Ms Akinyi’s door had been broken. Mr Kibiki was subsequently seen by the complainant, within Nanyuki town, but on noticing her he ran away. He was later arrested and charged with offence of house breaking and stealing. While dismissing the appeal, the High Court noted that what was stolen by the appellant could be of little value but it meant a lot to the complainant, whom the court noted was from a humble background.
