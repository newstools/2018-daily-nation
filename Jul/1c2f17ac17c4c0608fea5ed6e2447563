The government has acknowledged homosexuality is a deep rooted problem in boarding schools. According to Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang, homosexuality is a real social and moral issue that needs concerted efforts by all, especially parents to curb it. "But the buck stops is with us as parents. How have we brought up our children?‚Äù the PS said. To deal with the vice, Dr Kipsang said the government has heavily invested in guidance and counselling, especially in secondary schools where incidents have been reported. In an exclusive interview with the Nation in Mombasa, the PS asked teachers to help weed out the vice. "Our teachers are capable of noticing some of these cases since they are closer to the students. Teachers should identify behaviour changes but it is a problem that is societal and we all have to address it," said the PS. Dr Kipsang said some of the cases don't start in schools but from homes. The PS asked the faith-based institutions, communities, parents and the media to help in addressing the behaviour. "It is not anything that Kenyans can put it on the teachers. It is something that as society we need to address it," added the official. During 43rd annual head teachers' conference in Mombasa, the principals acknowledged existence of homosexuality in schools.
