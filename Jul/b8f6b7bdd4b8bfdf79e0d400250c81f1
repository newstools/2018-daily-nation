Turkana County Commissioner Seif Matata has assured Tullow Oil the government will provide ample security for safe transportation of oil to Mombasa after the Kalemngorok incident. The administrator accused local leaders and residents of political blackmail for demanding return of stolen cattle, jobs and tenders as preconditions to allow transportation of crude oil. Speaking in his office in Lodwar, Mr Matata said Turkana County has enjoyed relative peace in the last year and security incidents have been resolved in partnership with local leaders. The county commissioner said blocking of oil trucks at Kalemngorok on Wednesday was unnecessary. Turkana South MP James Lomenen and his Turkana East counterpart Ali Mohamed Lokiru have agreed to meet with Interior Cabinet Secretary (CS) Fred Matiang’i to discuss how to end the row. But the MPs have vowed they won’t relent in their push for security, jobs and contracts, warning Mr Matiang’i against any attempts to intimidate them. Mr Lomenen said Mr Matiang'i seemed more focused on addressing contraband sugar than dealing with security threats in the region.   Protesting residents forced their way into Ngamia 8 oil site on Friday after overpowering security guards.
