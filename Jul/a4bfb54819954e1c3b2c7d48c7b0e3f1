Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) put up a convincing performance to down Kangemi AllStars 2-1 in a National Super League (NSL) match at Camp Toyoyo grounds on Saturday. Rookie midfielder Martin Nderitu put the bankers ahead in the 24th minute before former Oserian and AFC Leopards forward Simon Abuko doubled their lead 20 minutes to time. A comical mistake from KCB goalkeeper Zamu Adisa allowed Ivan Wava to bring back Kangemi in the game, setting up a nervy end to encounter. The bankers went level on points with third-placed Nairobi Stima on 43, though the latter, held 2-2 by Talanta in an early kick-off at Camp Toyoyo, sit third on the log thanks to a superior goal difference. Ushuru top the standings on 48 points following their 2-0 win over City Stars on Friday. “I am happy with the result, we are moving in the right direction, one that will see us hit our target of returning to the top flight,” said KCB coach John Kamau after the game. At Moi stadium in Kisumu, Kevin Monyi’s strike in the third minute saw Western Stima, under new man Paul Ogai, edge Kibera Black Stars 1-0 to move to second place on 46 points. Elsewhere, Green Commandoes were a no show in Mombasa on Friday, gifting Modern Coast Rangers three points and a 2-0 score line. The schoolboys failed to travel as they were participating in the National Secondary School Term Two Games in Eldoret where they nailed their 13th title beating Olbolsat 1-0 in the final on Saturday.
