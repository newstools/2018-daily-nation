A dormitory at Kisii High School was on Tuesday night destroyed by fire. Parents and members of the public flocked the national boys' school after getting news that the institution was on fire. The dormitory is near the Kisii-Keroka Highway. Mr James Moracha, a parent to a Form Three student, said he rushed to the school to find out whether the students were safe. “I am glad that all students are well. Teachers have confirmed to us,” he said. He called upon perpetrators of the fires in various schools in the country to stop, saying the incidents were a threat to education. School Board of Management Chairman Mr Patrick Nyagusia said property of unknown value was destroyed. “The dormitory, commonly referred to us ‘Wire House’, was completely destroyed. Nothing was salvaged. But we are grateful to the County Disaster Team for their quick response in fighting the fire,” he said. Kisii County Executive for Administration Mr Walter Okibo called for calm saying investigations were ongoing to determine the the cause of the fire.   Homa Bay County police boss says his officers have launched investigations to establish the cause of the fire.
