Police have arrested 11 students of Rumanthi Secondary School in Meru County after teachers foiled an attempt to burn down a dormitory. A nearby school, Luuma secondary, has also been closed after a girl’s dormitory was torched on Monday. Buuri chief John Mamira said the fire at Luuma broke out at around 5.30am as students were attending morning preps. “Investigations are ongoing to establish the cause. However, preliminary investigations show that the fire was not caused by an electric fault. Police will soon make arrests,” Mr Mamira said.
