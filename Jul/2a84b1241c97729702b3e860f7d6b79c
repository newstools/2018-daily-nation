Hi Brenda, I was in an abusive marriage for some years and had a one-night stand. I got pregnant so I had to move out of my marital home. I later lost my job and I have been making do with what I get. My baby daddy did not deny he sired my child but he has not been supporting me financially and he ignores me. I am really struggling to make ends meet and I need child support. This is quite a quandary. I am glad you moved out of your marital home, as no one should not stay in an abusive marriage. Kudos to you on that. But now you need a bigger plan than leaving and having a one-night stand. I need more information here. If the second man is not refusing his child, why is he not giving child support? Perhaps this is the point at which you engage a lawyer to demand child support – after all, you do not have to be married to get the law on your side. And yes, if you don't have money for a lawyer, sue with damages – where if you win, which you will, because it is his child after all, then he's paying for your lawyer as well. Sounds complicated? Not nearly as complicated as raising a child with no job. If you have family, you need to appeal to them as well for help as you figure your life out. Get a job. Any job. You don't have the luxury right now to be picky. If all else fails, figure out where your child's grandmother lives as a last resort and report the man-child to his mother. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
