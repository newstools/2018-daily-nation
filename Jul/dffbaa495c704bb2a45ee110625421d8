An Administration Police officer who is facing murder charges in the killing of a university student has been granted bail. Constable Leakey Maina, who was charged in High Court, Meru, denied killing Meru University student leader Evans Njoroge at Kabebe village in Tigania West of February 27. Mr Maina was released on bail on Friday, a day after he took plea. The prosecutor, Mr Patrick Namiti, opposed the suspect’s release on bail, saying he had not received the investigation report from the Independent Policing Oversight Authority(Ipoa). But a meeting between the prosecutor and investigators resolved there were no compelling reasons to deny Mr Maina bail. The court then freed the murder suspect on a Sh200,000 cash bail and Sh400,000 bond with surety of a similar amount. As a condition of his release, Mr Maina will report to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices in Imenti North once every month with effect from next month. The murder case will be mentioned on October 1, this year.   Officer remanded until July 26 to first undergo a mental health assessment.
