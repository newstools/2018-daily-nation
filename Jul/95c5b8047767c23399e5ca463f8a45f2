It is quite disappointing that some county assemblies failed to pass their budgets by the approved June 30 deadline. Considering that the 2017/2018 financial year has lapsed, it means that those county governments will have no basis on which to carry out their operations and authorise expenditure in the new financial year. Whatever the shortcomings or differences, this is inexcusable. In fact, it is an indictment of the concerned members of the county assembly. The MCAs have failed in one of their core duties. Without budgets, absolutely nothing substantive can go on. Their other key role is to debate and pass laws. As grassroots leaders, a lot is expected of the ward reps. OVERSIGHT ROLE After scrutinising and passing the budgets, the MCAs then assume the oversight role to ensure that the allocations to the various sectors are put to the use for which they were intended. The people in the affected counties will feel terribly let down by their leaders, who were expected to work within the clearly defined timeframes to deliver budgets that make a difference in their lives. It’s a big shame that some of the leaders elected to articulate and fight for their people’s interests tend to be more obsessed with pursuing personal gain. Sadly, in many of the counties, budget making is turned into a session for extortion with some shameless MCAs holding governors to ransom. VETTING PROPOSALS In one county, the MCAs reportedly demanded to be paid Sh1.5 billion to do the job for which they were elected. This is not only unacceptable; it’s also illegal and beneath the dignity of an elected leader. Granted, some governors are not blameless. But this is precisely why we have the MCAs vetting the proposals in the annual financial statements to ensure that they reflect the needs of the people. The hitches must be cleared so that the budgets are passed immediately.
