A retired judge is being sought by Interpol for extradition to Kenya over the theft of Sh152 million from a client. The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has been ordered to trace and serve Justice (Rtd) Philip Ransley, who has since relocated to the United Kingdom, with summons to appear before the lawyers’ disciplinary tribunal to answer to charges of stealing client’s money. Nairobi Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi also issued warrants of arrest against the judge following an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The warrants will be executed by the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol). EXPUNGED NAME Meanwhile, a managing partner in one of the country's oldest law firms has been exonerated from blame in the deal. Three members of the tribunal — Mr Ezekiel Wanjama, Ms Grace Okumu and Ms Gladys Wamaitha — expunged the name of Ms Virginia Wangui Shaw of Ransley McVicker & Shaw Advocates from the proceedings, saying she was not responsible for the loss of Mr John Rowland Minns' money, which had been deposited to the law firm's clients account held at the Imperial Bank in 2015. PAY THE MONEY The tribunal allowed the consent entered between Ms Shaw and Mr Minns' lawyer that Mr Ransley be pursued personally to pay the money. The judge and Mr Minns were friends for 40 years. The money was from the sale of Minns' land in Karen, Nairobi. The court directed LSK to appear before it on November 12, 2018 to explain the alternative method it will use to serve Justice Ransley with the proceedings.   Mr Ransley had received Sh277 million on behalf of his client Mr John Rowland Minns.
