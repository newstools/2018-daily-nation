National Land Commission boss Muhammad Swazuri is, literally, a man under siege. But this is hardly surprising as he presides over a sensitive docket in an area that has, over the years, been synonymous with rot. The chairman has spent a lot of time explaining and responding to allegations of graft, in some of which he has been fingered. Being the man in the hot seat, however, it does not pay to be overly defensive, considering that by now he must have all the information on every transaction that might have taken place before his arrival and also during his tenure. Where claims against him or the NLC are being investigated, it’s only fair that such inquiries are freely carried out. If he has done nothing wrong, let the truth be his defender. FIGHTING However, in the past few days, Dr Swazuri has come out fighting, alleging a plot by some unnamed people to oust him. But he is also on record as having claimed that some of the accusations against him and the NLC are a creation of the media. We do not understand what the media would stand to gain from smearing a public officer who is doing his job to the best of his knowledge and ability. SECURE PUBLIC INTEREST But the media, as the public watchdog, would be failing in their cardinal duty by ignoring any allegations as there can be no smoke without fire. The holders of public office must be driven by nothing but the need to secure the public interest and it is this that also motivates the media scrutiny. The NLC chairman must not spare any effort in cleaning up a sector that has been dogged by mega scams for too long. Targeting the messenger, however, won’t make the complaints about irregular land dealings just go away. They need to be thoroughly investigated and the sector streamlined.
