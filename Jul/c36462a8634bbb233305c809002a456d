The Union of Kenya Civil Servants wants government to provide chiefs with firearms, saying they are working under risky and insecure conditions due to the high number of guns in the hands of unauthorised persons. The union’s Nyeri region secretary Daniel Ndung’u said the chiefs and their assistants should be issued with licences to carry guns to protect themselves. He spoke while mourning death of a Nyeri chief killed in cold blood by unknown gunmen who shot him three times on the chest. KILLED Chief Peter Nyuguto Kimiti of Kamakwa Location was killed at his home in Gitathi-ini village upon return from his office in Kamakwa township. He had just parked his motorcycle in his compound and proceeded to his farm to check on workers attending to his coffee trees, his widow Ann Muthoni said. “The drivers of illegal businesses and cartels are fighting back. They are killing and harming chiefs who are working with the police. It is time the government considers training and arming the chiefs to protect themselves,” said Mr Ndung’u. Mr Ndung'u blamed Mr Kimiti’s death on the war against rising crime and illicit brews in the village, saying the administrator was a vocal campaigner against the two vices. INVESTIGATIONS Nyeri Central OCPD Muide Kioko said investigations into the murder have started with a view to bringing the culprits to book. The killers did not steal anything from the chief or his family, Mr Muide said. Mr Kimiti is the second chief to be shot dead at his home in Nyeri County. Two years ago, Chief Martin Githinji of Ichuga location in Kieni East was killed by unknown gunmen at his home one evening. Mr Githinji was shot several times in the neck and stomach and died on the spot. He had just driven into his compound at Gwa Kania village when the assailants shot him.   Security officials say they are pursuing possible leads.
