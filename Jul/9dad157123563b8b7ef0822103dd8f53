Kenya Ports Authority yesterday signed a collective bargaining agreement with the Dock Workers Union, raising the salary of the lowest paid employee to sh40,700 and the highest to Sh97,000. The agreement will benefit 5,300 workers from January next year, said the union secretary-general Simon Sang. “The lowest cadre of staff, at Job Group HG4, will earn Sh40,700, up from Sh37,710, while the highest worker, at Job Group HG1, will earn Sh97,000 from Sh88,650," said Mr Sang. "Allowances will increase by between Sh1,000 and Sh2,000 across the board." CONNECT COUNTRY According the giant union boss, the salaries increased by nine per cent for the higher grades and 14 per cent for the lower cadres “Considering these harsh economic times, the increment in the highest in government parastatals and agencies in recent years," said Mr Sang, adding that "dockers are very unique workers because they connect the country to the rest of the world". He said the remuneration of the dock workers is also protected under the International Labour Convection 137. The acting KPA managing director, Dr Daniel Manduku, termed the signing of the CBA as a major milestone which will motivate the workers. ENSURE EFFICIENCY “Transformation is a continuous process," said Dr Manduku. "Changes are gradual, but we are making great strides." When he was appointed as the acting boss in May, Dr Manduku said top on his agenda was motivation of staff in order to ensure efficiency at the port, and yesterday he said he was now looking for ways to improve production and efficiencies. “The workers have unique skills, but they need to be motivated through adequate and relevant training. For now, I am still learning the operations at the port,” added Dr Manduku.   The go-slow caused massive snarl-up on either side of the 500-metre crossing channel.
