The Kenya Commercial Bank Karen Masters Golf tournament that ended yesterday produced thrills and good scores. The event, in its second edition, attracted top-quality players after it was incorporated into the South Africa Sunshine Tour, which saw the top prize rise to Sh2.4 million. Some of the top players came from Africa’s golfing powerhouse. The partnership will improve the quality of competition, and the sport in East Africa. Already, Kenya has been given five slots in the Sunshine Tour with the five players who made the cut at the Karen event, gaining automatic entry into the South African Series. LOCAL PLAYERS It is good news that Sunshine Tour plans to have more events in Mombasa and Uganda. This should be supported and encouraged. More sponsors should come on board. The Kenya Open is set to be transformed into a main European Tour event — meaning that few Kenyan players will be invited to the tournament. That is why the Sunshine Tour events will come in handy for local professionals. Implementation of the proposal to start the Kenya Open Safari Tour should also be hastened. The Safari Tour will help to refine local players, besides keeping them busy. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION From the look of things, none of the current crop of Kenyan professionals can win the Kenya Open or a Sunshine Tour event since most are in their sunset years. That is why the Kenya Golf Union (KGU) must up its game in helping clubs to nurture players from a young age. It goes without saying that golf in Kenya is still an elitist sport. Access to clubs is still expensive. The KGU needs to come up with affirmative action to grow the game. A public golf course will be essential to give talented but less privileged Kenyans a chance to play.
