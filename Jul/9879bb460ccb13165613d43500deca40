Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji on Wednesday ordered the arrest of Patel Coffee Estates Ltd Managing Director Perry Mansukh and general manager Vinoj Kumar on charges of manslaughter. Several Water Rights Authority and National Environment Management Authority officers are also targeted over the Patel Dam tragedy that killed 47 people and left many other injured in Solai, Nakuru County. Following the May 9 tragedy, Mr Haji directed Inspector-General Joseph Boinnet to conduct through investigations to establish the cause and culpability of the tragedy that claimed lives and left a trail of destruction in the area. The DPP said investigators found that the construction of the dam was done by unqualified staff using farm equipment leading to construction and design flaws. Mr Haji said water permit was issued irregular. He further noted that there was failure by the owners, Nema and WRA to ensure environmental compliance. Nema and WRA officials that will face manslaughter charges include, Winnie Muthoni Mutisya - Water Rights Officer, WRA, Tomkin Odhiambo - Sub-Regional Manager, WRA, Jacinta Were - Assistant Technical Coordinator, Williee Were - Nema, Nakuru County Director of Environment, Lynnete Jepchirchir, Nema officer, Nakuru County, Johnson Njuguna - County Director of Water, Julius Kavita - Sub-County Administrator. The seven officials alongside Mr Kumar will also face a second count of neglect of duty charge.  More follows.   47 people died and many others were injured after the Patel Dam collapsed on May 9.
