More than 500 pupils of St Mary’s Day and Boarding Primary School in Kiharu, Murang’a County have been forced to share toilets after the boys’ pit latrines caved in last week. The pupils are now relieving themselves in the girls’ eight pit latrines, forcing the school administration to deploy one teacher to ensure the boys and girls go in turns. But boys in the upper classes are relieving themselves in nearby bushes since they do not want to share toilets with their female colleagues. “It is chaotic as pupils visit the toilets in turns to ensure at no time the boys will mix with girls. We have been forced to assign one teacher to supervise them so that they don’t mix and also because the remaining toilets are not in good state,” said the head teacher Ms Alice Kanyora. Ms Kanyora said she has notified the local national government Constituency Development Fund offices and Murang’a County government. “I hope the elected leaders will bail us out because if things continue as they are, I am afraid that the school may be closed soon,” remarked Ms Kanyora.
