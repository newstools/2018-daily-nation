Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye is expected in Nairobi on Monday to preside over the launch of a book on Kenya's last General Election at the Intercontinental Hotel. Mr Besigye will give the keynote address at the launch of the book titled: Kenya: The Failed Quest for Electoral Justice. Journalist John Onyando authored the work through a grant from the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC). The human rights group invited Mr Besigye to Kenya to preside over the launch. Other speakers at the launch will include former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga, political leaders and lawyers who handled election petitions. According to a summary provided by the author, the book examined political events around the 2017 election within a historical framework and concluded that what should have been Kenya’s freest vote turned out to be its most tainted in the multiparty era. “The elections were so flawed that their true account would be established only through an independent audit such as the one led by former South African judge Johann Kriegler into the 2007 elections,” Mr Onyando said in a statement to the media.
