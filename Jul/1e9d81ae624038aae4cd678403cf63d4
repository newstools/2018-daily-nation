Focus has remained on referee Mark Geiger who officiated Colombia’s ill-tempered round of 16 match against England on Tuesday, with world football governing body Fifa keeping the American out of the quarter-final matches which ended on Saturday. Geiger did not officiate in the Fifa World Cup quarter-final matches which ended on Saturday. The American’s name was missing in the list of referees sent to journalists here by Fifa a day before the quarter-final matches. On Tuesday, Geiger’s performance in the last 16 match between Colombia and England drew mixed reactions, with Colombia captain Radamel Falcao saying the Major League Soccer referee had been biased against Colombia in the match.   CALLS IN FAVOUR OF ENGLAND “To tell you the truth, the process leaves a lot of doubts. He only spoke English, some bias was certain. Through small decisions, he was pushing us towards our own goal,” Falcao said after Tuesday’s match. "The referee disturbed us a lot. In the 50-50 plays, he always made the calls in favour of England.”   The match, played at Spartak Stadium in Moscow, ended 4-3 on penalties in England’s favour after a 1-1 draw in normal and extra time. Harry Kane had put England 1-0 ahead through a penalty in the 57th minute but Barcelona defender Yerry Mina scored for Colombia in the fourth minute of time added on. The two teams were locked 1-1 at the end of extra time, taking the match into penalties.   Argentine football great Diego Maradona called Geiger’s performance a “monumental theft” on Colombia. However, the Argentina legend later apologised for his comments on Friday in a social media post. Earlier in the tournament, Geiger was accused by a player from Morocco of asking for the jersey of Portugal Pepe at halftime of their game against Morocco in Group ‘B’, which would constitute a severe breach of protocol. It remains to be seen whether Geiger will be assigned semi-final matches.
