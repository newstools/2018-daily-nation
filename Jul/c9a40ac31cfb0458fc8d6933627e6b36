Kenya Sevens team leaves the country tomorrow for the Rugby World Cup set for July 20-22 at the iconic AT&T Park in San Francisco, USA. This is the fifth consecutive time Kenya Sevens are taking part in the World Cup, having reached the semi-finals in 2009 Dubai and 2013 Moscow. Despite the sideshows that almost rocked the boat over unpaid allowances, expectations are high with many Kenyans hoping the team surpasses their previous success. It’s a shame the Ministry of Sports is yet to settle the team’s pending allowances with the Deputy President William Ruto directing Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa to settle them before the Sunday departure. The team needs inspiration and support to surpass their previous feat. Preparation for the event was disturbed by shenanigans that could have been avoided. Whereas the boys are upbeat and ready for the world stage such sideshows should be avoided in future. We join the country in wishing our ambassadors success and reiterate what has been said before — for the team to achieve the desired result let all stakeholders play their role. Also on the world stage is the team representing Kenya in the third edition of the Africa Youth Games scheduled for July 18-28 in Algiers, Algeria. The young boys and girls will carry our flag high and we wish them the best and encourage them to bring the best results from Algiers.
