Day one leader Merrick Bremner on Saturday fired four under par 68 in the third round at Karen Country Club, to regain his top spot going into Sunday’s final round of the 2018 KCB Karen Masters tournament. Starting the day with the second round leader Daniel van Tonder, Bremner birdied the par fives first and second holes, before dropping a shot at the fifth. That was however a temporary set back, as he managed to recover that shot at the eighth and added one more at the 10th before again dropping a shot at the notorious par four-11th were many players have dropped shots. All the same, Tonder picked up two birdies at the 15th and 18th both par fives for his 68, to take a one shot lead from Tyrone Ryan and Pieter Moolman who both closed the day on 13 under par. Bremner is likely to be in the company of Ryan into Sunday’s battle for the top prize of Sh2.4 million. Ryan shot a neat round of seven under par 65 to also wind up the day with a three rounds total of 13 under par and with a great chance of taking home the Blue Jacket which is usually awarded to the winner. It was an absolutely great day for Ryan who made four birdies on the first nine (second, third, fifth and sixth), and three coming from the back nine’s 12th, 15th and 18th. Moolman also made four birdies at the opening nine and was heading for an eight under until he dropped a shot at the 17th, having birdied the 12th, and 15th and finally at the 18th for the day’s five under par 67 same as Michael Palmer - who played a flowing bogey free five under 67 made up of birdies on the first, second, third and at the 12th and 15th. The going was not however that smooth for Tonder, who birdied five holes but dropped four shots for only one under par 71 to drop to tie for fifth place with JC Ritche on 12 under par. On the surviving five Kenyans, Simon Ngige remained on three under par in 23rd place after posting level par 72 in the round that saw him bogey the second, fifth and seventh in the first nine and one bogey at the 16th.   It was a good finish though for him as he managed to birdie the last two holes having birdied the 14th. Long-hitting Dismas Indiza however dropped to 34th after dropping shots on the 11th, 12th and 17th. “I pitched over the greens while at the 12th, I hit my three wood to the right, but I didn’t chip well," said Indiza "I really wanted to push to the middle of field going into the final round in order to make good money. I will all the same try and get a better score tomorrow," said Indiza. Of the other three Kenyans, Stefan Andersen shot one over par 73 for a total of two over while Riz Charania and Mohit Mediratta carded 75 and 78 each.
