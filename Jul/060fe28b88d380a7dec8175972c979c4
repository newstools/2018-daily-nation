The Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) has warned students involved in school unrests that they will face criminal charges. “This is to warn every student from primary school, secondary school, college and university that the DCI is archiving and profiling every criminal act and consolidating charges that may be preferred to each and every student involved in any crime,” tweeted DCI. It went on: “Let each student be informed that it will automatically be reflected on the Police Clearance Certificate (Certificate of Good Conduct) when such students will apply for one.” DCI said the crimes will be a permanent criminal mark that will bar many students from achieving their goals since employers will shun them. Government jobs usually require applicants to submit a Good Conduct certificate, also known as the Police Clearance Certificate. “The crimes include: armed and unpeaceable demos, arson, drugs, cyber bullying, assault of any degree, drunkenness or any reported crime of any kind,” tweeted the DCI. The development comes in the wake of school unrest that has seen at least 35 schools affected and property worth millions of shillings destroyed. Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said the ministry will not stand between the police and students, saying whatever they are involved in is criminal and they must face the law. “Those destroying schools will not be considered as students but criminals and the law will take its course,” said Mr Kipsang.   Six schools in Nyanza region have been shut this week over student unrest.
