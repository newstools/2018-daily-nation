Embattled former Kenya Power (KP) boss Ben Chumo has told MPs that he is worth Sh212 million. "My estimated net worth stands at about Sh212m. I can't say I am a rich man in relative terms...[but] I can support my family," said Mr Chumo Mr Chumo was speaking on Monday when he appeared before National Assembly's Finance and National Planning Committee for vetting for chairmanship of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). Just last week, Mr Chumo was charged with abuse of office, conspiracy to commit economic crimes and failure to comply with procurement laws in the purchase of faulty transformers worth Sh450 million during his tenure as KP boss. But Mr Chumo told the MPs the alleged faulty transformers were procured in 2011/12 Financial Year, long before he was appointed the chief executive. "I was appointed as the CEO in 2013. When I assumed responsibility..., we made a decision to stop payment for the transformers. However, the supplier moved to court and there was an out of court settlement," Mr Chumo said. "Again, when the money was paid to the supplier, I had already left the office...I participated in the cancellation of the irregular tender." President Uhuru Kenyatta tapped Mr Chumo for the SRC job on June 27.   Former Kenya Power CEO is expected to be vetted on Monday SRC chairman.
