Police in Bomet are hunting for two illegal wood traders who abandoned their car and fled on foot at the town centre following high-speed chase. The two suspects were reportedly ferrying cedar posts from Narok to Bomet but refused to stop when flagged down by police at Mulot police check on Thursday, prompting the dramatic chase.
