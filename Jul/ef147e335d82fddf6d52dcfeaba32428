IN DAR ES SALAAM Meddie Kagere’s 44th minute goal sent Tanzanian champions Simba into the Cecafa Kagame Cup final after seeing off Zanzibar champions Jeshi la Kujenga Uchumi (JKU) 1-0 in the semi-final at National Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday. Simba face defending champions Azam, who beat Gor Mahia 2-0 after extra time in the other semi-final at the same venue, in an all-Tanzanian final slated for Friday with Sh3 million up for grabs. The runners up gets Sh2 million. JKU play Kenyan giants Gor Mahia in the third-place playoff whose winner gets Sh1 million. Ghanaian right back Nicholas Gyan latched onto a loose ball in the middle of the park to drive forward before setting up Kagere who unleashed a ferocious shot past JKU custodian Mohammed Abrahman. Kagere, who has netted three goals in four appearances for Simba barely a week after joining the side from Gor Mahia, could have claimed a brace at the hour mark but missed the target narrowly with the goalkeeper to beat. JKU’s attempts to find the equaliser were thwarted by a vigilant Simba defence led by veteran Paschal Wawa and captain Mohamed Hussein “Tshabalala”. Simba eliminated Djibouti side AS Ports by a solitary goal in the quarter-final on Sunday while JKU knocked out Singida United 4-3 on post-match penalties after a 0-0 draw in 120 minutes.   The game was tied 0-0 after 90 minutes.
