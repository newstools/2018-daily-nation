Wiper party’s move to support President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda will help foster peace and unity, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said. In a statement on Monday, the Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader also lauded the stance taken by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to support Mr Kenyatta’s war on corruption which will start with the lifestyle audits for government officials. Mr Musyoka’s party resolved to work with the President for the realisation of the Big Four agenda which addresses food security, better healthcare and improved manufacturing and housing. "After consultations with our greater membership and party structures, we commit to work with the President in his fight against corruption as well as his broad agenda of transforming this country,'' Wiper said in their statement. Dr Mutua said that his support for the President led him to form his own party after leaving Wiper. “I stood with Uhuru before, during and after the 2017 General Elections which did not augur well with Wiper and I took a lot of criticism for it,” Dr Mutua said. On Sunday Deputy President William Ruto while speaking in Matungulu Constituency, Machakos County, applauded Wiper’s move to work with Jubilee. He said that leaders should put aside their political differences for the common good of the country.   A number of MPs from Ukambani say they will support Mr Ruto for presidency in 2022.
