The team was expected back home in the early hours of Tuesday. Echesa and his Principal Secretary Kirimi Kaberia said they were impressed by the teams’ performance and he would continue to support upcoming athletes. “You have done us, as a country, proud and that is why I had to call you we have dinner together as one way of appreciating your good work. It is not easy to be at the top, you did well and congratulations,” said Echesa. Also present was Kenya’s ambassador to Nordic countries, Joel Sang, Athletics Kenya Youth and Development Committee chairman Barnabas Korir among other officials.
