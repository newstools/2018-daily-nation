Mega corruption scandals have characterised Kenya the last couple of months. It is obvious there is a causal relationship between corruption and youth unemployment because of reduced efficiency of the resource allocation and the fact that bureaucrats are more concerned with their own personal interests at the expense of youth welfare. Changing the current scenario in Kenya will take organised groups of young people who are ready to step out with commitment, declare war and stand for a conviction without compromise. INSPIRATION Those who choose to step out should first and foremost understand they will need to have what it takes to influence others through inspiration, motivated by a passion, produced by a conviction and ignited by a purpose to change this country. It is not possible to change the world in silence. Young people must integrate into the community and find convincing reasons for their precarious situations and demand well thought through policies that will safeguard their future. SOCIAL INCLUSION They should explore the policy challenges needed to produce greater social inclusion through more opportunities and better access to all services as stipulated in law. As to whether the Constitution is mutilated or not, is a debate for another day. Young people should train themselves to question and challenge the affairs of this country. They must create a common vision for themselves and understand the process of getting to a common vision and the on-going means for implementing good practices and monitoring are just as important as the policies in place. POLICY AREAS This visioning should traverse all policy areas ranging from housing, manufacturing, education, health, security, environment to ICT. The weaving across the sectors should produce complementarity rather than conflicts. That way they will be able to see potential pilferage before it happens. Young people must also invade the policy space through activism and demand quality service delivery. They must petition for tougher laws against corruption. They should also reflect upon youth movement that will ensure all corrupt leaders are removed from public offices. SERVANTHOOD Public office demands servanthood and not a platform to enrich those in positions together with their relatives. Youth should have their impact felt from the beginning of public officersâ€™ tenure to the end. For example getting involved during the vetting and background checks. They should have the attitude of getting to the problem before it gets to them. In conclusion, we would like to tell the youth it is really about who you are and how you think in relation to the much needed transformation in Kenya. We urge you to discover your identity and discover how thought processes are organised to fulfil your purpose. You must have a personal encounter with yourself; a discovery of your nature, ability, and essence as a human being. Stand to be counted as the people who fought for Kenya.
