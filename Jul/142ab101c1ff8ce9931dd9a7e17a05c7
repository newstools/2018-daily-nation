Two people have died and scores injured following a multiple vehicle crash at Paul Boit (Mwisho wa Forest) on Eldoret-Webuye road. The 6.30pm accident involved a bus belonging Green Line Safaris which was heading to Bungoma, a Modern Coast bus and two trucks that were headed to Eldoret. Witnesses told the Nation that one of the trucks was trying to overtake when it collided head-on with the Green Line Safaris bus. Residents said that the route has claimed many lives due to speeding by drivers.   "This place has become a blackspot. We call on the Kenya National Highways Authority to erect bumps to avert more loss of life, "said Mr John Kemboi, one of the local residents at the accident scene. The injured have been taken to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital.   Eldoret West police boss Zachariah Bitok who visited the accident scene urged drivers plying the route to exercise caution. "The heavy rains have resulted in poor visibility for drivers and made the road slippery,"said Mr Bitok.
