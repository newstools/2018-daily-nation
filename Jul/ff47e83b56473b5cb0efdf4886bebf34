The final event will take place at Strathmore University. A total of 164 Form Fours, 78 boys and 85 girls, who registered high marks at county contests will bring along with them 10 Form Threes each from their school.

NEXT LEVEL Brookside Dairy Marketing Manager Peter Wasonga said the company is ready for the next level of the competition. “We successfully hosted contests in 15 counties and we are looking forward to a very competitive and interesting finale,” said Mr Wasonga. He said the scholarships will be highly contested because all the contestants worked hard to qualify for the nationals. Already a total of 188 students have won secondary school bursaries for the last two years. According to Prof Owiti, 56 percent of Kenyan youth are jobless due to lack of skills.
