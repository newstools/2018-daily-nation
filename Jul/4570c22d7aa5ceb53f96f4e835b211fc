A  Homa Bay couple who had a colourful wedding last Saturday are in agony after unknown people abducted their child and demanded ransom. Their son aged 10, who is a Class Three pupil at a local private school in Rangwe, was reportedly picked up on Tuesday morning at Stage Miwa on the Homa Bay-Rongo road by unkojwn people. His father, Lameck Ogola, who does construction work said  his son was waiting to board a school bus when unknown men driving in a white car forcefully picked him up. "My son was in the company of his elder sister. They were going to school when some strangers asked them to board the car. His sister said the men identified the boy by his name," he said. According to Mr Ogola, attempts by his son to refuse did not succeed as they forcibly dragged him into the car. His sister went back home to report what had happened. Mr Ogola told journalists that he has been receiving unknown calls from people telling him that they know the whereabouts of his son. "The callers have asked for a ransom or kill my son if I do not deliver their demand," he said. On Monday, an unknown motorcyclist had attempted to take the minor and his sister from school but their teachers refused. Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum said  they are working on leads of the whereabouts of the suspected kidnappers. "We call on the public to offer information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects. We will ensure that the minor is rejoined with his family," said Mr Tum. Mr Ogola recently had a wedding that was attended by politicians from Homa Bay County including National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi, Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino, and former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga among other leaders. "The abductors think that I have a lot of money because politicians attended my wedding on Saturday. All I got were just presents," he said.
