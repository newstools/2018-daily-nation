The recent crackdown on foreigners working in the country illegally, in which thousands of suspects were arrested, has confirmed the need to streamline the issuance of work permits. Whereas only 35,000 permits were found to have been issued through the proper channels, conservative estimates indicate that up to 100,000 foreigners could be beneficiaries of illegal recruitment. What this means is that some unscrupulous people or cartels are denying Kenyans opportunities they deserve and handing them to out to foreigners. During the swoop led by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, it was also established that some crooked officials issue the permits to unqualified foreigners for a Sh100,000 bribe. PROPER DOCUMENTS We fully support the Immigration Department’s efforts to get all the foreigners working in Kenya to regularise their stay by obtaining proper documents. They were last month given 60 days to do this, failure to which they will be arrested and deported. It’s quite possible that thousands could have escaped the dragnet, and are hoping that the vigilance will be relaxed so they can resume their operations. While it’s true that like any other country, Kenya needs foreigners with skills that are not readily available, these must be properly recruited and registered. SEMI-SKILLED FOREIGNERS This calls for strict monitoring so that the country is not flooded with semi-skilled foreigners locking Kenyans out of jobs at a time when youth unemployment is a huge challenge. With the rampant corruption, the problem cannot be totally eradicated. This is why we laud CS Matiang’i’s announcement that foreigners seeking Kenyan work permits will now have to apply for them in their own country, and only come over once they are approved. It will make it easier to vet the arrivals at the point of entry and ensure that they only take up jobs that it has been confirmed are available.
