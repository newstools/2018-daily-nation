Isiolo County government has lifted meat and milk ban imposed last month following outbreak of Rift Valley Fever disease. County Livestock minister Mohamud Haji said the disease has been contained “Following a 13-day successful ring vaccination exercise in affected areas within Isiolo, Merti and Garba Tula sub-counties, we have lifted the ban and locals can now consume livestock products,” said Mr Haji. No new cases of the disease have been reported. The outbreak only affected livestock prompting the administration to roll out a vaccination exercise that was co-funded by Regional Pastoral Livelihoods Resilience Project. At least 300,000 animals in the region were vaccinated with the process still ongoing in other areas. The outbreak is suspected to have spread from the neighbouring Wajir County which lifted its ban on consumption of livestock products last week. Six people and hundreds of livestock died in Wajir County following the outbreak.   Quarantine limiting movement of livestock imposed in wake of Rift Valley Fever outbreak.
