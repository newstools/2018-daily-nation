Kenyans have reacted with disbelieve and shock after the national sevens team squandered a comfortable 26-5 lead with four minutes to go to lose to Scotland 31-26 and exit the Rugby World Cup Sevens in the round of 16 stage on Saturday. It was simply tragic and heartbreaking when Samuel Oliech and Samuel Njenga were sin-binned in quick succession to let Scotland, who were trailing, to win at the death and sail through to the Cup quarterfinals. “Beautiful game. Unfortunate loss. Always great to see @KenyaSevens confirm we are indeed #MagicalKenya #RWC7s,” President Uhuru Kenyatta sought to encourage Kenya Sevens after the shocking loss on Twitter. “I have no words to explain this game,” said Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Richard Omwela, who is with the team in San Francisco, USA for the Rugby World Cup. Omwela had promised radical changes in Kenya Sevens team immediately after the San Francisco championship. Legendary Edward Rombo, who is also in San Francisco posted on his Facebook page: “Sad end to a promising day but our "spirits" will not be broken off the pitch.” Shocked at how fast Kenya exited the World Cup, Jah Juok, an ardent Kenya Sevens fan said posted on Facebook: “World Cup imeisha tuu hivo (World Cup just ended).” Kenneth Thimba, former Kenya 15s coach said on Facebook: “The empty hollow feeling after that loss.......how now K7s.” “Boycott second half,” Walter Orangi joked on Facebook. “It is not the critics who counts... The credit belongs to the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again... because they try... that's @KenyaSevens,” said Brand Kenya, Kenya Sevens sponsors on Twitter.   It was simply heartbreaking when Kenya let Scotland, who were trailing 28-17 at the death, win.
