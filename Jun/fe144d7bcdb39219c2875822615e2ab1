Youngster Leo Zurovac beat a large field of 180 golfers at the tough and long playing Vet Lab Sports Club course over the weekend, to emerge the overall winner in the first leg of this year’s CIC Group golf series. The 14-year-old Zurovac scratched the par four-10th and hit his driver to the bunker and his approach shot to the water, though he parred five holes and picked up one birdie there after for 19 points in the back nine and a total of 38 points. “My approach shots were my biggest advantage today though I hit a couple of bad shots off the tee. It could have been better though i am happy winning this event," said Zurovac, who finished second in the annual Geomax tournament last month. He had parred four holes and bogeyed one at the front nine, where he also dropped shots at the third, fourth, fifth and the eighth. He won on countback from men winner Francis Kimathi, who had also combined 19 and 19 to also finish on 38 points. In second place in the men’s section was George Ketem on 37 points.
