The final decision on the commercial production of oil by Tullow in the the South Lokichar Basin will be made in the last quarter of next year, the company has said in a statement. This follows the awarding of two contracts last month, one for upstream front-end engineering and design (FEED) that is intended to set a system to direct oil to the ground level and the other for integrated project management. The contracts cover management services and engineering, procurement and construction. “The Kenya development plan is progressing well and the project remains on track for FID [final investment decision] in late 2019,” the company said. The FEED and the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) work for the upstream initial or foundation stage is currently under way, Tullow Oil said.

This is part of the early production scheme intended to provide some of the data for the FID. The engineering and environmental work for the pipeline is also being carried out. “FEED and the ESIA work for the pipeline is also progressing to plan and commercial discussions continue with potential pipeline contractors,” said the firm. Ngamia-8 is already contributing oil to the early oil that is currently being transported for storage at the Kenya Petroleum Oil Refinery in Mombasa.
