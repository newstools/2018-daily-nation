Twenty high school students on Saturday showcased a collection of photographs at the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa following a week-long workshop. The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) organised the workshop in partnership with the Frederic Roberts Photography Workshop. The students, aged 14 and 15, had never used a camera before the workshop. Participating students were drawn from the Aga Khan Academy Mombasa and other schools that partner with AKDN, including Aga Khan High school in Mombasa, Waa Boys High school and Tiwi Girls Secondary school from Kwale. Students went into a real-life assignment in Mombasa, as a photojournalist would, and took photographs for a 'story'. During the graduation, the guest speaker, Dr Najya Muhammed, lauded the organisers for choosing to teach photography to young people. “From the photos, the precision they have learnt is just amazing. What I have seen is the contrast in terms of light, darkness, contrast in terms of rust and paint, in terms of movement. The balance is just superb. You can feel that you are part of the photographer,” she said. She said the workshop also provided an opportunity to learn about diversity of people and foster unity. “These kids worked together as one and produced this amazing work,” she said. More importantly, she said the workshop has also boosted the confidence of the students. Frederic Roberts, an award-winning photographer, said the participants gained professional skills and did everything by themselves. “Whatever they wanted to create, they created. They had two days of camera instruction and then we sent them out to shoot the story. At the end of the second day, they had skills of a professional photographer,” he said. Ms Halima Nasir, 14-year-old Tiwi Girls Secondary School student, said the workshop has allowed her to take photographs using a professional camera. “I am in Form one and I learnt how to take pictures using a quality camera,” she said.
