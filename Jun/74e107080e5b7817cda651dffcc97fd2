The national 100m champion Maximilla Imali from Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI), tore apart the blue tartan track at the Kasarani, to set a new national record in the discipline as the two-day Kenya Police Service Athletics Championships ended on Thursday. The 22-year-old Imali, who also holds the national 400m record, clocked 11.38 seconds, smashing the two years and nine months old record of 11.47 held by Eunice Kadogo set at the 2015 African Games in Congo Brazzaville where she won silver. The day also belonged to Rose Rakamba, who set new Kenya Police women’s hammer and discus throw records, hauling distances of 48.81m and 49.26m respectively. Imali edged out Millicent Ndoro from Rift Valley who finished second in 11.89m, as Kenya Police College’s Kadogo came in third in 11.96. Imali, who cracked 51.18 for a new national record at the National Championships last year, attributed her performance to change of training programme by her new coach Peter Gatana. “I am actually using the 100m and 200m, races to fine tune ahead of the National Championships,” said Imali, who also edged out the much-improved Ndoro to second place in the 200m, missing the national 200m record by only 0.3 seconds. Imali clocked a personal best of 23.40 against Ndoro’s 23.95, which was also a personal best with Kadogo taking third place in 24.16. Peter Ndichu of Kenya Police College (KPC) claimed a double as he won the men’s 100m and 200m in 10.37 and 20.83 respectively. As expected, World and Commonwealth 1,500m champion Elijah Manangoi from Presidential Escort Unit (PEU) won his 800m race with ease, clocking 1:45.20 to beat teammate Jeremiah Mutai in 1:46.24, as General Service Unit’s (GSU’s) Gideon Chepkonga settled for third in 1:48.69. Emily Cherotich (Central) retained her 800m title in 2:01.13, beating Eglay Nalianya (Nairobi) in 2:01.82. The 2015 World 400m hurdles champion Nicholas Bett completed a double retaining his 400m hurdles in 49.4, before going for the 400m flat crown, clocking 46.2 to improve his personal best from 46.76 set on January 27 this year in Pretoria, South Africa. In the 400m race, Bett beat Job Tendererzi from GSU and Job Kinyor from Administration Training Police College (APTC) in 47.7 and 48.00 respectively. Bett outclassed defending champion Kiprono Kosgei (GSU) to second place in the 400m hurdles in 54.4, as Gilbert Koech (KPC) settled for third in 54.9. Commonwealth 1,500m silver medallist Beatrice Chepkoech retained the women’s 3,000m steeplechase and 1,500m titles, before snatching the women’s 400m hurdles. Chepkoech clocked 10:00.6 to win in steeplechase, before timing 4:07.69 for 1,500m glory, beating the 2013 World 800m champion Eunice Sum to second in 4:10.63. Chepkoech would claim the 400m hurdles crown in 60.7. The 2015 World 3,000m steeplechase champion Hyvin Kiyeng claimed the women’s 5,000m crown in 15:46.5, beating Pascalia Jepkorir in 15:48.8, as Edith Chelimo came in third in 15:50.0.
