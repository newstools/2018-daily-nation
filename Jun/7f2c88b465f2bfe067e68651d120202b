The world is abuzz with the news of the first meeting ever between sitting leaders of the United States and the reclusive North Korea. Mr Kim Jong-Un confounded doubters by heading to Singapore for the ground-breaking summit with Mr Donald Trump. There may still be some doubts over whether something constructive will come out of this rare encounter and quell the fears over nuclear proliferation. However, the significance of the historic handshake between the two is indisputable. DIPLOMATIC COUP This is a second diplomatic coup for Mr Kim following yet another first, his recent historic meeting with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in. Some have described Tuesday’s summit as ending with “vague pledges of nuclear disarmament” but they would, perhaps, take some solace in a Chinese saying that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This initial contact indicates a willingness on both sides to secure the world from a nuclear holocaust. PERSONAL TRIUMPH For Mr Trump, it’s a personal triumph for a leader whose foreign policy credentials have been frequently mocked and denigrated for lack of depth and predictability. We could not agree more with US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel that the Trump-Kim summit was a “major step towards historic peace”. Indeed, the stage has been set and the momentum should be seized to relentlessly strive for a more secure world.
