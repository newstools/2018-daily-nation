The government has declared Friday a public holiday to accord Kenyans an opportunity to make preparations to mark Idd-ul-Fitr to be celebrated on Saturday. The declaration is contained in a gazette notice issued by Interior Cabinet Secretary (CS) Fred Matiang’i. “In exercise of powers conferred by Section 3 of the Public Holidays Act, Friday, the June 15, 2018 shall be a public holiday in order to accord all Kenyans and persons who profess the Islamic faith the opportunity to make preparations to mark Idd-ul-Fitr on Saturday, June 16, 2018,” CS Matiang’i said in a press statement issued by the ministry’s communication director Mwenda Njoka. Muslims begun fasting on May 17, which marked the start of the holy month. Idd ul-Fitr is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of Ramadhan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. Idd ul-Fitr was originated by the Islamic prophet Muhammad.  The date for the start of the fasting month varies based on the sighting of the new moon by local religious leaders, so the exact day of celebration varies with locality.
