An attempt by auctioneers to attach troubled Chemelil Sugar Company's properties failed after workers ganged up to obstruct them from accessing the firm's premises Wednesday. According to Muhoroni Sub County Peace Monitor Oscar Onyango, auctioneers from West Kenya Sugar Company raided the State miller's offices after Chemelil failed to pay the cost of a suit slapped on them by a court. “They arrived on Wednesday morning prepared with breakdowns in a bid to take away some of the vehicles among other properties belonging to Chemelil Sugar,” said Mr Onyango who witnessed the drama. However, few staff members who had reported to work mobilised nearby farmers and traders and successfully managed to secure the miller's property. They later held demonstrations to Muhoroni Deputy County Commissioner’s office at the old Chemelil market where they barricaded the road for over five hours. Chemelil Sugar MD, Gabriel Nyangweso, could not be reached to verify details of the dispute with West Kenya as he was holed up in a meeting at Kilimo House in Nairobi.
