Embu ward representatives have hit the road to seek residents’ views on an amendment bill that seeks to give the public power to decide whether contractors will be paid after completion of county infrastructure projects. The amendment to the Embu County Public Participation Act, 2015 will allow the residents evaluate finished projects and give recommendations for payment based on the quality of work done. Public Participation Committee Chairman Martin Mwangi said if the amendment is passed, no contractor will be paid if the residents will not satisfied by their workmanship. In addition, the bill will give the residents the power to endorse or reject proposed infrastructure projects. Mr Mwangi said the move is aimed at eliminating shoddy workmanship and white elephants projects, a trend that is commonplace amongst unscrupulous contractors whose goal is to make quick profits at the expense of taxpayers. The amendment bill will also require every department of the county executive to first consult Embu residents at the ward level before embarking on any development project to establish whether it is a priority for them. Kagaari South MCA Robert Ireri has expressed support for the proposed amendment. Mr Ireri said there should be a feedback channel to inform county residents how their views influence law-making. The Public Participation Committee also wants the county executive to be providing periodic reports on every public forum they hold to promote residents’ involvement in governance affairs.
