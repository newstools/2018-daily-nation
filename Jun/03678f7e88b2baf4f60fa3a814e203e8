Police in Mwatate have launched investigations after a 15-year-old pupil claimed she was defiled a head teacher in his office. A medical examination conducted at Mwatate Sub-County Hospital revealed that the student was sexually assaulted. The parents are now demanding arrest and prosecution of the head teacher whom the pupil said defiled her as punishment for alleged lack of discipline. “We were cleaning the class and one pupil came in with dirty feet and was slapped by my colleagues. He reported to the head teacher who summoned us to his office,” the pupil said. She claimed that one of pupils cracked a joke and they all laughed. “The teacher told us were indisciplined and he slapped me. Unfortunately, I slapped back,” she said. It was then, the pupil said, that the head teacher ordered the other pupils to leave and locked her inside. The girl said the head teacher then assaulted her and later took her to the school director who then expelled her. “I was even scared to tell my mother, so I told my aunts on Saturday. They are the ones who took me to the hospital,” she said. Mwatate OCPD Monica Kimani said they are investigating the matter. “I take issues of gender-based violence with seriousness. No child will be discriminated against as long as I am the OCPD here,” she said.
