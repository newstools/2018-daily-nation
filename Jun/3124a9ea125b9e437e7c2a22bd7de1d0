Hi Brenda, I was in a taxi the other day and I had a great conversation with the driver. The ride was like 45 minutes long and he was really interesting. When he dropped me home and I paid, I said goodnight and left. I thought it was over, but he texted me saying he hopes I sleep well. He hasn't texted since, but what if he does? Is that weird? There was a connection, but I'm just unsure about his methods...  Ok, that's a bit weird. No, it isn't just a bit weird, it's a lot weird. Not because guys shouldn't hit on you, but because in this situation, he has a lot more power. If he wanted to text you, he could have asked as you left â€“ seeing as he's supposed to be working. He has access to your number and is willing to use it, and, he knows where you live. It could be innocent, but considering the fact that it was unprofessional, he didn't ask permission, and he knows where he can find you...his method is weird. You're not being crazy, and you should be unsure about it. If there was a connection, he could have just asked, no? Instead of going the creepy stalker way? If he texts, consider either having a conversation with him on what's appropriate and what's not, or, report him to the taxi service. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
