A last-minute plan to install Daniel Manduku as the acting managing director of the Kenya Ports Authority, despite a court order reinstating Catherine Mturi-Wairi, was called off by the management. On Tuesday, confusion rocked the giant parastatal after the management vowed to install Dr Manduku despite a court order, but the plan was later called off. The management has remained mum over the matter. Ms Wairi was on Wednesday last week sent on compulsory leave and subsequently replaced by Dr Manduku in an acting capacity. The decision to send Ms Wairi on a two-month compulsory leave was reached after a special board of management meeting. The meeting was chaired by a board member Mr Michael Maina with the Transport Principal Secretary Paul Maringa in attendance. According to the board, inefficiency and cargo clearance delays at the port of Mombasa contributed to Ms Wairi ouster from the management of one of the largest ports in Africa, less than two years after her appointment. Suspended decision But the High Court Tuesday suspended the forced exit of Ms Wairi and the subsequent appointment of Daniel Manduku to the position in an acting capacity. Judge Eric Ogola on Tuesday issued the temporary order suspending the implementation of the decision of the KPA's board of directors to send Ms Wairi on leave and appoint Dr Manduku. In a dramatic twist, KPA officials sent invites to journalist some few minutes after the High Court issued the order. In the invite, KPA's senior communications officer Sylvan Mghanga said the handing over would take place at the Mombasa port today (Wednesday). “I wish to invite you to provide media coverage for the handing-over ceremony for the KPA managing director at the headquarters,” read the invite.
