The trial of a Makueni man accused of almost severing his cousin’s manhood four years ago began Monday. Mr John Musau told a Kilungu court that Mr Martin Ndini waylaid him on his way from Muangini Market  on the evening of October 19, 2014, and attacked him. “He said  he would kill me,” Musau, 36, told the court. “He then hit me on the head with a wooden plank and after I fell down, he stepped on my chest.” Mr Musai said   the accused then dragged him to the bank of   River Wautu, stripped him naked and almost severed his penis before fleeing,  leaving him bleeding and unconscious. He said that when he came to nearly 10 hours later, he took a little-used path by the river and went home, where he woke up his mother. She alerted other relatives and neighbours, who rushed him to Sultan Hamud Hospital for treatment. He was admitted for 14 days. In her testimony, Mr Musau’s mother told the court that the accused had threatened to kill her son the day before the incident. “I had served them a meal and as they ate, I heard Martin threaten to kill Musau one day,” said Ms Catherine Musyoka. Before the incident, Mr Musau and his cousin were sharing a bedroom. After the attack, Mr Ndini went into hiding. Then on Wednesday last week, Mr Musau saw him  at  Kasikeu Market and raised the alarm. Mr Murini was seized by boda boda operators and take to  the Assistant County Commissioner’s office at Kasikeu Market. The prosecution sought an adjournment since a doctor at Sultan Hamud Hospital who is lined up to testify was absent. Senior Resident Magistrate  Charles Mayamba pushed the trial to today (Tuesday) when the doctor is expected to testify.
