Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko wants local communities involved in efforts to enhance socio-economic growth. Addressing journalists at Hillpark Hotel in Kwale County, Mr Tobiko said the gap between scientists, policymakers and communities has made tackling environmental issues and problems a tall order. "We leaders tend to sit at our offices and give out polices assuming that communities are not aware of conservation measures yet they are the ones who have been planting these trees using their traditional scientific techniques," he said. Mr Tobiko added that it is vital to recognise and understand the contexts indigenous people operate in and their ways of conserving the environment. "We have to engage local communities at every level to protect our most precious natural assets against selfish people seeking to make profits." He lauded Mikoko Pamoja initiative, saying it is the best example of how communities are safeguarding the environment. Mikoko Pamoja is a community-led mangrove conservation and restoration effort. It is run by volunteers from Gazi and Makongeni villages in Msambweni Sub-County. Through the project the community generates revenue for development activities.
