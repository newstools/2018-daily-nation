Soccer Sisters Football Club from Dagoretti South Constituency in Nairobi County are the Football Kenya Federation Division One Zone A log leaders after the first round of seven matches, unbeaten. The team which is run by Mutuini Hope Centre – a foundation that supports education and talent development in Mutuini Ward – is seeking to finish on top of the standings table unbeaten. Head coach Andrew Juma on Friday said his charges are well prepared for the next round. “It is only the level of officiating which might let me down. We got two draws and five wins in the first round but the match officials in several instances were not up to the task. We have raised the issue with the Federation and it is being addressed, thankfully,” he told Nation Sport during a training session at Kirigu Primary School grounds in Dagoretti South. The team lost six players to Makolanders FC, Soccer Queens and Kibera Girls after they were relegated from Football Kenya Federation women’s premier league last season. The main reasons for their relegation was failing to honour fixtures and lack of a proper training ground for the ladies. “I had a hard time rebuilding the team. Thankfully, ladies in the neighbourhood accepted my call to them to play soccer. We are now a formidable team,” he said. Mbugua Mwangi, the director of Mutuini Hope Centre, said they are seeking a corporate partner to ensure the team continues with the good run and even goes back to the premier league. “Lack of funds forced the team to miss several matches last season and hence we were relegated. We are trying our best this time round to stay in the game with the little resources we get and we hope to soon get a partner to help the girls keep playing,” he added. The coach has set his sights on winning the title with the team which is the only club representing the Constituency in the league.
