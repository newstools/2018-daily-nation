Government officials yesterday admitted that there has been laxity at points of entry, enabling unscrupulous businessmen to import contraband goods into the country. Deputy Head of Public Service Wanyama Musiambo said impunity costs the country a lot of revenue and exposing Kenyans to health risks. Mr Musiambo, who inspected contraband goods worth Sh1.2 billion seized by Kenya Revenue Authority, the Anti-Counterfeit Agency and the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs), said the government was now keen on doing more to ensure that such goods do not reach consumers. KRA seized the goods which included China Police attire, undergarments, electric cables, cooking oil, assorted cigarettes and other goods over the last two months, after President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the agencies to crack down on counterfeits and contrabands. Interior Cabinet Secretary, Fred Matiang’i warned administrative officials involved in gambling that they will be sacked. Dr Matiang’i who officiated at the burning of illegal gambling machines and shisha urns at the Dagoretti South Sub-County headquarters, asked the public to report all administrators found to be complicit in illegal gambling as well as illicit alcohol and drugs.   Sweetener imported from Brazil was being repackaged as Comesa sugar in Meru.
