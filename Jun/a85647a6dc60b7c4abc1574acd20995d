Coast Water Services Board (CWSB) has disconnected supply to Voi town and its environs over unpaid Sh411m bill as standoff with Taita Taveta County escalates. Following the disconnection, a biting water shortage has hit the town with vendors selling the commodity at high prices. Recently, Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja said the county will not settle the bill and threatened to dissolve the company. Mr Samboja accused the water firm of frustrating coastal counties. But Taita Taveta Water minister, Mr Jasper Kabaka, said they have entered into a debt repayment plan with the CWSB even though the firms has not yet turned the water back on. “Yesterday [Saturday] we paid Sh2 million but I must say that the firm is out to frustrate us,” claimed Mr Kabaka.
