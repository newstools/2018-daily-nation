Kenyans will have to wait longer to know the cause of the FlySax plane accident that killed 10 people in the Aberdares, the Nation has learnt. On Monday, a team of  investigators made a torturous journey to the scene of the accident at the peak of the Aberdares, where they assembled and documented 32 two pieces of exhibits to be used in establishing the cause of the accident. During the three-hour exercise, they collected samples of fuel, laptop hard disks, power banks and parts of the plane. However, according to Kinangop Deputy County Commissioner Daniel Nyameti, the investigations on the cause of the crash will be conducted in Kitale, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and the Aberdares. FORENSIC EXPERTS It also emerged that the investigators’ file will be handed over to the Director of Public Prosecutions for further directions after the exercise. The investigators will include bomb and forensic experts, pathologists among other specialists. At the same time, an investigation into a similar plane crash that killed five people on October 21, 2017 in Lake Nakuru is yet to be concluded, according to the Aircraft Accident Investigations Division (AAID).
