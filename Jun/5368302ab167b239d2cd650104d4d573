Chaos broke out in Matungu, Kakamega County after two rival groups clashed. The groups supporting Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and Sports CS Rashid Echesa pelted stones at each other at Mayoni shopping centre on Friday evening. Mr Malala's convoy was first attacked by young men who were chanting pro-Echesa songs. The senator was heading to Mumias after he launched a private medical training school in Makale, Matungu. The young men were armed with stones and clubs. Mumias police boss Peter Kattam said vehicles were destroyed but no one was injured in the fracas. Mr Echesa was not immediately available for comment. While addressing a crowd at Fafa Medical College, Mr Malala in his speech, asked Mr Echesa to stop supporting youths campaigning for the revival of Mumias Sugar Company. "He should instead use his position as a Cabinet Secretary and write a memo to the President asking him to fund revival programmes of the sugar miller," Mr Malala said. He also criticised the CS for holding a government position and he does not have a post-secondary education. Mr Echesa became the first Cabinet minister since the 2010 Constitution to hold such a post without a post-secondary academic qualification.During his vetting for the position, he told a parliamentary committee that poverty kept him away from school but argued he had been a sportsman focusing on boxing.
