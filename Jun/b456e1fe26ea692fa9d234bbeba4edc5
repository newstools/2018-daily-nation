The Kenya Ports Authority board will hold its first sitting next week to decide on the recruitment of the new managing director to replace Ms Catherine Mturi-Wairi. The board sent Ms Wairi on compulsory leave two weeks ago, citing inefficiency. Ms Wairi has since resigned. Transport PS Paul Maringa said yesterday the recruitment of the new MD is a competitive process to be conducted by the board. Prof Maringa said acting MD Daniel Manduku was deployed to the organisation from the National Construction Authority (NCA) , where he is the CEO under the Short Term Deployment - an internal arrangement in State agencies especially when facing challenges. “The legal administrative procedure is that an MD cannot be confirmed when appropriate interviews have not been conducted by the board,” he said. Prof Maringa said the appointment is done in an independent manner, where an audit firm is picked to guide the board in the process of advertisement and eventual recruitment. He said Dr Manduku is free to go for the interviews, and return to NCA if he fails.   Dr Manduku says he is optimistic about improving efficiency at the port of Mombasa.
