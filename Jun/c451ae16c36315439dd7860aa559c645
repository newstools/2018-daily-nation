Embu County Assembly will pay gym subscription for its 33 ward reps and 80 staff members to help them reduce weight. Speaker Josiah Thiriku said he had noted many ward representatives had gained weight that could take a toll on them as they perform their legislative duties. Mr Thiriku encouraged the MCAs to embrace a healthy lifestyle by exercising. “I have realised that members now need to keep fit; all of us have added weight,” he told the MCAs. The county assembly's sports and fitness kitty has been allocated Sh11 million while gym fees was calculated at Sh3,000 per month per individual.
