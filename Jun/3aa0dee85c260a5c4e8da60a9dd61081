Search for the missing light aircraft that went missing as it headed to the Jomo Kenyatta airport has been called off. The search was halted due to bad weather in the Aberdares and will resume Thursday at 6am, Nyandarua County Commissioner Boaz Cherutich said. “We leave it to the mercies of the Almighty God and hope the weather improves tomorrow,” Mr Cherutich said, adding “Other than the missing craft’s signal, the team has not received any communication from the passengers and crew.” Mr Cherutich said officials have established a command post and mobilised enough resources including seven helicopters for search and rescue mission. Gloomy weather personified the general mood engulfing Njabini village, about 30 kilometres from Naivasha town, following the disappearance of the aircraft. Locals, mesmerised by the high number of choppers circling the air, rushed to the Njabini grounds to catch a glimpse of the happenings. Helicopters that landed at intervals included one from the Police Airwing, KWS and private ones. The missing aircraft, which had 10 people on board is operated by FlySax.   The condition of the eight passengers and crew is not yet known.
