A student was raped at Moi Girls High School Nairobi on Saturday, Kilimani OCPD Michael Muchiri has confirmed. Mr Muchiri on Saturday evening said that no one has been arrested but investigations are ongoing. "This is an active investigation. The school administration is cooperating with the police to establish the depth of the matter at hand. Detectives are following up on important leads," he said. He said the Form Two student was taken to hospital for treatment. It is reported that she was attacked when she went to the lavatory outside her dormitory, and that she did not identify her attacker. OCPD Muchiri could not confirm claims that two other students were also raped. "We are only investigating the matter concerning the Form Two student. We are talking about one girl," he added.
