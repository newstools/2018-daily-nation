As the world marked the third Global Running Day on Wednesday, elite Kenyan stars — led by Tokyo Marathon champion Dickson Chumba — converged on Tulon Primary School in Nandi County to mentor young runners. The County Government of Nandi in conjunction with athletes from the “2 Running Club”, including world 800 metres champion Eunice Sum, staged several races for excited school children. Chumba, an alumnus of Tulon Primary School, pledged to assist pupils with an interest in taking up athletics as a career. “I was a pupil here and I want to always urge them to follow my footsteps and become stars in future. I will always be there to assist them and give support where they need me,” said Chumba. Other athletes who marked the day at the school included another former 800m world champion Janeth Jepkosgei, former Paris Marathon champion Cyprian Kotut and former London Marathon champion Prisca Jeptoo. “I have mentored many youths, and I’m very happy to see young ones running all the time. I will always support them in the coming days,” said Jepkosgei. Nandi County sports executive Elly Kurgat said organising the day at the school would inspire the pupils to take up athletics seriously.
