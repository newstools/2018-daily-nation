An Egyptian was sentenced to six months in prison by a Nakuru court on Friday after he pleaded guilty to operating business in the country without a permit. The magistrate said such cases were rampant in Nakuru and the sentence handed to him was suitable. “There have been several cases of foreigners operating without business permits reported in court lately and it’s a vice that must be dealt with,” said the magistrate. Mr Mohamed Abouelwafa was also charged with being in the country illegally while on a visitor’s visa which was invalidated by the offence. He entered Kenya on January 2.   Majority of those arrested did not have work permits.
