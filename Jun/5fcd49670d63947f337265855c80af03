Cases of Kenyan athletes collapsing and dying while in training or competitions are becoming common. More than 10 sports stars have so far died in these circumstances recently yet no thorough investigations have been carried out to unravel the causes. The latest case is that of Mount Kenya University basketball player Stephen Imboche Musundi, who died during a National Division One League match in Kakamega. MEDICAL CHACK-UPS The Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) now wants all clubs to ensure their players undergo regular medical check-ups. Last year, Charles Maroa collapsed and died after winning his half-marathon race during the Kilimanjaro Marathon while David Kiprotich died in training in Kaptagat. Also to pass on was Noah Evar in Iten. In 2016, the 2014 Africa Youth Games silver medallist, Ian Mutuku, died in Machakos while former Kenya Under-20 international athlete Sheila Chepng’etich died last month in Kericho. We support KBF chairman Paul Otula’s calls for clubs to ensure their players undergo health checks before matches. But the athletes should also take charge of their health. Some deaths have been linked to supplements and banned performance-enhancing drugs. Sports federations need to investigate this and crack down on clubs and agents who may be involved.
