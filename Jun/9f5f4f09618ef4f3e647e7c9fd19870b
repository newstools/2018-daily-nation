Kenya Sevens failed to reach the Cup quarterfinals for the second time this season when they lost to England 38-12 at the London Sevens on Saturday at Twickenham Stadium, England. What perhaps crocked Kenya’s chances was the 19-19 draw against United States of America even as they recovered to beat France 24-21 in their second Pool “C” match. Kenya, who had reached seven Cup quarterfinals this season, failing only in South Africa, now meet Spain in the Challenge Trophy quarterfinals at 11.52am on Sunday. USA finished on top of the Pool after crushing France 38-12 as they qualified for the Cup quarterfinals alongside Series leaders Fiji and New Zealand from Pool “A” where defending London Sevens champions Scotland were casualties. Also easing through to the Cup quarters were Australia and surprise package Ireland from Pool “B” and South Africa and Canada from Pool “D”. Fiji, winners in New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, face Canada (12.58pm), USA are up against Ireland (1.20pm) while South Africa take on New Zealand at 1.42pm. Australia play England in the last Cup quarter at 2.04pm.   Injera attributed his success in the sport to his elder brother.
