Hi Brenda, I'm always the other woman. This is a problem I have been living with for almost 23 years. Please help. You've been the other woman for 23 years? That's not ok, especially considering that it sounds like you're unhappy with the state of affairs. Why have you been in relationships the whole time, or is it that maybe relationships aren't your thing? They aren't everyone's thing, you know. Not everyone has to be in one to feel complete or live a fulfilled life. How do you end up in these situations? Do the men tell you before or afterwards that you're the side chick? If after, I am hoping that you don't stay with them, because clearly this is something you are not ok with. If before, then this speaks to a deeper problem. Why don't you mind being the side chick? What has told you that it is so imperative to have a man, to the point that you must share him? It's ok to be alone, my dear. Like I said, relationships aren't for everyone, and they're clearly hurting you more than helping you. Perhaps it's time to let go of that part of your life and focus on your relationship with yourself. Travel. Read books. Love yourself enough to leave these lying fools. Your future self will appreciate it.  Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? E-mail: lifeanstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   My girlfriends say it is the reason my relationships don't work.
