Kenya Ports Authority Managing Director Catherine Mturi-Wairi has resigned, barely a week after being reinstated, bringing to an end a 25-year career at the agency. Transport Principal Secretary Paul Maringa confirmed that the besieged director resigned on Friday. Ms Wairi had been sent on compulsory leave last month by the board of directors over alleged inefficiencies at the Mombasa port. However, she was reinstated after activist Okiya Omtatah moved to court to challenge the forced exit. The resignation came against a backdrop of two court cases filed at the High Court and Labour Court challenging the board’s decision. According to the resignation letter, that was widely shared on social media, Ms Wairi said she quit to pursue personal interests. “I do wish to register through you, my sincere appreciation to the president for granting me the opportunity to serve the maritime industry and the people of Kenya at large as the managing director Kenya Ports Authority,” the letter to Cabinet Secretary James Macharia read in part. She also expressed “willingness and availability” to the president and the country to serve in any capacity.   Coast leaders want acting managing director removed because he is not a local.
