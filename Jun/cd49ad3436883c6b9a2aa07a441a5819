There are only a few counties where governors and their deputies work in harmony. In most places, the deputies have been relegated to mere observers as their bosses run the show. Whereas the drafters of the Constitution envisaged a situation where the two would complement each other, the reality is to the contrary. In Nairobi, the deputy governor threw in the towel five months ago and the position remains vacant. Mr Polycarp Igathe quit in January, lamenting his failure to gain the confidence of his boss. RUN THE SHOW As a private sector practitioner, he had been drafted into the Governor Mike Sonko’s team to provide the expertise that would be lacking in the politician. It didn’t work, and Mr Sonko continues to run the show alone, complaints about lacklustre performance and service poor delivery notwithstanding. The latest scene of conflict between a governor and his deputy has been playing out in Kiambu. It has been simmering for a while, but now Deputy Governor James Nyoro has come out to publicly reveal that he has actually been sidelined in the running of the county. ONE-MAN SHOW He accuses his boss, Governor Ferdinand Waititu, of running a one-man show. Again, when Dr Nyoro was chosen as Mr Waititu’s running mate, it was so that he provides what his boss lacks in management skills and experience. It’s important that the roles of deputy governors be clearly defined and entrenched in the law.
