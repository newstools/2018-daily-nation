A senator has expressed concern over a move by several counties to introduce laws that bar the media from covering some of their functions. Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua said he was shocked during a recent meeting between some members of the Senate and county officials when a county assembly speaker elaborated how they dealt with the media over “unfair reporting.” “Media does not exist to please leadership, neither do they exist  to sing praises to the powers that be…it is time to stop such happenings,” he said in Naivasha during a retreat by members of the Senate Committee on Information and Communication Technology. FREEDOM The senator, a former media practitioner himself, called on all the stakeholders to grant the media the necessary freedom to carry out its mandate. Speaking in Naivasha during a retreat by members of the Senate Committee on Information and Communication Technology on Sunday, Mr Wambua said the media was the public watchdog. The Media Council of Kenya chief executive officer, David Omwoyo echoed Mr Wambua’s sentiments, saying some of the laws were impeding journalists from carrying out their work. “Some of these laws are against the Constitution and against the provision of the media freedom,” he said. DATA PROTECTION Mr Omwoyo called on the office of the Attorney General to advise the devolved units that certain laws were in contravention of the Constitution and against the national values. “Counties might be autonomous but certain laws cannot just be passed, especially those in breach of the constitution,” said the CEO. Senate ICT committee chairman, Gideon Moi said they were deliberating with non-state actors and share views on the happenings in the sector. He lauded the Data Protection Bill, saying it was aimed at regulating the content especially in the social media. Mr Moi said the bill will ensure some personal data was not used without the consent of the owners.
