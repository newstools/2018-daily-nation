More than 100 police officers have been deployed in various parts of Lamu County as hundreds of Muslims celebrate Idd-ul-Fitr, festival marking end of the holy month of Ramadhan. Speaking to the Nation on Friday, Lamu County Police Commander Muchangi Kioi said police have increased patrols especially on the Lamu-Garsen road which is busy this time of the year as relatives travel to join kin in celebrations. Mr Kioi said security has also been intensified in all villages in Lamu and areas bordering the Boni Forest. He said adequate security officers, uniformed and plain clothed, have also been deployed to man five key jetties which are the main entry to Lamu Old Town, a Muslim hub and a tourist destination. The five entry points are Mokowe customs, Manda airport, Lamu Mangrove customs, Kenya Ports Authority jetty and Shella jetty. Mr Kioi said security has also been beefed up in all public places, including mosques where Muslims are converging for Idd-ul-Fitr prayers. “We want to ensure our Muslim brothers and sisters celebrate Idd-ul-Fite. We have ensured adequate security measures before, during and even after celebrations. We have enough police officers posted all over the county, on our roads and the far places of Boni Forest, Kiunga and Ishakani border of Lamu and Somalia. We have even increased the number of National Police Reservists in all villages in Lamu. There is no cause for alarm,” said Mr Kioi.   Idd-ul-Fitr celebrations begin countrywide.
