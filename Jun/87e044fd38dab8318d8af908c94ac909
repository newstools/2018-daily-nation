The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has warned the public to be wary of fake employment offer letters. TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia said the letters have names and forged signatures of officers from the commission and cautioned job seekers against being duped. “The commission has information that persons responsible for this illegal activity are soliciting for bribes from unemployed teachers and general public,” said Mrs Macharia in a statement. She explained that TSC recruitment process entails the application for employment against advertised vacancies and subsequently. Selection of candidates is done at TSC offices or by boards of management who are acting as agents of the TSC in case of post primary institution. Mrs Macharia said any letter of offer of employment to a candidate who has not undergone the process is invalid, unenforceable and fake. The commission is hiring 8,672 teachers to support a new government policy to have all primary school leavers enrolled into secondary schools. A total of 7,672 of the new staffers will be appointed in secondary schools while 1,000 will be posted in primary.
