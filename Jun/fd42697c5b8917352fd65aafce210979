The 2006 World Junior 5000m silver medallist Pauline Korikwiang is back. The 30-year-old Kenya Defence Forces officer signalled her return from injuries that had plagued her for over three years, when she won the women's 10,000m title as Athletics Kenya National Championships got underway on Thursday at Kasarani Stadium. Korikwiang engaged the defending champion Alice Aprot (Prisons) in a thrilling mind game in the last seven laps after Nairobi's Sandra Chebet dropped out, before winning in 31 minutes and 51.1 seconds. Aprot, who failed to finish her 10,000m race during the Commonwealth Games trials, also announced her come back to defend her Africa title, finishing second in 31:59.1. Aprot is also the Africa 10,000m champion. Chebet came in third in 32:26.5 as favourite and Commonwealth 10,000m silver medallist Stacy Ndiwa of Police withdrew with eight laps to go. Korikwiang, who last represented Kenya at the 2011 African Games in Maputo where she won bronze in 10,000m and 5,000m, and Aprot, who finished fourth in 10,000m at 2016 Rio Olympic Games and 2017 World Championships, claimed the two automatic tickets to the Africa Senior Athletics Championships due August 1 to 5 in Assaba, Nigeria. Chebet can only wait for the wild card from Athletics Kenya.   "This confirms my return and I thank God having recovered from a nagging hip joint injury," said Korikwiang, the 2006 World Cross Country junior champion. "It feels good to be back and represent Kenya again." Korikwiang, the KDF champion, minced no words to declare her obvious intentions. "I want that African title before going for the World Cup," said Korikwiang. " I am happy to get the ticket to defend my Africa title. It has not been easy to gain form after a break. I will now need to polish on my speed ahead of the Africa Championships " said Aprot. It's in Assaba where the African team for the World Cup that is also known as the Continental Cup will be picked. The World Cup is due for Ostrava Czech in September 8 and 9 this year.   Cheruiyot said he is focused on winning.
