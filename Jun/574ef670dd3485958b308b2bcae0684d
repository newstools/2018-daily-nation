Four schools have been disqualified from the Mombasa County Secondary Schools Term Two Games due to cheating. The Four, three boys' and one girls' school were sent packing by the Mombasa District Secondary Schools Sports Association with mistakes ranging from falsifying documents to fielding over-age students in the under-16 football competition, according to Silas Atsulu, the Mombasa Secondary Schools Sports Association Secretary. According to Atsulu, Shimo La Tewa and St Charles Lwanga Boys' under 16 teams had genuine documents, but ignored the under-16 threshold rules which require that only players born on or after December 1, 2002 participate in the competition. For Mrima Secondary Boys and Concordia Girls' under 16 teams, Atsulu revealed the documents were tampered with, but the schools could not avail the original documents when asked to. “Shimo La Tewa Secondary and St Charles Lwanga simply failed to take note of the age cut of limit, but the other two schools were hell bent to cheat and that’s the reason we kicked them out," Atsulu said. In the absence of three who were disqualified just before the semi-finals matches, Tudor Day took on Frere Town Secondary in the finals and won 2-0 for the title. The under 16 girls' title went to Mama Ngina Girls after Condordia Secondary, whom they were to meet in the finals, were thrown out. Tononoka Secondary retained their under 19 boys' title after beating Khamis High 3-0. They had seen off Bomu Secondary 4-0 in the semis, while Khamis beat Moi Forces 4-3 on post-match penalties. New kids on the block Valerie Macmillan School defeated Kajembe Secondary 2-0 for the girls' under 19 title. Other results saw St Peters School retain the boys’ and girls’ volleyball titles, while St Charles Lwanga Secondary also retained the netball title after beating Kajembe Secondary 32-19.
