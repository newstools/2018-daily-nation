Struggling Tusker have started a midseason clear out at the club with head coach Robert Matano said to be eyeing to rebuild his squad around new players. Nation Sport understands that a number of players have already been sent out on loan while others have been released by the club - which parted ways with 14 experienced players at the end of last season. Among the biggest casualties are Kenyan internationals Edwin Lavatsa, goalkeeper David Okello, defender David Mwangi, winger Paul Odhiambo and Ugandan utility Lawrence Kasadha. Defender Collins Shivachi has been sent out on loan to Kakamega Homeboyz, where he is set to be reunited with former Tusker coach Paul Nkata and ex-brewers Allan Wanga, Noah Wafula and James Situma. Matano, who took over from Sam Timbe just two months into the new season, is said to be growing impatient with the players whom he blasted at the end of their 2-0 loss to Kakamega Homeboyz in their last league outing last weekend. Tusker, who beat Taita Taveta All Stars 7-0 in their SportPesa Shield round of 64 on Sunday in Wundanyi, have lost their last three league matches and face title-chasing Ulinzi Stars on Wednesday at Ruaraka. The brewers are currently flirting with relegation, as they are placed 13th on the 18-team log on 19 points, just five ahead of bottom-placed Sony Sugar.
