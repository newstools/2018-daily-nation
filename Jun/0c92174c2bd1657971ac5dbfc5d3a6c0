The Kenya National Rally Championship resumes with the Rallye Sport Club event next weekend. The last 2018 KNRC round was the Safari Rally, which was held on March 17-18. It was won by Carl Tundo and Tim Jessop in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10. The championship had been halted due to adverse weather conditions. The Kenya Motor Sports Clubâ€™s round of the 2018 Kenya National Rally Championship, which was to be held on the May 12-13, has now been pushed October 13-14. Helen Shiri, the first indigenous African female official to run a major round of the KNRC, will be the Clerk of the Course. "Rains have really played with our minds and plans. We have been on the survey of the route several times. Every time the roads were a no zone area. But we have now come up with a detailed route around Konza and Machakos area," said Shiri. With the help of George Mwangi as the Deputy Clerk of the Course, the pair have compiled a route of up to 208 kilometres of which 176kms will be of competitive distance. Three stages will be done twice. The longest stage will be about 50km.
