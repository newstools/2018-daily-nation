The Kenya Films Classification Board will be the title sponsor of next year’s Kenya National Drama and Film Festival. This was revealed by the board’s Chief Executive Officer Dr Ezekiel Mutua, who said the festival was the best time and place to promote national unity, cohesion as well as instil values to young people. The drama festival is Kenya’s largest event of its kind in East and Central Africa and has helped to discover and nurture talents. It is held at the end of the school first term and next year, Kakamega County will host in April. The intention of the board is to be the title sponsor. Speaking to Nation, Dr Mutua said the board intends to use drama and film to inculcate moral values, teamwork, hard work, discipline and to fight corruption, among other things. MORAL VALUES “Kenya will only progress if moral values are instilled in young people since they are the future of the country. We should start instilling moral values in Kenyans at an early age. This way, they will grow up to be honest and transparent people, and the country will archive growth,” said Dr Mutua. Before the festival, Dr Mutua disclosed KFCB will first sponsor a workshop for script writers later this year, among other production activities. KFCB is especially interested in the growth of the film category of the festival, which is relatively doing very well. POSTERITY The festival officials will be touring the county in June to inspect it’s preparedness for the festival. Dr Mutua said KFCB will carry out proper documentation of the festival’s past editions for posterity. “We should not forget past heroes. That is why we are undertaking this endeavour,” said Dr Mutua. The event features plays, dramatised cultural dances, poems, oral narratives and lately, films.
