The new rules about managing gender relations in girls’ schools have not been properly thought out. Whereas the objective is clearly understood, some of the proposed rules are ill-conceived. They start from the premise that all male teachers are predators and must be kept away from girls they teach. Male teachers are pre-judged unfairly notwithstanding the fact that most of them are highly professional and ethical. VICTIMS True, cases of male teachers preying on school girls have increased going by statistics at the Education ministry. And this trend must be arrested because it portends the single most dangerous threat to girls’ schooling. Learners bestow a lot of trust on their teachers and, therefore, can easily fall victim to amorous and scheming tutors. But that does not mean that all the teachers are evil. Rules guiding relations between teachers and students must be realistic and accord professionals the dignity they deserve. RELATIONS A report we published today presents the challenges that confront male teachers in girls’ schools. They have to strike a delicate balance and keep a professional relationship with the girls – bring them close and provide mentorship but keep a studious distance from them. The teachers ought to understand that they are surrogate parents of the students and have heavy responsibilities and obligations over them. They provide guidance and are expected to be role models. Never should they enter into any illicit liaison with their learners. ETHICS At the same time, learners must be disciplined and made to understand that there is a limit to their relations with teachers. In sum, although the rules are well-intentioned, seeking to protect school girls, they should not be demeaning to teachers. On their part, teachers must uphold professional standards and ethics and desist from immoral practice of enticing students into sexual relationships; and those culpable must be punished severely.
