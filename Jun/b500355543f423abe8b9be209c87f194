Governor Alfred Mutua has expressed confidence that he will win his seat back if the Supreme Court does not quash Court of Appeal’s nullification of his re-election. The Machakos County governor who said he has filed a notice of appeal in the Supreme Court blamed his woes on powerful figures out to end his 2022 presidential ambitions. "I blame my woes on my fight against corruption and agitating for lifestyle audits for top government officials,” said Mr Mutua. Mr Mutua claimed that he has a list of powerful figures involved in the maize scandal and will soon expose them. The Machakos County chief urged President Kenyatta not to relent on his fight against corruption. He was speaking at Kola Ward in Kalama, Machakos Town on Saturday where he was accompanied by his deputy, Francis Maliti. Mr Mutua’s re-election was nullified on Friday by the Court of Appeal.   Wavinya Ndeti wins big at the Court of Appeal.
