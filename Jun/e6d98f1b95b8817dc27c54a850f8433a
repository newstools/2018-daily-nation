The High Court has quashed the decision by Kisii University to close its campus in Kisumu. Judge Fred Ochieng' faulted the university council’s decision to give the more than 1,600 students one day to transfer to the main campus. The university shut its Kisumu campus last month in a memo posted at the institution’s notice board, two days after the new semester began. The move triggered the students to seek legal redress challenging the decision. They argued that they were not consulted before the University Council reached the decision. The students were directed to pick transfer forms to enable them to be transferred to one of the satellite campuses of their choice. The campuses were Kisii University main, Kericho, Eldoret and Migori campuses. It is because of this that drove Justice Ochieng to describe the decision by the council as “shockingly unreasonable” since the nearest campus was some 100 kilometers away from Kisumu. “While the University Council has the discretion to open or to abolish campuses, that discretion ought to be used reasonably and in good faith,” he said. Mr Ochieng also noted that the University did not provide the court with evidence of the audit by the Commission of University Education.
