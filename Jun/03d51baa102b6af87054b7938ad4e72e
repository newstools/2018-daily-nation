Kenya Simbas and Zimbabwe held their final training sessions on Friday at RFUEA grounds in Nairobi ahead of their Rugby Africa Gold Cup cum 2019 World Cup qualifying match. The clash kicks off at 3pm. Zimbabwe Sables coach Peter de Villiers took the visitors through their paces as they geared up to play against long-time rivals. Zimbabwe arrived in Nairobi on Wednesday while Kenya Simbas returned on Monday morning from their successful outing in Casablanca where they downed their Moroccan host 28-24 to draw first blood in the tournament. Sables assistant coach Brendan Dawson was optimistic of getting a result in Nairobi. "Our team is fully fit. We have no injuries at the moment we are very happy with our preparation and we are ready for Saturday." Zimbabwe drew 23-23 with Morocco in their first 2018 Gold Cup outing. "Kenya are aggressive and active in the field. â€œThey run the ball really wide; it's the way Kenya always play and we expect a high tempo game." "The Kenya Simbas coach has been involved with the team for a very short period of time, so I am not so sure of the amount of changes he can bring. But it's the same Kenya, quite competitive side, big men who have rugby sevens influence so we expect the side we've seen over the last few years." Brandon was in-charge of the Zimbabwean side that beat Kenya Simbas in 2012 in Nairobi to win the Africa Gold Cup but said the addition of World Cup qualification did not add any pressure to them. Zimbabwe named their starting squad to play Kenya Friday morning with prop Denford Mutamangira set to captain the side. "It's exactly the same. We want to qualify for the World Cup pressure is on us (Africa), the standards in the rest World is improving day by day so we need to keep up with the modern pressure and pace of the game. Yes, pressure is here; let's say a bit of it but we want to qualify for the World Cup like everyone else." Of the 25 Zimbabwe players who travelled to Nairobi, only Lucky Sithole and Ziyanda Khupe do not make the match-day 23 named by Peter de Villiers. Kenya Simbas head coach Ian Snook said his squad was looking good ahead of the match although he insisted on focusing on line-outs and breakdowns. "Obviously we've watched video of their game against Morocco we realise there will be a big test. It will be difficult." "We are looking to improve on line-outs and set-pieces also a little bit of scrummaging. We've been working on that. Otherwise the mood is positive and we are ready to go on Saturday afternoon."
