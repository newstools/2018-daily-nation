Eldama Ravine MP Moses Lessonet is seeking Sh10 million from former lawmaker Musa Sirma after he won an election petition. The MP wants the High Court and the Court of Appeal to slap Mr Sirma with the amount as costs for suits before them. Mr Sirma had filed a petition before the Kabarnet High Court challenging the election of Mr Lessonet on September 6, last year. He later lost the appeal case. Mr Lessonet is now seeking Sh3.1million and Sh6.9 million for the High Court and Court of Appeal cases respectively.
