Nyeri County employees are required to sign a code of conduct as the war against corruption in the country intensifies. In a gazette notice published on May 31, the staff should sign the document within 30 days. Governor Mutahi Kahiga urged Kenyans to support President Uhuru Kenyatta’s anti-graft slugfest. VETTING Mr Kahiga said the employees will undergo lifestyle audits and vetting. "Our code of conduct was derived from the Constitution and it resonates well with the President’s message against corruption. "We have continued to insist that all county officials must work within the limiters of accountability and transparency," Mr Kahiga said. The employees are also prohibited from opening or operating bank accounts outside the country without the approval of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). INTEGRITY The notice signed by County Secretary Benjamin Gachichio warns the staff against a host of issues such as cronyism, nepotism and illegal enrichment. "An officer shall not in any way trade with County Government of Nyeri or allow his spouse or relatives to do so or trade with any other institution where he is likely to have an advantage by virtue of his office," the code warns. Mr Gachichio also warned the staff against knowingly giving false or misleading information to the public or falsifying documents. "An officer who is serving on a full-time basis is prohibited from engaging in any other gainful employment which results in the impairment of the officer or in the execution of the functions of his/her office or results in a conflict of interest," the notice cautions. Those who contravene the Code of Conduct and Ethics will be investigated by the County Public Service Board or any other relevant government agency.
