A man is on the run after allegedly defiling his 14-year-old daughter at their home in Kipturo village, Muhoroni in Kisumu County. While Muhoroni OCPD Mohammed Jarso denied knowledge of the incident, Nation has established that the matter was reported at Muhoroni Police Post under OB number 13/12/6/2018. According to Muhoroni Community Policing chairman, Mr Francis Owuor, the suspect, has been living with the minor after separating from her mother more than 12 years ago. “We suspect that the man had committed the crime for a long period of time before his beastly activities were brought to light,” he said. Mr Owuor said it was her teacher who noticed the girl’s change in walking style, raising suspicion something was amiss. Upon examination, she discovered that the girl had marks on her thighs inflicted by a sharp object. “The girl said that the father [routinely] used a razor blade or a knife to threaten her and scratch her thighs when she resisted his advances,” he said. HIDING The suspect, who disappeared after being informed angry villagers were baying for his blood, is said to be hiding in a nearby sugarcane plantation. “We have information that the man is still in the area and is sometimes seen late in the night when people are asleep,” said the suspect's younger brother. Villagers claim the man has had a series of young wives. A medical officer at Muhoroni Sub County Hospital where the girl was taken said she is in stable condition. The girl has been taken to an orphanage in Muhoroni.
