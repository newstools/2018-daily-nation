Public Health officers and the police in Busia on Thursday seized a truckload of contaminated milk that was destined for the Kenyan market from Uganda. The truck with Uganda registration numbers was impounded by the officers as it was offloading the commodity in one of the milk outlets in the border town at around 4pm, Busia Public Health Officer Wilfred Magoba said. The official said, although the expiry date on the cartons were valid, the milk was confiscated because it was contaminated. “The truck transporting the milk is rusty and some boxes are torn, pouring out some mild,” he said. Busia and the Western part of the country is the lead market for different milk brands from Uganda that are competing to meet the high demand for the commodity widely used by both low and high income households. A carton of milk, containing 12 packets, fetches for as low as Sh350. The border town has over 100 milk vendors but the demand for product has been on the increase taking advantage few local dairies in the region.
