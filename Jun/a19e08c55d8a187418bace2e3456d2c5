Four  people died in a road accident yesterday when a lorry carrying fertilizer collided with a matatu at Kariene in Central Imenti, Meru County. Seven other people, including a baby, sustained injuries and are admitted to Meru Level Five hospital and Kariene hospitals. The baby’s mother was among the two women and two men who died in the 1.45pm crash. Meru police boss David Kirui   said the lorry was heading to Meru and the matatu, to Nkubu. Police are yet to determine what may have caused the grisly crash. “So far, we have not established the cause of the accident and also to confirm the number of occupants of the two vehicles. Investigations are going on,” Mr Kirui said. The police boss asked drivers to be vigilant when approaching road curves. “Drivers should be very cautious as the roads may be slippery, especially during this rainy season,” he said.
