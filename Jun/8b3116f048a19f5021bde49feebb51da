Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has finally apologized to pupils of Tharua Primary School whom he reprimanded for requesting toilets for their school. Mr Ndiritu made the apology on Tuesday after he was widely criticised for his actions. Already, works have started at the school for construction of 10 toilets following an online campaign which targets to raise Sh350,000. “This morning we sent a team to the school to start digging the pit. We plan to have the toilets ready for use in the next two weeks,” said the coordinator of the initiative Mr Muturi Kimondo. Mr Kimondo said they are still receiving donations and have already got Sh50,000 from Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria. The county governor called a press conference on Tuesday in Nanyuki town to apologise for having grabbed the microphone from the pupils who were presenting the petition through a song. Mr Ndiritu apparently ordered the pupils back to class “We unreservedly apologise to the children. The county education board will visit the school and we want to encourage all stakeholders to use this unfortunate circumstance as a learning point,” he said during the press conference.
