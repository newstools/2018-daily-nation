While it is true that the problem of alcohol abuse in Kiambu County and other parts of the country is rampant, the solution lies in well-coordinated programmes involving health professionals, counsellors and other professionals. Administrators need to monitor the alcohol business and enforce the law, besides ensuring that dealers and consumers adhere to stringent rules and regulations. However, it's quite unlikely that such officials would have the expertise to singlehandedly come up with rehabilitation programmes for such addicts. The best they can do is register their concern and seek expert advice on what needs to be done. It's for this reason that questions are being raised about an experiment by Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, in which alcoholics are reportedly being paid some money in the hope that they will quit drinking. The intention may be good but that cannot be a justification for profligacy. It is imperative that any decision involving the use of public money be subjected to wide consultations for expert inputs so that the merits and demerits of such a scheme can be evaluated before it is implemented. In the spirit of good governance, public participation in determining the usage of public funds is vital for accountability. The counties have, since their inception, become effective vehicles for development at the grassroots. However, they also have been found to be avenues for wanton wastage of public resources through corruption and unjustified expenditure. Where the leaders come up with their own schemes, through which public funds are squandered, they must be held to account and surcharged to recover the money.
