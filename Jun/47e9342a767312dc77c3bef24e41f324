Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has said he would not relent in his pursuit for a review of the county’s border with Kisumu. He said this is one way to solve historical injustices meted on his community during the colonial period. During the Madaraka Day celebrations at Nandi Hills Stadium, Mr Sang said they had agreed to pursue the matter legally promising to ensure that no one will be displaced if the boundary was to be redrawn as per their wish. "I want to assure all the communities including the Luo community on the border that they would not be displaced," he said. The county is claiming key towns that are presently in Kisumu saying the boundary should be extended to put them under Nandi. The towns include Chemelil, Muhoroni, Kibigori and Miwani, all under Kisumu administration. The governor said that talks have been going with his Kisumu counterpart Anyang’ Nyong’o. "I want to ask Prof Nyongo to present his petition as well to the National Land Commission because we already have ours, Nandi County has suffered greatly because of this injustice the past 50years," he said. Kisumu leaders recently asked Mr Sang to stop raising tension along the volatile border through the boundary review petition. Muhoroni MP Onyango K’oyoo said Mr Sang should be investigated for his plans to encroach into Kisumu. His Kisumu East counterpart Shakeel Shabbir warned that the move may open a Pandora’s Box on various boundary rows across the country.
