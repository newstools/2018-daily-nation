A school in Igembe South in Meru county has been closed indefinitely by public health officials over lack of toilets. Igembe South health director, Ntoitha Baimirongo, closed Athimba Primary School because pupils have been forced to relieve themselves in nearby maize and miraa farms. Mr Baimirongo ordered the school, which has 1,020 pupils and 24 teachers to construct pit latrines, a urinal trough and handwashing facilities. “The school will remain closed until compliance is achieved to avert disease outbreak,” Mr Baimirongo. Several weeks ago, Meru Maendeleo ya Wanawake Chairperson Mary Kanana urged residents to dig more pit latrines in the area, saying many rural households do not have not toilets. “I urge residents to dig pit latrines to avoid waste being carried to the rivers. We don’t want to hear cases of waterborne diseases here in Meru,” said Ms Kanana.
