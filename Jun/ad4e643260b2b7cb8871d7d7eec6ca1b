The spat between the government and the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) after Kenya Sevens players concealed Brand Kenya messages on their jerseys during Paris Sevens last weekend isnâ€™t healthy for the game. This is happening at a time when the 2017/2018 World Rugby Sevens Series has just ended, paving way for the Rugby World Cup Sevens planned for July 20-22 this year in San Francisco, USA. Kenya Sevens players might have agreed with Brand Kenya to some money owing to their ambassadorial duties but they ended up not getting the cash because of an overdraft KRU had with their bank. That is what caused the embarrassing situation in Paris. Kenya Sevens finished eighth overall in the World Rugby Sevens Series after surpassing the 100 points mark for the first time ever. This is the momentum that should be upheld going into the World Cup. Kenya Sevens has reached the semi-finals in the past two editions. Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa said he would summon KRU to explain the Paris debacle but KRU chairman Richard Omwela indicated that they are running on deficit after the government remitted only Sh31 million out of the Sh124 mil-lion sponsorship pledge for the season. The row has once again brought to the fore the difficulties sports federations are going through while sourcing for sponsorship. It also underlines the incompetence by sports federations in marketing their products to attract good sponsorship. A lasting solution has to be found for sports funding in the country. While the ministry needs to put sports lottery into operation so as to ensure full funding, sports federations too need to wake up and put in place the right mechanisms and marketing strategies to raise funds.
