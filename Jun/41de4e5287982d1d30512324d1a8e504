It was another heart in mouth moment for Mrs. Michael Spencer's, Free Wheeler (Lesley Sercombe), as it made the torturous Royal Artillery St. Leger journey of 2,800m on Sunday. Quite tiring for the best three-year-old in Kenya, who has accommodated every distance in his short career. What a Pegasus to own. Full hats off to trainer, Patsy Sercombe, for keeping the constantly keen colt, up to his various tasks, and, for serving us another treble - Soho Mouse, and, Fast Five. Wakini Ndegwa had a fun day, with her Stormchild and Galileo, dead-heating in the Legibra Maiden. Then, a quick double from Ione in the Almasi Capital Handicap. Nothing quite like a false start to spice a twist of interest. This was how the Warren Veasey JCK November Rose Bowl panned out. Eventually, jockeys were able to stop their steeds from running full flight away. As Paragon (Patrick Mungai), seized the moment upon return, by zipping along from pillar to post, for Runye Karlsen, Stewart McCann, Elsa/Romolo Severini, and, P. Anjana.
