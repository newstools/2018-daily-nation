The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji has revealed there are 508 corruption cases involving 1,462 accused persons his office has filed since 2013 which are estimated at a total value of Sh60 billion. Mr Haji said 256 of the cases are ongoing with 72 of them involving senior government officials. In a report to the committee on Justice and Legal Affairs of the National Assembly, Mr Haji revealed that 17 of the cases involve Cabinet Secretaries and Principal Secretaries, two involve governors, five involve Members of Parliament, 15 involve senior county officials and 33 concern senior national government officials. CASES ONGOING “The cases are currently ongoing. They are at various stages of hearing in court and involve approximately Sh60 billion,” he said during a meeting between the committee, the ODPP and Ethics and Anti-Corruption commission. Mr Haji rejected claims that the two institutions have been working at cross purposes and that investigations into graft have been compromised, leaving the main perpetrators to walk away scot-free. “The two institutions have been sensitised on guidelines for prosecution of corruption cases and regularly conduct workshops that involve all players in the criminal justice system,” he said.
