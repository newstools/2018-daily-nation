Britain is set to leave the European Union on Friday at exactly 11:00 pm. It is a development that will invalidate the laws that existed since 1973, the year the country belatedly joined a body that had started its formative years as early as 1950 as the Coal and Steel Community. Just as its exit, the entry of Britain into the European Club was preceded by a lengthy debate. This time round, however, that is likely to last longer as there are many consequences of ‘Brexit’ as regards trade, jobs and movement of goods and services. ULTIMATE LOSER The EU is now a bloc with a population of 508 million distributed among 28 countries. Britain’s exit cuts it by 65 million. There are many questions though. Who will be the ultimate loser from the Brexit divorce? Is it the United Kingdom or the other 27 EU nations? There have even been calls for the Brexit vote to be repeated and signatures were collected for the purpose. One of the main sticking issues over the years has been Britain’s refusal to embrace the union’s single borders policy under the Schengen Accords. At the same time, the UK also rejected the EU’s single currency policy under the euro. FORMER COLONIES Being a top European nation, especially in defence, and having liberated most of the countries that now comprise the EU, Britain’s departure is a major blow to the union. At the same time, Britain may find itself the biggest loser, especially if its trade with the EU is curtailed. In Africa, it means the UK will deal directly with its former colonies and other partners and not through the EU. However, a lot will depend on how British PM Theresa May outlines her Brexit plans in a blueprint she is due to issue shortly on trade, customs and movement of persons.
