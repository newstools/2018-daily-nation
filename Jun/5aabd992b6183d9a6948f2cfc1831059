With 26 people having succumbed to Rift Valley Fever, a disease that ravages animals and humans, the authorities must move faster to stem the spread of the epidemic. It is, therefore, quite disappointing to note that the situation has reportedly been worsened by a severe shortage of essential vaccines at the Kenya Veterinary Vaccine Production Institute. While this explanation makes a bit of sense as there could be some unavoidable factors that might have led to the failure to produce the vaccines, these preventable deaths of Kenyans are totally unacceptable. Surely, if the local institute is unable to make the drugs, then the public health authorities should have thought of alternative sources, even if it means importing the vaccines. EMERGENCY OPERATION The manager of an emergency operation centre in the Ministry of Health, while acknowledging that the available stocks are grossly inadequate, says he cannot rule out further deaths in Wajir, Marsabit and adjacent counties. This emergency centre should, instead, have been updating us on the rapid response being mobilised. It is the responsibility of the government to protect the citizens from disease and any other threats. And with the vast resources at the disposal of the Health and Agriculture ministries, which are directly responsible in this case, specialised teams must be immediately sent to the affected areas to deal with this threat. VACCINE SHORTAGE This is not the time for blame games on why there is a vaccine shortage. The authorities must demonstrate that all Kenyans deserve quick and adequate assistance in case of an epidemic or disaster, irrespective of how remote their location is. The last thing we would wish to hear is that the deaths from the raging zoonotic disease in the north have occurred because itâ€™s far from the capital. The lacklustre response to this epidemic is a grave indictment of our national disaster preparedness and response.
