The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has finally gazetted the names of 71 teachers who have been kicked out of the teaching service for various reasons. The 71 teachers are all male and will not be allowed to teach anywhere in the country including in private schools. The sacking of the teachers comes in the wake of a defilement incident at Moi Girls School in Nairobi last week and which has seen TSC warn schools against recruiting any person to handle students who is not registered by the commission. The sacked teachers had pending cases from 2016 to 2018. The teachers are accused of deserting duty, having sexual relations with their students – which makes up the majority of the cases – insubordination, negligence among others. The newly deregistered teachers join list of other 40 male teachers who were kicked out in January. In 2016, 22 teachers who had sexual relations with their students were banned from ever teaching in Kenya while in 2015, another 126 teachers were deregistered. “Further, it is notified for general information that pursuant to Sections 30 (4) & (5), 23 (2) of the Act: Where the name of a teacher is removed from the register of teachers, such a person shall not be reinstated except by direction of the commission,” said TSC CEO Nancy Macharia in the Friday’s gazette notice. She went on: “A teacher whose name has been removed from the register shall cease to be a teacher for purposes of this Act with effect from the date of such removal.”
