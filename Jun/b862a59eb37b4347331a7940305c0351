MOSCOW Russia's Iury Gazinsky scored the first goal of the 2018 World Cup on Thursday as the host nation took a 1-0 lead against Saudi Arabia in the opening match of the tournament. Gazinsky headed into the net in the 12th minute at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, sparking scenes of delight from the home crowd.   Russia started on top in Moscow, but the goal came from the first effort on target of the match. It was also a landmark moment for Gazinskiy as it was his first international goal for Russia. However, there was a blow for Russia mid-way through the first half as star playmaker Alan Dzagoev limped off. Dzagoev appeared to pull a hamstring off the ball and could be a doubt for the rest of the tournament.
