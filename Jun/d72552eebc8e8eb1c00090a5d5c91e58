Hi Brenda, There is a guy at work sending me pictures of his genitals and I'm tempted to give in, purely for the physical, but I think he might look at me funny after, you know? I'm resigning in a month anyway, so I'm thinking he can scratch an itch that's been bothering me for a while. What do you think?  I think that you can find someone else to scratch your itch, to be honest. My first reaction would definitely be don't defecate where you eat, simply because that always leads to unnecessary complications – if he is a person whose station at work is higher than yours, he could jeopardise your work, even if it's just a month to go. But, if you have already handed in your resignation letter, and weighed his maturity against your itch (i.e. It won’t show up someday on the work WhatsApp group or something), and you've checked your HR policies about work relationships and are willing to risk whatever penalties they have, then have at it. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? E-mail: lifeanstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I find myself struggling to remain committed to him.
