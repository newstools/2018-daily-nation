Police have arrested a woman in Gacharaigu village in Murang’a County for allegedly stabbing her husband to death following a domestic row. Mr Julius Njuguna, 25, died at the Murang’a County Referral Hospital of stab wounds allegedly inflicted on him by his 22-year-old wife Dorcas Waigwe. “A relative of the couple reported to us that he heard commotion from Mr Njuguna’s home and when he arrived he found him lying in a pool of blood. “He looked for a taxi and together with Mr Njuguna’s wife and rushed him to hospital where he died while undergoing treatment,” Kangema DCIO Peter Wahome said. Mr Wahome said they have arrested the suspect for questioning and will arraign her on Monday. It was after taking Mr Njuguna to hospital that the relative reported the incident to Murang’a Police Station, leading to the woman’s arrest. The relative told the Nation that the incident happened at about 10pm on Friday and was first informed that the couple was quarrelling by his nephew. “They have been quarrelling from time to time but I did not think it would reach this far. It’s so unfortunate and hope our family will get justice,” he said.
