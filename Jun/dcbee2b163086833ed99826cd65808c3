Kilifi Deputy OCPD Peter Mutuma said they were trying to overtake another truck on the Mavueni-Kaloleni road. "The four people who belong to the same family were travelling to Kilifi when the accident occurred and their bodies were taken to Kilifi sub-county hospital mortuary awaiting post-mortem," he said. Mr Tony Dadi, a relative, said he lost his sister, niece and mother. The mother was being taken to a dispensary. "All of them including the rider are relatives and it is a very sad day for us," Mr Dadi said.
