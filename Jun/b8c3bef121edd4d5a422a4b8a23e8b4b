One person has been killed and several injured after herders clashed in Wajir over pasture. Wajir South Deputy County Commissioner Felix Kisalu said the herders clashed on Saturday over water and pasture at Ibrahim Ure. “The two clans who clashed on Saturday have been living peacefully for many years and for now we are treating it as an isolated incident,” Mr Kisalu said. A team of elders and security officers quickly moved to engage the warring herders in bid to resolve the conflict. Unconfirmed report indicates that several residents from the area where the attack occurred have started moving over fear of retaliatory attacks.
