Bar owners in Migori County spent Madaraka Day in police cells over the sale of illegal alcohol. The joint raid conducted by Kenya Revenue Authority, police and the National Authority for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse (Nacada) targeted those selling beer smuggled in from Tanzanian. The officers stormed entertainment joints in Ntimaru, Kegonga, Senta, Kwiriba, Kehancha and Isebania. REVENUE KRA Nyanza Region Coordinator Kelvin Safari had said that smuggling makes the government lose revenue. "We will continue with the crackdown in order to stamp out this dirty business as KRA loses a lot of revenue as a result of unscrupulous traders smuggling goods into the country," Mr Safari said recently. County Commissioner Joseph Rotich on Thursday last week said police will step up efforts to end smuggling at the Isebania border. "We are sounding a warning to those people engaged in illegal importation of goods from Tanzania to stop as we are soon closing in on them," Mr Rotich said. CHEAP Tanzanian beer is very cheap compared to local ones. "We rarely sell Kenyan beer because it is expensive compared to Bongo beer(Tanzanian beer). Many of our customers like the beer because it is cheap and not refined, hence they get drunk faster than when they take Kenyan beer," a bar owner at Kegonga town said. For example, Balimi (which is the cheapest) goes for Sh60 while Tusker is sold for Sh150. Kehancha resident Jacob Mwita said: "Tanzanian beer has made life here easier. With Sh500, I am assured of a good time as I know I will drink to my fill. I cannot buy Kenyan beer." The common smuggling routes are Gwitembe, Masangora and Isebania.
