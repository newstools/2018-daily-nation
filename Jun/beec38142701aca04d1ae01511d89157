Football Kenya Federation has parted ways with technical director of national football teams, Andreas Spiers. FKF president Nick Mwendwa made the announcement Monday on the sidelines of a national football symposium in Nairobi. Mwendwa added the federation will not renew the German coach’s two-year contract upon expiry next month, hinting that the decision may have been influenced by the recent recruitment of Frenchman Sebastian Migne as Harambee Stars coach. “We have challenges on the financial front and it was decided that we part ways. We are happy with his work for the time he has been here and wish him well,” said Mwendwa. Spiers signed a two-year contract with FKF in 2016 and was tasked with setting up Under-13 and Under-15 national teams, as well as to identify a style of play suitable for Kenyan footballers. “I ask for patience because nothing can be done on the short term. I have a number of targets but this will take time. I intend to evaluate the system so that we can find a suitable and agreeable style of play that the players can identify with. I will not impose any philosophy, even though I prefer the German style of play,” Spiers said during his unveiling in 2016. During his stint in Kenya, Spiers who has previously managed the Rwanda women’s football team, was spotted scouting young payers at tournaments. He also took charge of the Under-17 national team at international assignments without notable success. Nation Sport understands Spiers has already left the country.
