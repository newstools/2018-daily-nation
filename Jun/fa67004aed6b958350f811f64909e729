More than 20 schools in Wajir County are yet to get new tutors from the Teachers Service Commission new hires meant to replace those who fled the area over security concerns. Several teachers fled the county after suspected Al-shabaab militants attacked Qarsa Primary School, killing two teachers and a tutor’s wife. The exodus led to a crisis that almost crippled education in various schools in the county prompting the Teachers Service Commission to advertise vacant teaching posts. However, the Nation has established that despite the new hires some schools are yet to get tutors to replace those who left. Schools in Tarbaj and Wajir East rural are worst-hit. In an interview with the Nation, Wajir County Knut secretary Noor Bardad said that out of 27 primary schools in Tarbaj, only 10 have received new teachers. Some of the schools affected include Khorof Kharar, Kutulo, Wajir Bor among others. “All of the above areas have both the Administration Police and regular police camps and I am wondering why the teachers were not send there yet their security is assured security,” he asked.   Equitable sharing of county resources and fairness will be a key pillar in our administration.
