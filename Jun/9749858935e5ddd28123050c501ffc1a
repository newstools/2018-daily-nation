Grief engulfed Gitumbi village in Kithimu, Embu County Wednesday morning after a 93-year-old grandmother was found raped and murdered inside her house. The naked body of the elderly woman was found by her granddaughter, Josphine Muthoni, who had gone to check on her. Ms Muthoni said she was shocked to find the door to the house was broken and on entering found her grandmother sprawled on the bed. Kithimu assistant chief James Nyaga, who was among the first officials to visit the scene, decried a surge in criminal activities in the area. Two weeks ago, an eight-year-old schoolgirl was raped and murdered in the same area. The assailant remains unknown. Last week, Embu Commissioner Esther Maina said cases of rape and defilement were on the rise in the county and urged residents to cooperate with security officers to nab the criminals. She said police had intensified patrols and at the same time cautioned families and chiefs against allowing settling of defilement cases at homes.
