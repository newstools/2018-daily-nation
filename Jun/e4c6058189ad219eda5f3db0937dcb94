The gang attacked the Thika home of Dr Kagimbi Kimani, who works at the Murang'a Level Four Hospital, at 2am. PANIC The unknown armed men struck and attacked the couple as Dr Kimani returned to his residence at Ngoingwa Estate in Thika town. The medic is fighting for his life at Thika Level Five Hospital after he sustained serious injuries while the body of his wife has been taken to Thika mortuary. According to Murang'a County Health Executive Joseph Mbai, Dr Kagimbi is one of his best doctors in the region and the incident has caused panic and confusion in the medical fraternity. The case, he said, has been reported to police who have initiated investigations. "We hope the perpetrators of the heinous act will be apprehended and charged in court," Mr Mbai told the Nation. Following the attack, doctors in Murang'a, through the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Union (KMPDU), said their security has been compromised both in hospitals and in their living quarters. RAID Dr David Waweru, the KMPDU Muranga branch chairperson, said their calls for increased security have been ignored. According to Dr Waweru, the county government pledged to fence Maragua Hospital after robbers invaded it two months ago but that has not been done. "We were promised by the health officials that fencing would be done and that doctors in night shift would be escorted to their homes," he said. "However, it has never happened and we don't know who will be the next victim. " He said female doctors are traumatised following the attack on Dr Kagimbi since they go home unescorted after night shifts. "We won't mind if the government finds it good to negotiate for our bodyguards since doctors play a very important role to patients," he said.
