Businessman Jimi Wanjigi has written to Inspector- General Joseph Boinnet claiming that police are planning to frame him in fresh criminal charges of dealing with illegal firearms. Through a team of six lawyers led by Siaya Senator James Orengo, the businessman says there are plans to raid his homes and dump illegal guns. In a letter dated June 5, the lawyers indicate that the plan is to continue criminally profiling Mr Wanjigi, who is already facing charges of illegal possession of firearms at a Nyeri court. They claim that police want to profile the businessman as a person of criminal disposition, “through filing of frivolous charges against him in several courts spread across Kenya with a view to hounding and harassing him”. “Part of the nefarious plan is to dump illegal guns in property associated with him or persons associated with him, with a view to accusing him of having an illegal cache of weapons,” reads the two-page letter seen by the Nation. The letter was also sent to Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji and National Police Service Commission. It is signed by Mr Orengo together with lawyers Nelson Havi, Julie Soweto, Willis Otieno, Kiogora Mugambi and Jackson Awele. The lawyers said Mr Wanjigi does not own or possess illegal weapons and that all guns that have been in his possession were lawfully acquired in compliance with the laws of Kenya. They want Mr Boinnet to direct the officers to cancel the alleged plan, arguing that the aim is to harass and besmirch the character of Mr Wanjigi. “We shall take all the necessary measures to protect and defend him from the intended and ongoing illegal acts your officers are pursuing against him,” stated the lawyers. The lawyers added that Mr Wanjigi will sue the officers involved in the alleged plot, saying it amounts to abuse of office and criminal justice system. Last year in October, police  raided Mr Wanjigi’s home in Muthaiga, Nairobi, and confiscated his firearms.
