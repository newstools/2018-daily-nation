The 2015 World javelin champion Julius Yego of Police announced his return to form when he hauled a season’s best 80.91 metres to win the event at the Kenya Championships at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Friday. The victory earned him a ticket to the Africa Senior Athletics Championships where he will be gunning for his third continental title. Little known Vincent Rono (South Rift) and 2014 Africa 10,000m bronze medallist Josphat Bett (Police) also outclassed their rivals to book men’s 10,000m tickets for the African event. Undisputed Kenya women’s 20km race walk champion Grace Wanjiru of Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) is in line for a record seventh consecutive Africa title after she retained her national title in 1 hour, 33 minutes and 01 seconds. Emily Ngii (KDF) settled for second spot in 1:34.35 to also qualify for the African championships due on August 1 to 5 in Assaba, Nigeria.Dominic Abuda (KDF) heaved 62.45m to win the men’s hammer throw. The throw was an improvement of his national record of 61.38m set at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games on April 8 but it was not ratified as he made his effort with the safety of a cage enclosure. Police’s Rose Rakamba threw 53.78m to win women’s hammer throw. KDF and Police protested about the lack of a cage in the hammer competition. Meanwhile, the eagerly awaited 1,500m grand battle between World and Commonwealth champion Elijah Manangoi and training mate Timothy Cheruiyot on the final day today will not take place after all. Manangoi will not participate after he lost his sister Bena on Thursday morning. Cheruiyot, the World and Commonwealth 1,500m silver medallist is now favourite to carry the day. Yego, who had competed in seven events this season for his best throw of 80.75m for sixth place in Doha on May 4, beat 2016 Africa javelin bronze medallist Alex Kiprotich (KDF) to second place (76.48). Kiprotich also qualified for the Africa event as Sammy Keskeny (KDF) settled for third spot with an effort of 68.89. “My nagging groin injury recurred during the World Championships last year and this year’s Commonwealth but everything is okay now,” said Yego, who is also the 2012 and 2014 African champion. “I am happy to have regained my form and what I am polishing on is technique, speed and reaction,” said Yego, the 2014 Commonwealth champion. Back to men’s 10,000m battle, it’s South Rift’s Rono, who was crowned the Kenya 10,000m champion during the trials for the continental event when he broke away from Bett in the scattered field to win in 28:17.24 minutes. Rono, who is excited to represent Kenya for the second time after finishing seventh during the World Cross Country Championships last year in Uganda, edged out Bett, the 2014 Commonwealth 10,000m silver medallist, to second place in 28:24.85 as Kipsang Temoi finished third in 28:29.55. Rono, who finished fourth in his marathon debut in Daegu before winning Lille Half Marathon in France last year, said he had trained well for the race. “It feels great to make the Kenya team for the second time. I will compete in one half marathon race if I will be allowed before seeking African glory. I want a top podium finish after the World Cross disappointment last year,” said the 27-year-old Rono, who trains in Bomet.
