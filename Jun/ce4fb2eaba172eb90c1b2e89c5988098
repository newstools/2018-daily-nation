Residents from Argane area in Wajir County have begun fleeing from the area after herders clashed on Saturday which resulted in death of one person. The herders are said to have clashed over water and pasture in Ibrahim Ure ward in Wajir South. According to reports, a group of residents attacked herders from Wajir East who had moved into the area during the drought period in what they termed as invasion of their land. The area residents began vacating from the area on Sunday as fears mount over reprisal attacks. In an earlier interview with the Nation, Wajir South Deputy County Commissioner Felix Kisalu said that they were currently treating the attack as an isolated incident since the two communities have lived for years without clashing. SECURITY TEAM A security team led by Wajir County Commissioner, Mr Loyford Kibaara, on Monday toured the area to assess the situation and to resolve the conflict. Mr Kibaara was accompanied by elders and religious leaders. A section of residents had accused some elders of fanning hate and fuelling the fights. Several residents took to social media where they criticised the elders for having a hand in renewed fights among the communities. They also called on the government to crack the whip on the individuals suspected to be behind the clashes.   Wajir South administrator says herders clashed over pasture and water.
