Nairobi County Assembly will not vet and approve Governor Mike Sonko’s deputy nominee Miguna Miguna. The county Speaker Beatrice Elachi rejected Mr Miguna’s name because he holds dual citizenship contrary to Article 78 of the Constitution. “Pursuant to Standing Order number one of the Assembly, the name of the nominee be referred back to the appointing authority for further validation,” said Ms Elachi. The Speaker also said that other required documents, including certificate of good conduct, Higher Education Loans Board clearance certificate and Kenya Revenue Authority compliance certificate, were not provided. Ms Elachi's decision may be a relief for the deportee who said Mr Sonko did not consult him prior to the nomination. The Nairobi County boss took many Kenyans by surprise when he named his sharp-tongued critic to be his deputy on May 17. The deputy governor's post fell vacant after Polycarp Igathe resigned on January 12, saying he could not work effectively because he had failed to earn Mr Sonko's trust.
