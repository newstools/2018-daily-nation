PARIS Uefa have closed their financial fair-play case against Paris Saint-Germain after the Qatari-backed French Ligue 1 champions were cleared of any wrongdoing on Wednesday. The Uefa Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) had been monitoring PSG's 'break-even requirement' for 2015, 2016 and 2017. "Compliance with the break-even requirement for the 2018 financial year will remain under close scrutiny," Uefa said. Uefa opened an investigation into PSG's compliance with FFP rules at the start of this season, just weeks after they completed deals to sign Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Neymar arrived for a world-record fee of 222 million euros ($264 million, Sh26.4 billion) from Barcelona, while the club also signed Mbappe on loan from Monaco but with an agreement to sign the teen sensation in a 180 million-euro deal at the end of this campaign.
