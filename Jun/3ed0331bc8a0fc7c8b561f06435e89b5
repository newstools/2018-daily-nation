Police in Migori have arrested a woman with bhang worth Sh500,000. The woman was arrested aboard a matatu that was heading to Migori from Isibania town and taken to Migori Police Station awaiting arraignment. Migori OCPD Patrick King'ori said the drugs, estimated to be around 20kg, were concealed in cartons as foodstuffs. "The bhang was en route to Kisii where it would have been transported to Nairobi," said Mr King'ori. At the roadblock where police nabbed the woman, the matatu driver and his conductor ran away leaving their passengers in the vehicle. After the vehicle was taken to the police station, a woman who claimed to be the vehicle's owner and identified as Moraa, caused a scene when she broke down in front of the officers saying she had bought the matatu on loan. “Why have you increased the quantity of drugs in the vehicle? This is too much, do you want to kill me?” she protested. Police her too to assist them trace the driver and conductor who escaped at the roadblock.
