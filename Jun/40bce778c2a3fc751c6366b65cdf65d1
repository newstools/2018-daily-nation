Despite double-bogeying the par five-fourth and three putting the 14th, Golf Park’s David Wakhu still managed to beat Vet Lab’s Mathew Omondi by two shot to win the third leg of the “Road to Karen’’ series at Muthaiga Golf Club on Wednesday. Starting with two pars and a birdie at the third, Wakhu hit a low approach shot past the green then three putted for a seven. He recovered one at the par three-fifth, but dropped shots at the sixth and ninth, three putted the 14th, though closed with a birdie at the 18th for two over par 73 and a total of one over par 214. “My game is heading where I want though today I missed six greens on regulation, with a three putt at the 14th, but I just need to keep pushing hard to get under par more often," said Wakhu, who said some few gym work has also helped him a great deal. On the other hand, Omondi made six birdies for the day though three bogeys on the first and second and one at the 13th could only leave him with three under par 68 for the day and a three rounds total of 216 to finish second. In third place was the long-hitting Dismas Indiza, who shot one over par 72 for a total of 217. He dropped a shot at the first hole and made a double at the sixth, though he was able to recover two shots at the 15th and 18th. Action now switches to Karen on June 24 for the fourth leg of the series, where the top 25 players will be joined the exempted players for the 2018 Karen Masters set for July 19 at Karen Country Club. Meanwhile, the Sunshine Tour-sanctioned Karen Masters being sponsored by KCB was officially launched on Wednesday at Karen Country Club, where KCB Bank’s Human Resources Director Paul Russo handed the sponsorship cheque of Sh12 million to tournament director Andy Watt and Karen chairman Lawrence Kiambi. The event, which marks its second year and is worth Sh15 million, is expected to bring together a field of 152 players mainly from the Sunshine Tour in South Africa. The field will include four top amateurs, 32 local pros and 20 regional pros. “This is a great avenue for more golfers to play at our prestigious tournament. We are redefining the golfing experience as we engage with golfers across Kenya,” said Russo. “The event is imperative for the development of golf in Kenya and the move will resonate at many levels with our agenda to grow sports in East Africa as one of the biggest sponsors across disciplines,” he added. Whilst KCB has set aside Sh12 million, hosts Karen has also reached out to other sponsors to support the event. The event starts with the Pro-Am on July 17, where some of the amateurs who will be qualifying from the on going “Road to KCB Masters’’ series.
