Not many people will take seriously Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s announcement that water supply to areas that have been subjected to acute rationing has increased. According to Mr Sonko, this is because the water level in Ndakaini Dam, the main source of the city’s water, is now at 90 per cent. The scepticism is justifiable, considering the saga of the dam, which was reportedly only half-full during the peak of the recent long rains. The water level appears to have started rising following an outcry. The plain truth is that the city is woefully short of water. The current demand stands at 706,000 cubic metres, against a supply of 503,000 cubic metres. POPULATION INCREASE As the population continues to grow rapidly, especially in the informal settlements, there is a need to invest more in boosting water supply. Indeed, Nairobi is, perhaps, the only city where some residents get water only twice a week or none. Even if Ndakaini is now almost full, it cannot supply enough water for all the city residents. There is a need to explore and quickly develop other sources. Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company says the rationing will persist until 2026, when more sources will have been developed. WATER WASTAGE The city water firm is upbeat about the development of the northern collector project in Murang’a County and two other dams in Thika, in neighbouring Kiambu County. However, it also needs to address the problem of wastage of the water that reaches the city due to breakages in its supply network. It must step up maintenance and have a rapid response team to deal with broken pipes and other problems. It’s encouraging that the utility firm is also sinking boreholes in some areas. One area that still stands out like a sore thumb, though, is the inability to harvest rain water, leaving it just flow to waste. It’s time to harness all these resources to boost the city’s water supply.
