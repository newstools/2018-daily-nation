Kenya is set to make history on Sunday as an oil producer after transport challenges were sorted out. Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia on Saturday said Kainuk Bridge on the Kitale-Lodwar highway has been repaired after it collapsed following heavy rains. "In the meantime, our engineers from KeNHA have managed to put up a bailey bridge, which has to ensure that heavy duty vehicles use it. We came to inspect the bridge and I am satisfied with the work that the engineers have done in record time," Mr Macharia said. The temporary drift built by the Kenya National Highway Authority was washed away by floodwaters, paralysing transport on the highway that links Kenya and South Sudan for more than two months. INFRASTRUCTURE President Uhuru Kenyatta will on Sunday flag off four trucks transporting 600 barrels of oil from Ngamia 8 in Lokichar, Turkana County, to Mombasa. "This is a turning point in the history of our country because for the first time we will start exporting oil... we had to make sure that we facilitated the historic achievement," he said. He said a new bridge will be constructed at a cost of Sh1.2 billion, to be completed by March next year. To safeguard the road, there will be weighbridges to ensure vehicles are not overloaded. The ministry will require Sh20 billion to repair roads damaged following the heavy downpour.   Turkana leaders will support the fast-tracking of the transportation of oil by road.
