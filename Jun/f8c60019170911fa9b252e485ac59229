Turkish clothing retailer LC Waikiki opened its doors in Mombasa over the weekend as it targets the port city's middle-class shoppers. The outlet, its third in Kenya and the first outside Nairobi, is located at City Mall in the affluent Nyali suburb. “We have invested one million US dollars (Sh100 million) in every store and currently we have three branches, two in Nairobi and the one we have opened in Mombasa,” country manager Kremena Pencheva said, adding that more stores will be opened in Nairobi before the end of the year. The international clothes chain set up its first store in Kenya at the Two Rivers Mall last February followed by a second one at the Karen Hub. “Soon we are venturing into South Africa...Kenya was our entrance to the Sub Saharan market. I can say that one year later, we are not regretting since this is the best business decision,” she added. Jobs The plan to set up more stores signals more jobs for Kenyans, with the Turkish retailer saying it currently has 150 Kenyans on its payroll. “We want to at least have employed 300 Kenyans by the end of the year after we open the other three branches as we strive to sell high quality Turkish clothing ranging from shoes, clothes for men, women and kids in all our stores,” Ms Pencheva said. LC Waikiki, which currently operates 850 stores in 38 countries, says it settled on Kenya as its entry point to the region due to its stable economy, low market saturation and a fast-growing retail oriented middle class.
