There is no doubt counties have been instrumental in forging tremendous development across the country. For the first time in the five decades of independence, the advent of the counties after the 2013 elections has seen sizeable resources moved from the centre to the grassroots. With more budget allocations to the counties, the leaders and their people are increasingly prioritising their needs and implementing them. That the counties hold the key to future progress cannot be gainsaid. The growing competition between them also augurs well for the future. As recent performance evaluations and surveys have shown, none would like to be fingered as not prudently using their allocations and complementing these by endeavouring to generate their own resources. WORRYING TRENDS However, it is also in the counties that some worrying trends are emerging. Widespread corruption and wanton misuse of resources are some of the big blots on an otherwise laudable progress. All should worry about the devolving to the grassroots of the vices that bedevilled the centralised system of governance over the years.Â The shortcomings that inspired the change of governance through a new constitution in 2010 are, sadly, getting entrenched in the counties. One of the most alarming is the mounting debts. Counties are incurring expenses they cannot meet. GROWING CORRUPTION It is a poignant indication of mismanagement, but also a further indicator of growing corruption. This is the darker side of the otherwise impressive story of the progress. The potential ramifications are dire and must be arrested. There are small enterprises that have borrowed heavily hoping to tap opportunities in the devolved units, but which now risk collapse under the weight of bank loans. There is a glaring and urgent need to instil prudent management and financial discipline in the counties. This is the only way to secure the devolution dream.
