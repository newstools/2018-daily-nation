Police have arrested one of two suspects who allegedly attacked a woman outside a Makindu bar nearly severing her tongue on Sunday. Officers on patrol took the injured woman to Makindu Hospital. "She has gone to the theatre," a source at the hospital said. Witnesses said that the woman tussled with a man who had dragged her outside the bar at dawn. The attack reportedly happened after another man showed up in the bar. The assailants escaped after the attack. "She was bleeding profusely on the mouth and her tongue was dangling precariously," a man who was among the first to arrive at the scene toldÂ the Nation.
