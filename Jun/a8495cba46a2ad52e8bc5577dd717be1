Elected leaders in Kiambu County on Monday agreed to end their differences and work together. They said they had found what they termed good consensus on the issues that had triggered a rift among them. Governor Ferdinand Waititu, his deputy James Nyoro, Senator Kimani Wamatangi, Woman Rep Gathoni Wamuchomba and several MPs held a six-hour meeting at Jacaranda Hotel in Westlands. MPs who attended the meeting convened by Senator Wamatangi were Moses Kurua (Gatundu South), Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), Jude Njomo (Kiambu Town), Githua Wamachukuru (Kabete), Wanjiku Wa Kibe (Gatundu North) Ng’ang’a Kin’gara (Ruiru) and Kago wa Lydia (Githunguri). Several others sent their apologies. UPHOLD INTEGRITY According to Mr Wamatangi, it was resolved that all leaders must uphold integrity, work as a team and that routine consultative meetings be held to ensure emerging issues are handled before they turn into crises. “From now onwards, Kiambu  will be a model county in terms of leadership and service delivery,” he said. During the meeting, Mr Waititu and his deputy, who has accused the governor of mistreating him and failing to involve him in the county matters, engaged in dialogue. ENGAGIN IN SQUABBLES They agreed to be exploring ways of solving  issues without engaging in squabbles. Mr Nyoro said the meeting offered a remedy to issues he was unhappy with, adding that he would now work well with his boss. Mr Waititu said they had resolved to work together for the sake of the electorate. “We have discussed all the issues that were causing infighting, and agreed to be working together, (and) that if there is a problem between us, we should first sit down and try to sort it out before reporting it to media,” said the governor.
