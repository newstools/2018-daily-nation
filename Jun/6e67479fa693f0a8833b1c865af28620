At the end of Athletics Kenya’s National Championships at the Moi International Sports Centre today, a team will be named for the Africa Championships slated for August 1-5 in Assaba, Nigeria. Most Kenya’s elite athletes have made themselves available for selection, making the championships quite competitive. Perhaps the allure of the World Cup, also known as the Continental Cup, planned for September 8-9 this year in Ostrava, Czech Republic, is what made some of the starts to participate in the Nationals. It is at the Africa event where the continent’s team for the World Cup will be selected. While it is always good for Kenya’s world beating athletes to compete at home, the turnout at Kasarani has been worrying. The same situation was witnessed during the World Championships and Commonwealth Games trials. Sponsors have not been forthcoming despite the trials attracting top athletes. There is need for Athletics Kenya to revamp its competition and marketing dockets to make them vibrant. The haphazard change of dates of competitions disorganises athletes and coaches’ programmes especially those based aboard. A proper publicity and marketing mechanism should be put in place, where regional offices at county level are involved. A good example was when Central Rift hosted the 2016 Rio Olympics trials at the Kipchoge Keino Stadium, where the arena was full to the brim. The region played a big role in mobilising sponsorships and fans. Perhaps, a strong kitty for prize money should also be put in place to motivate the regions and athletes.
