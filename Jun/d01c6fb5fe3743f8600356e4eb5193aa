The body of a schoolgirl who went missing in Kigumo, Murangâ€™a has been found. The 9-year-old girl was defiled strangled to death and her body dumped at a nearby maize farm in Muthithi village, police say. The girl went missing on Tuesday on her way home from school. Her parents with the help of villagers searched for her and located her lifeless body on Thursday. The victim's mother said the body of her daughter had knife injuries and a knife was left on top of her body with her school uniform torn into pieces. Kigumo police boss Ibrahim Mchumwa said investigations into the incident are at an advanced stage. He urged locals to give the police time to conclude investigations. "The preliminary investigations reveal that the minor was defiled, strangled and had knife injuries in her thighs and hands. It's just a matter of time before we arrest a suspect," the police boss said. He noted that the crime may have been committed elsewhere and the body of the girl dumped in the maize farm. The defilement and murder of the girl comes barely a month after two minors from Ichichi village in Kangema were defiled and murdered. The 5-year old and the 4-year old were allegedly defiled and killed by a 14-year old teenager and 40-year old man respectively. After a week, the teenager suspected of defiling and killing the girl was lynched by a mob while the man is facing murder charges at a Kangema court.
