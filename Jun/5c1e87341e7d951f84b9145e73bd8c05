Locals in Lamu Old Town were on Friday treated to free goods from traders buoyed by good sales during the Ramadhan period. Hundreds of residents thronged the Mkunguni Square open market where they received bagfuls of free clothes and other wares. This is the first time traders in the town have given locals free clothes during Idd-ul-Fitr celebrations. Speaking to journalists on Friday, Mr Mahenzo Kalu, a trader said this year’s Ramadhan period had been a fruitful one. Mr Kalu said their decision to give their customers clothes for free was to show gratitude. Since the start of this week, traders in Lamu Island have enjoyed steady business with many locals thronging the market in preparations for Friday’s Idd-ul-Fitr celebrations. “We are happy today. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are marking Idd-ul-Fitr. We have gained huge profits out of it and that is why we have decided to treat our customers with free clothes. We are grateful for the sales we made,” said Mr Kalu. Another trader, Mr Samuel Otieno, said for the last one week they sold most of their stock, thanks to the Lamu residents. “We came all the way from Kongowea market in Mombasa…Within a week, they bought items that could have taken us a whole month to sell,” said Mr Otieno. Ms Wanjiro Kimani could not hide her happiness after selling most of her stock during the Ramadhan period. “This is a unique year. All our items were bought compared to other years when we were forced to return some of our wares for lack of customers. We thank God,” said Ms Kimani. The biggest beneficiaries included cosmetic shop owners, public buses, boat operators and household goods retailers.   Idd-ul-Fitr celebrations begin countrywide.
