Migori Water and Energy Executive Rebecca Maroa was on Monday blocked from entering her office by workers over salary arrears. The more than 60 Migori Water and Sanitation Company staff say they have not been paid for six months. They used thorns to barricaded the entrance and padlocked the gate. "We have not been paid for six months and our statutory deductions have also not been remitted. We have had several meetings with our boss but she is not helpful," a worker said. POVERTY He said that lack of money has led to family breaks ups and made them live from hand to mouth. They urged Governor Okoth Obado to come to their aid. At around 10am, Ms Maroa arrived with three armed police officers who tried to unlock the gate. Mr Cyprian Amwaba, the workers' representative, said they will not relent until their problems are solved. "Ms Maroa will have to carry the three armed police officers daily to work because she will be meeting locked gates until we are paid," Mr Amwaba said. "We want to know how you can live with your wife and children for six months without her even eating a piece of fish because you are not paid, we are hurting." KENYA POWER Attempts to get a comment from Ms Maroa failed as she instructed the police officers to turn the press away. "The executive is not ready to talk to the press. She has instructed us not to allow you in her office. You are free to leave," an officer said. Besides workers' unrest, the water agency has also been plagued by long standing feuds with Kenya Power over failure to settle bills. Hence, Kenya Power has been disconnecting power supply, resulting in water shortages.
