Governments are, by nature, complex and secretive but, nonetheless, they have structures and systems that work. There are clear systems and procedures for appointments and termination of contracts. The current Constitution made a deliberate attempt to bring clarity to this by stipulating that all public appointments must be done through a competitive process and must at all times reflect the face of the country. Despite such provisions, appointments and exits are mired in mystery because decisions are made exclusively by the President. This time round, President Uhuru Kenyatta completed constituting the current government in February, itself a process that dragged for too long following the intractable political environment last year. TERMINATE CONTRACTS But this does not explain why it took so long to formally terminate contracts of 12 principal secretaries who were left out when new appointments were made several months ago. It is ridiculous that it is only now that the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua has deemed it fit to write to the PSs to terminate their contracts – they have been given up to the end of this month to exit. The whole thing is quite disconcerting. All this while nothing productive was going on in those offices – decisions were deferred and services compromised as the officers agonised over their fate – so it was a loss to everyone. GENEROUS PERKS So the question is: Why have these officers been kept in office, enjoying generous perks when the government knew pretty well it did not require their services? Why does it take so long to make decisions on such contracts? Can’t we have a neater process of hiring and exiting public officers? The government should perfect its systems and create sanity in the process of contracting top officials to uphold the dignity of those offices.
