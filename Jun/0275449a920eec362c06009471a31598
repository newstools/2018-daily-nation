The pledge of cheaper electricity bills next month is rare good news for the consumers, who have been grappling with the high cost of this essential utility. Indeed, the announcement comes not long after there was an outcry over huge power bills for households and industries. Some consumers were stunned to receive demands for double what they had been paying. It’s even much better news for industries and small-scale businesses that rely on electricity for their daily operations. The joy to be felt in the households will also be extended to the cottage industries and small businesses such as restaurants, bars, beauty and hair salons, whose costs soar to the roof due to expensive power. HIGHER BILLS Whatever explanations the Energy Regulatory Commission gives, including generation, distribution and maintenance costs, it’s also quite evident that the cost of electricity is pushed up by the numerous levies that are slapped on the consumers. They include the fuel levy and foreign currency costs. Indeed, the consumers will be hoping that this highly anticipated respite is not something that will only last for a short time, with the higher electricity bills regime returning with a vengeance. DROP IN TARIFFS The regulator is promising an eight per cent drop in tariffs from next month, continuing a period that has seen a reduction in power bills, thanks to a reduction in the use of the expensive diesel-generated power. It's instructive to note that this reduction was a result of a rise in the water levels in the hydro-electric dams, thanks to the good rains received recently. Also laudable is the preparation of a new power tariff structure with lower charges and the decision to spare consumers from paying a fixed cost. What the country badly needs is affordable electricity that can be sustainable instead of temporary reliefs such as the one they will enjoy next month.
