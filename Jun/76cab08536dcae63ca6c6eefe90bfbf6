The government has ordered all heads of procurement and accounting units in ministries, departments, agencies and State corporations to step aside as the war on corruption intensifies. In a statement by Interior Ministry Spokesperson Mwenda Njoka, the public servants have been asked to hand over to their immediate deputies as the process to subject them to fresh vetting takes shape. The officers are also required to submit information on their assets, liabilities and previous work record. "Whereas the exercise is geared towards determining suitability to continue holding public office in the public trust, and promote confidence in the public service, the same will be undertaken in a fair and objective manner; exercised with due care and regard to officers' rights as enshrined in the Constitution," the statement reads. POLYGRAPH The information should be delivered to the Office of the Head of Public Service by Friday at Harambee House. The latest house cleaning comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta on Madaraka Day ordered vetting of all government procurement officers by end month. They will also take polygraph tests and those who do not pass will be sent home. PSCU, on its twitter handle, said the public servants will still get their salaries but will only travel after they are cleared by the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua. SALARIES Mr Kenyatta vowed to ensure corruption is fought and defeated just "as colonialism was defeated". He also emphasised that the buck stops with the entire senior team in charge of investigations and prosecutions, saying they are new and adequately resourced. President Kenyatta pledged to transform the government into an instrument of public service and urged Kenyans to take responsibility in the anti-graft campaign.   Suspects among 27 wanted by DCI.
