A family in Nakuru is spending sleepless nights following disappearance of their son. Fifteen-year-old Mark Jewel Lumula went missing from their home at Shaba estate on Sunday at around 9am. According to his guardian, Ms Faith Lumula, the boy had gone out to look for a shop but did not return home. “We suspect that because it was on a Sunday, he found the shops closed and he decided to look further but was unable to trace his way back home,” she said. Ms Lumula said she has been living with Jewel for the last one year and he schools at Shah Lalji Nangpar Academy in Nakuru. “He was initially living in Mombasa,” she added. She said she had so far reported to various police stations in Nakuru— including Central, Bondeni and Kaptembwa.
