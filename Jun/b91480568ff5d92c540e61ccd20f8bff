Ms Anne Wambere Ngirita, one of the accused in the Sh8 billion NYS scandal, has complained of starvation in cell. Ms Ngirita raised the issue when she attended a pre-trial conference on their cases at the Milimani Law Courts on Wednesday. Through lawyer Cliff Ombeta, she told the anti-corruption court in Nairobi that the last time she had a meal was Sunday. And in an exclusive interview with the Nation, Ms Ngirita, who first appeared in court carrying a baby, said she has been surviving on the samosas a relative brought her. “How can we follow these proceedings when we are hungry? We are starving," she said. Authorities at Lang’ata Prison in Nairobi, she said, do not want them to raise the issue in court. "We are being treated as if we have been convicted,” another woman in the case said. Mr Ombeta sought the issue to the court’s attention when his clients appeared before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. He wanted the magistrate to order that the suspects be given biscuits and water before the case starts. However, the magistrate did not give any directions on the issue. Instead, Mr Ogoti directed that the pre-trial conference proceed.   Naivasha mother, two daughters and son received amounts totalling Sh300m, NYS documents show.
