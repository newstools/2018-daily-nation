PARIS Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki downed France's Pauline Parmentier 6-0, 6-3 to reach the Roland Garros fourth round on Friday. The second seed, a quarter-finalist in Paris last year, will face Russia's Daria Kasatkina for a place in the last eight. Second seed Wozniacki had led 6-0, 5-0 before Parmentier saved a little pride with a late rally.
