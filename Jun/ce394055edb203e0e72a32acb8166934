Kenyan international left back Abud Omar has signed for Belgian top flight side Cercle Brugge, the club announced on Saturday. The 25-year-old joins the Belgian side on a Bosman from Bulgarian side Slavia Sofia. “We are happy to announce the arrival of Omar. He is a player with many qualities, who will certainly make progress and will show himself this season in the Jupiler Pro league,” club sports director Francois Vitali is quoted in the club portal. Brugge have been monitoring the player for a while and wanted to swoop for him in the January transfer window but settled on Benin's Emmanuel Imorou. The former Bandari and Tusker man joins compatriot Johanna Omolo at the club. The Brugge-based club plays its home matches at the 29, 945-capacity Jan Breydel Stadium that they share with rivals Club Brugge. Cercle, owned by French Ligue 1 side AS Monaco, are three-time Belgian Pro League champions and have won the Belgian Cup twice.
