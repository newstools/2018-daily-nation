Thirty-three students of Kangubiri Girls Secondary School were on Saturday morning injured after a bus ferrying them to Nairobi overturned at Tambaya on Nyeri-Mukurweini road. The students, who suffered minor injuries, were rushed to Mukurweini and Nyeri County Referral hospitals for treatment. Mukurweini Hospital Superintendent Kelvin Kibaara told the Nation that two girls were in critical condition after suffering deep cuts. “They are in stable condition. We received 33 students at 9.30a.m. Two had deep cuts and the rest soft injuries,” said the doctor. The school principal, Ms Agnes Mathenge, said the students were picked by the Rukagina Sacco bus at the school gate at 9.00 am to head home for their mid-term holiday. “The bus is owned by one of the parents. The students were picked at the gate because that is our regulation. All were heading to Nairobi,” said Ms Mathenge. She added: “A short while after releasing them, I got a call that they have been involved in an accident at Tambaya. Eye witnesses said the bus had a tyre burst before it crashed.” At the scene of the accident, the local assistant sub chief John Waruru said the bus had a tyre burst while descending a hill. “It was not on high speed. The bus had a tyre burst before the driver lost control and landed on the roadside. We are thankful it never fell in the nearby Tambaya River which is a few metres away,” said the administrator.
