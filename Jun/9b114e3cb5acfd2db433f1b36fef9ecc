Mount Kenya University has signed an agreement with Bonn–Rhein-Sieg University of Germany, which will see the two institutions cooperate in teaching, research, development and other areas. The four-year project will be cascaded to other universities in the country and the continent in general. It will be financed by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). MKU Vice-Chancellor Prof Stanley Waudo and Prof Hartmut Ihne, the president of Bonn–Rhein-Sieg University, signed the agreement on behalf of their institutions. “The academic cooperation between the universities will make possible the strengthening of partnership between the two countries and facilitate a deeper understanding of their living and working conditions,” the agreement read. The cooperation will be chiefly concerned with the exchange of academic, technical and administrative employees, students in undergraduate programmes, the establishment of direct data links and other electronic communication and the publication of joint papers and technical communication on collaborative work. FEW DETAILS Others areas will include the organisation of conferences, seminars and workshops. It will also involve dissemination and certification of study and research programmes. Each host institution will assist in locating accommodation for staff and students in the exchange programmes. Kenyatta University will also benefit from the programme but its details on the collaboration have not been made public. The vice-chancellor or other senior management staff could not be reached for comment. Mt Kenya and Kenyatta are the only two African universities in the four-year-long project.
