Mandera County Assembly Speaker Mohamed Adan Khalif has confirmed removal of majority leader Mr Abdi Hassan Ali and his immediate replacement by Mr Abdi Adan Ali. Mr Hassan Ali was voted out on Wednesday by Economic Freedom Party ward representatives who accused him of incompetence but the party denied sanctioning his removal. Speaker Khalif said the ward representatives followed the law in removing Mr Hassan Ali and that his office was satisfied with grounds the EFP member gave for his ouster. “Minutes of a meeting in which these members deliberated on the fate of this position holder were forwarded to my office by Chief Whip and I confirmed they complied with the law in their undertaking,” he said. The Speaker said he communicated the EFP members’ decision to the county assembly automatically kicking the former majority leader out of office. “The position of the leader of majority is now being held by Mr Abdi Adan Ali after EFP members elected him following a two-day meeting to remove the previous office holder,” Mr Khalif said. EFP members had accused Mr Ali of incompetence and leadership failure on the House floor. The Speaker denied claims he plotted the removal of the majority leader after it was alleged Mr Ali had hinted on a plan to impeach him. “I have nothing to do with political party decisions or issues in the House. I don’t see why I would be interested in having the leader of majority removed from office,” said Mr Khalif. But the Speaker showered the new leader with praises. “When it comes to competency issues, the new leader is better considering his wide experience in the teaching fraternity and having worked in government,” he said. On Thursday, however, the EFP leadership denied sanctioning removal of the majority leader and promised to investigate his ouster.   The leaders accused Abdi Hassan Ali of being incompetent.
