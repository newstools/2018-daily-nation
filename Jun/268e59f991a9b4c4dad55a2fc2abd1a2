One fisherman died Friday after a boat capsized in the Indian Ocean. The boat was carrying five fishermen, three of whom were rescued and one is still missing. Lamu West OCPD Juma Londo said the incident occurred in the evening in Lamu County. "It was around 6.30pm when the boat capsized in the Indian Ocean waters at Manda-Maweni. Marine and regular police in coordination with locals divers have launched a search and rescue mission to find the missing fisherman," he said. The three were rescued by their fellow fishermen. The boat is said to have capsized due to excess weight. The body is at King Fahad County Hospital morgue where the survivors were also taken.   Bodies of seven people who died in the Indian Ocean recovered Monday.
