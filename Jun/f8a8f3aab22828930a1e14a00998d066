Police in Mombasa on Tuesday shot dead two suspected criminals said to be members of a gang that has been terrorising local residents. The two were gunned down at a hideout which is a few metres from the Island side of the busy Likoni channel. Urban OCPD Eliud Monari said they recovered a toy pistol and two machetes from the suspected gangsters. “They were challenged to stop but refused and that is when our officers fatally injured the two whom we also found with a stolen pouch. We believe these are the thugs who have been terrorising our people,” said Mr Monari. Mr Monari said a third suspect escaped the police dragnet and a manhunt is on to capture him. OFFICER KILLED Two weeks ago, two other suspected gang members were also gunned down in Kisauni. On June 13, police shot dead the two hours after a Flying Squad officer died from stab wounds inflicted by criminals the previous day. The two were killed in Magodoroni where the officer was stabbed at. Police said the two suspects were armed with machetes and were part of the gang that fatally stabbed the Flying Squad officer. The dreaded Wakali Kwanza gang has been terrorising residents in Kisauni with the Flying Squad officer and a Tanzanian national their latest victims. The gang reportedly operates under the influence of drugs and has no fear even for security officers.
