The second round of the Fifa World Cup kicks off in Russia today. And for the first time since the 1982 tournament in Spain, there will be no African nation among the last 16, with the continent’s five representatives —Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal and Nigeria — all bowing out in the group stage. This is a serious indictment of the state of African football which, bizarrely, comes at a time the continent boasts some of the leading players in the European professional leagues. Africa’s slot at the finals will increase from the current five to nine when USA, Mexico and Canada jointly host the 2026 World Cup. But does the continent deserve such extra allocation given the pedestrian showing in Russia? The continent’s football chiefs must go back to the drawing board and dissect the performances in Russia and deliberate on how to deliver an improved show when Qatar hosts the next World Cup in 2022. There’s need for the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to lead a thorough post-mortem and see how technical aspects of the game on the continent can be improved. Leagues on the continent also need to improve in quality because African clubs have also failed to deliver at the Fifa Club World Cup. One would have thought hosting the World Cup on the continent in 2010 would have spurred the development of our technical base. We all hoped that Roger Milla and Cameroon’s colourful display in 1990, Sene-gal’s brave run in 2002 and Ghana’s near-miss in 2010 - the only three times we have fielded a team at the quarter-final - were a prelude to Africa’s future super performance. But, sadly, the continent seems to take two steps back for every forward step. The poor outing in Russia should be a wake-up call for CAF to thoroughly examine the continent’s technical deficiencies.
