Tension has gripped several villages in Suba South after residents torched 17 houses whose owners are accused of witchcraft. The houses were burnt down in Mwikongo, Kisaku and Kitawa villages in Homa Bay County. The affected families are now seeking shelter elsewhere following the attack. Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum said an elderly woman was injured in the incident. “A 70-year-old woman got injuries when her granary was torched. She was taken to St Camillus Mission Hospital in Migori County for treatment,” he said. According to the police boss, at least 200 angry villagers stormed the affected houses and accused their owners of engaging in witchcraft. Mr Tum said security officers have been dispatched to the affected villages. He cautioned residents against taking security matters into their own hands. “I appeal to residents to work closely with the police to enable us apprehend suspects,” said Mr. Tum.
