YEKATERINBURG Senegal dropped Stoke City's Mame Diouf in favour of clubmate Papa Alioune Ndiaye for Sunday's crucial World Cup Group H match against Japan, who are unchanged. Liverpool star Sadio Mane will again captain the Senegal side and he will be partnered by Ismaila Sarr and Mbaye Niang in a three-pronged attack. Ndiaye, better known as Badou, comes in into the midfield in Senegal's only change following their 2-1 victory over Poland. Japan coach Akira Nishino keeps the same XI who started their surprise opening 2-1 win over Colombia. Victory for either side on Sunday in Yekaterinburg would virtually seal a place in the last 16 in Russia.
