A man who raped his five-year-old step-daughter in Makueni County will spend 80 years in jail, a court decided Thursday. Senior resident magistrate at Kilungu Law Courts Charles Mayamba found the suspect guilty of the offence he committed last year. The suspect, menial worker, attacked his step-daughter on an unspecified date in December when his wife had left home to fetch water. On returning, she found her daughter crying with blood trickling on her feet. The mother did not immediately report the incident to the police as her husband had threatened to kill her. Unable to bear the suffering of her daughter, she confided to her neighbour, who reported the incident at Salama Police Station and took the girl for medication. Medical examinations confirmed the girl was raped. Her hymen had been broken and she had been infected with a sexually transmitted disease. In his defence, the suspect said that the charges had been fabricated. He accused his wife of being a beneficiary of the "fabricated charges". "In case she is using these fabricated charges as an excuse to seek a divorce she should let me know," he told the court. But Mr Mayamba rubbished the defence as "mere denials" and found the man guilty. The 30-year-old has 14 days to appeal the sentence
