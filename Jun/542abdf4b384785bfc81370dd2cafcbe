Five GSU officers have been killed in Liboi, Garissa County after their vehicle ran over an improvised explosive device. Dadaab Deputy County Commissioner Harun Kamau said three others were critically injured in the attack on the security officers who were on patrol duty. "There was an attack this morning targeting officers on normal patrol. Unfortunately, we lost five officers while three others have been injured," Mr Kamau told the Nation phone. The attack happened about 9am at Harar in Liboi, a few meters from the Kenya-Somalia border. Mr Kamau said the injured officers will be airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment. The deputy county commissioner said reinforcements have also been sent to the area to pursue members of the Al-Shabaab militia, who are suspected to be behind the attack.
