A Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) ranger has been shot dead by unknown assailants who ambushed him in a bar in Esoit, Narok County. Trans Mara West Deputy County Commissioner Mohammed Noor said the attackers did not steal from the ranger during the Saturday night attack. "I can only confirm that a corporal in the Esoit post died following the night attack by unknown people," said Mr Noor. Three people also sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to hospital. "Police officers helped rush the three people who sustained injuries to a hospital in Kilgoris," said Mr Noor. Mr Hudson Ali, an Esoit resident, said that the incident happened at about 7pm.
