Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said he will use his newfound political friendship with President Uhuru Kenyatta to seek jobs for Coast region's election losers. Following the union with his erstwhile political enemy,, Mr Joho said he will ensure he influences the government to offer jobs to the losers who supported Jubilee Party. “I am going to ask for jobs from President Uhuru Kenyatta for all those who supported Jubilee. I will tell him that they supported them and they should benefit because that is what politics is all about,” said Mr Joho. Some of the leaders who backed Jubilee Party and have not yet been rewarded include former senator Hassan Omar, former governor John Mruttu, former Kilifi South MP Mustafa Iddi and former deputy governor Hazel Katana. Mr Joho made the remarks after Ms Katana, who was his deputy in his first term before abandoning him and joining Jubilee Party, joined him for Idd Baraza at Treasury Square in Mombasa. Mr Joho also thanked Ms Katana for working with him. “We never thanked you Hazel for the time you worked with us in the last five years but…we appreciate you,” said Mr Joho. Ms Katana vied for the senate seat and lost. Meanwhile, Mr Joho also reiterated his commitment to work with President Kenyatta. “When I received President Kenyatta last week I said we used to talk at each other but we will now be speaking with each other and that is because of the good gesture my party leader Raila Odinga showed by initiating the Building Bridges initiative,” said Mr Joho. When he received the President at Bonje during the official opening of the first phase of the Dongo Kundu bypass, Mr Joho stood next to the president and his deputy, William Ruto at the main dais. He promised to mobilise residents to attend President Kenyatta's events as the political tide at the Coast continued to change following the Uhuru-Raila ceasefire.   Mr Odinga steers clear of the DP’s forays in his strongholds.
