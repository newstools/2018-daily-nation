Death toll from Rift Valley Fever ravaging parts of north-eastern Kenya has risen to five. This is after one more person succumbed to the disease on Sunday in Wajir County. NEW BAN Seven other patients are currently admitted to various hospitals in the border county with the disease that is now threatening to spread to other areas of the country. Wajir County health executive Abdihakim Billow, who confirmed the death, on Monday said they had put in place several measures to stop the infection from spreading further. This comes after Mandera and Garissa counties issued an alert over the spread of the fever that kills human beings and livestock. Last week, Wajir county government banned meat and milk consumption in Eldas and Wajir West sub-counties. Mr Billow said the ban has now been extended to the whole county after the rise in human and livestock deaths. In the latest directive, slaughtering of animals and  and consumption of animal products will not be allowed  in the county for the next nine days. The temporary ban, which took effect on June 11, is expected to end on June 21, according to the county health department. 40 ANIMALS The department on Sunday met with butchers to inform them about the situation of the RVF and the ban. The meat dealers were asked to collaborate and support the ban , which aims at preventing further spread of the RVF. The ban is likely to have a big negative impact on the residents most of whom depend on pastoralism. Over 40 animals, including camels and goats, have died in Wajir since the outbreak of the disease. A taskforce bringing together officials from county and the national government has been set up to help control the spread of the disease. The  team has since been dispatched to the affected areas.   Four people have died since the outbreak of the virus.
