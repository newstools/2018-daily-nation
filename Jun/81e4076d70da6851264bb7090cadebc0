SINGAPORE, US President Donald Trump touched down in Singapore on Sunday ahead of a historic summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, where Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal will top the agenda. Trump and Kim are due to hold talks — the first-ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader — on Tuesday, with Trump describing the meeting as a "one-time shot" at peace. Neither Trump nor his aides made any comment to reporters on the plane. The president waved at the top of the stairs, descending alone before breaking into a smile and greeting various officials from hosts Singapore. Trump then boarded his armour-plated car to head for his luxury hotel in Singapore, accompanied by a motorcade of around 30 vehicles.   North Korean leader has re-committed his isolated state to denuclearisation.
