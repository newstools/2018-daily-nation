A former officer commanding station at Muranga Police Station has been charged with shooting a resident of Mukuyu market three times in 2014 causing him a grievous bodily harm. George Anyonje Ndirire is accused that on July 24, 2014 at Mukuyu market in Murang'a County, he knowingly shot Antony Mwangi Muthoni injuring him. Although the complainant filed the case against Mr Ndirire in 2016, the suspect had not been going to court forcing chief magistrate Margaret Wachira to issue warrant of arrest. SH30,000 Even after the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions gave the directions to charge Mr Ndirire in March 2016, the suspect was never arrested and on May 9, 2018 the chief magistrate issued summons to District Criminal Investigations Officer Muranga East to appear in court and explain why the accused had not been arrested. After appearing in court on June 6, the DCIO officer promised to arrest Mr Ndirire who had resigned from the police after landing a job at Kimathi University in Nyeri County as a security officer. The suspect took plea on June 11 where he denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh30,000. The magistrate slated the mention date to be on June 25 when she will give directions of the hearing date for the case. ASSAULT The prosecution led by Rodgers Alloo told the court that they have four witnesses to the incident that saw the suspect become a regular visitor to Kenyatta National Hospital as he fought for his life. The complainant alleged that he was shot three times in the hand, leg and stomach. But immediately after the shooting, Mr Muthomi was arrested and charged with three counts of assaulting the police officer, creating disturbance in the public and being armed, counts that landed him in jail for two years. His jail term ended in 2016 after which he initiated the charges against the ex-police officer.
