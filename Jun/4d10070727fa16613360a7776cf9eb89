A school in Kigumo, Murang’a County now faces imminent closure after the public health department said it is unsafe for pupils since its latrines are full. The school has now been given a 21-day notice to construct new latrines. Mariira Day and Boarding Primary School, which is one of the best schools in Murang’a County, received the statutory notice from the Kigumo Sub-county public health office on Thursday, warning that failure to fulfil the requirements will lead to its closure. The school’s headteacher John Chege said this is the second time the public health department has sent them a letter, adding that they have no funds to construct new pit latrines. He said their efforts to approach the NG-CDF officials in the constituency and the county government have not yielded fruit. APPEAL TO WELL-WISHERS The headteacher said if the government and well-wishers will not come in to help the school, it will be closed in three weeks’ time. “I plead for help from well-wishers, the alumni of this school as well as government agencies to come in and save us from the risk of closing the school. We have been approaching the CDF offices and the county government and we have not gotten any help,” Mr Chege said. Mr Lawrence Maina, the chairman of the school’s board of management, said they not only fear about the possible closure but also the outbreak of diseases. He said almost all the latrines filled up at the same time leaving the pupils with no choice but to share the only remaining two. “We fear for the health of the learners. Classes are dirty and if nothing is done the children may get sick,” he said.
