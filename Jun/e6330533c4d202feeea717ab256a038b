Gloria Mulei on Saturday shattered the 19-year Kenyan women’s triple jump record as Athletics Kenya National Championships ended at Kasarani. The 18-year-old Mulei, who is a form four student at Kwanthanze Girls, scaled 12.97 metres in the final to erase Caroline Kola’s previous record on 12.91m set during the Nationals on June 20, 2001. While Mulei’s exploits saw her surpass the qualifying standard distance for the World Under-20 Championships due for July 10-15 in Tampere, Finland, she failed to make it for the Africa Championships planned for August 1-5 in Assaba, Nigeria. Mulei scaled 12.82m during World Under-20 trials, missing the qualifying mark of 12.85m but was promised a place in the junior team if she managed the distance at the Nationals. “I am so delighted to make the World Under-20 team. I am ready for the championships,” said Mulei adding that she worked on her hop, jump and landing skills to break the national record. Kola, who is Mulei’s coach, said she is proud of her student, having worked hard on her landing skills after the World Under-20 trials. “I'm proud of her since she was only nine months old when I set the record. The record still belongs to me since it’s my girl who broke it,” said Kola, adding that her participation at the World Under-18 will give good experience.   Rutto said he is ready for his Africa Championships debut.
