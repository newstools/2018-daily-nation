Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana will host the other 46 county leaders in Wote next month for a peer learning conference on the county’s successful public participation approach. Prof Kibwana said the forum would bring together all governors and top county officials from across the country to compare notes on various success stories. The conference will be held in the second week of July. “We are happy that many counties are coming to Makueni to benchmark. We believe that each has a story to tell about devolution. That is why we are opening our doors to host this momentous forum,” Prof Kibwana said. DEVELOPMENTHe added that through the participatory approach, Makueni people have a say on public-funded projects. “This ensures that they own the projects and widens the supervisory net. It is through this approach that the county has rolled out major projects,” he said. The public participatory approach had been used to develop annual budgets and the County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs). “This year, up to 120,000 people took part in the making of our 2018-2022 CIDP.” LEARNING He praised Kisumu for its public service system modelled on the national government plan pioneered by former Head of Public Service Francis Muthaura. “Meru is on top in the creation of parastatals to undertake certain roles for the government. "We will be in Meru next month to learn a few things from their success stories. Kwale’s structure of Early Childhood Development and Education (ECDE) system is among the best," he said. And added: "It is good that we now have a Maarifa Centre at the Council of Governors from where people can access information on what is happening in other counties." Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau said county governments have a lot to learn from one another, while County Secretary Paul Wasanga lauded the new system for facilitating access to information held by other counties.
