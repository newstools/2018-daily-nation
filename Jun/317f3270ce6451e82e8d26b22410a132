Two people are in the ICU after a cooking gas cylinder exploded in a house in Nyeri town. One other person is also admitted at the Nyeri County Referral Hospital following the Wednesday night explosion that neighbours say ripped off the houseâ€™s roof. Those were injured in the explosion are a woman, her child and neighbour. "We just heard a loud bang and almost immediately there was a huge cloud of smoke in the air," said Ms Jane Wanjiku, a neighbour. This is the second cooking gas cylinder explosion to happen in Nyeri town in a month. In the previous incident, 16 people were hospitalised after a gas cylinder exploded in a restaurant at Mudavadi market in Nyeri County. Following the explosion, residents have raised concerns over counterfeit gas cylinders. They want the Energy Regulatory Commission to conduct a crackdown in the county to arrest traders suspected of selling fake gas cylinders.   The incident happened on Sunday inside a hotel at Mudavadi market.
