National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale has said he has tabled before a parliamentary committee a list of people he claimed have been imported sugar which is unfit for human consumption. Speaking Saturday during the launch of Garissa High School alumni, the Garissa Township MP said all people behind the importation of the sugar said to be contaminated will be known on Tuesday. Mr Duale said the report he tabled before the Trade and Agriculture committee has over sixty importers and a person who brought 185 tons of poisonous sugar. “A report of people who imported sugar that is not fit for human consumption is with a committee of parliament and their names will be known on Tuesday,” said Mr Duale. There has an uproar following reports of importation of sugar said to contain dangerous components like copper. “Sugar tycoons, [whoever] they are, [whichever] regions they come from, will account for their business dealings before the parliamentary committee,” Mr Duale said. The MP said he supports Presidents Uhuru Kenyatta’s recent call for lifestyle audits of all civil servant. He said for the president to leave behind good legacy, he should clear all the mess in the country. “We are more than prepared for the lifestyle audit. We must know who owns what; we must clear this country of corruption. We must who are the importers of bad sugar, (those) selling drugs and (those) destroying forests,” he added.
