A total of 152,000 teachers in lower cadres will get their full package as this will be the final year of the implementation of the CBA while those in higher cadre will be paid until 2021. CBA Last year in July, the TSC started the implementation of the Sh54 billion CBA and it used Sh13.7 billion for the increase. The implementation in two phases is for teachers in job groups H and J while teachers in the upper cadre, who are mostly in administrative positions, will have the increase implemented in four phases. The deal overhauled the current grading system and the final implementation report of the CBA will run until June 30, 2021. The agreement also abolished the P1 teacher position, which was Job Group G, and those in the grade moved to H, which is known as B5. Under the CBA, Senior Master (III) falls under T Scale 9, Senior Master (II) under T Scale 10, while Senior Master (I) is T Scale 11. For deputy school heads, the Deputy Principal (IV) falls under T Scale 10, Deputy Principal (III) under T Scale (11), and Deputy Principal (II) in T Scale 12 as Deputy Principal (I) falls under T Scale 13. The new TSC grading structure ranges from (B5 to D5), that is T Scale 5 to 15. The government has set aside Sh5 billion for the recruitment of additional teachers.
