Kisumu County Government is eyeing film production to enhance local content development as a viable investment. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said the lakeside county will encourage public private partnerships (PPP) where investors will be invited to the sector. He said the move would be in line with the Communications Authority of Kenya Programming Code that requires television and radio broadcasters to air 40 per cent local content. “The County Government of Kisumu has established that the film industry serves as a useful tool for tapping the artistic energies of creative members of the county and can be a vehicle for diversification of our exports, as locally produced films can be marketed elsewhere,” he said.

He noted that many world famous films such as Born Free, Living Free, Forever Free, Walking with Lions and Lion King, have been shot in Kenya.
