Vet Lab Sports Club will host the third edition of the rotational Victoria Cup golf championship between Kenya and Uganda from July 25 to 28. During the second edition held at Entebbe Golf Club last year, Kenya, which had won the inaugural event at Muthaiga Golf Club in June 2016, beat their hosts Uganda by two points to retain the cup donated by former Boston Marathon champion and immediate captain of Eldoret Golf Club Moses Tanui. As usual, each of the two countries will be represented by teams of 10 players each and the format will again by the Ryder Cup style which includes foursomes, four ball better ball and singles. This will be the first international event to be held at the par 72 Vet Lab course which this year hosted its first major event, the Barclays Kenya Open pre-qualifying tournament. Each side is expected to parade some of its top amateurs during the event, which the two countries will be using it as a dress rehearsal for the inaugural Africa Region Four (formerly East Africa Challenge Cup) also being hosted by Kenya from August 1 to 5 at Nyali Golf and Country Club, Mombasa. The Kenya Golf Union (KGU) will meet next Tuesday to announce the criteria which will be used to select Kenya’s team for the Victoria Cup and the Region Four events. Newly elected KGU chairman, Lucas Maranga, expressed confidence in the preparations to host the four-day tournament. “At KGU, we have a capable team that has been working around the clock to ensure that the event is a great success. I believe the Vet Lab course is a perfect venue for the Victoria Cup and we look forward to a great match with our neighbours,” said Maranga.
