Two people have been confirmed dead after a five-storey building collapsed in Huruma early Sunday morning. According to Mr Pius Masai, the deputy director National Disaster Management Unit (NDMU), one person was found dead in the debris while another died on the way to the hospital. Three others have been hospitalised.   Mr Masai said many of the tenants of the ill-fated building left when it developed cracks shortly before midnight on Saturday.   But he said the number of buildingâ€™s occupants has not been established. Tenants in the nearby buildings have been evacuated after rescuers declared the area a dangerous zone. "We have enough equipment and personnel. What is delaying is entrance to the scene," said Mr Masai. More follows...   Buildings collapse because of poor quality of concrete, lack of proper foundation and use of substandard building stones.
