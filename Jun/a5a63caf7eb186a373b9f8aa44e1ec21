Protestant churches have renewed calls for expanding the Executive. National Council of Churches of Kenya Secretary-General Peter Karanja said the country needs a premier, two deputies and an office of the official leader of opposition for inclusivity. He said Kenya should take advantage of the good relationship between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Raila Odinga to push for reforms. Speaking at Moi High School, Mbiruri in Runyenjes where he was the chief guest during the Embu ACK diocese Education day, Canon Karanja said a strong official opposition would improve oversight of the executive. He said the current system where the winner takes it all despite investing in the campaigns had sharply divided the country. Canon Karanja noted that elections in Kenya have always been emotive since communities and party supporters invested heavily in their presidential candidate and thus led to bitterness when one side lost. He said the expanded Executive and recognition of the opposition would help end the tribal division that exist due to sharing of government posts as more leaders would be accommodated. “Because all Kenyans want to be in government, we came up with this proposal saying, let us amend the constitution to expand the executive…so that three more tribes can be brought into the executive," he said.
