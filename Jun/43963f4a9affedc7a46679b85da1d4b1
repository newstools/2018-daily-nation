SAINT PETERSBURG Neymar started Brazil's crunch World Cup clash with Costa Rica on Friday as coach Tite kept faith in the side that started a disappointing 1-1 draw to open their campaign against Switzerland. Corinthians right-back Fagner replaced the injured Danilo in Brazil's only change. There had been concerns over Neymar's fitness after he limped out of training on Tuesday, two days after receiving rough treatment from the Swiss. However, Tite insisted on the eve of the game he wasn't running a risk by handing the world's most expensive player just his second competitive start for four months after his club season was ended in February by a broken bone in his right foot. Costa Rica also made just one change from their 1-0 defeat by Serbia with former Everton full-back Bryan Oviedo replacing Francisco Calvo on the left side of a five-man defence.
