The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has issued new guidelines in a bid to protect students from rape and other forms of harassement in schools. The move comes in the wake of sexual harassment allegations at Moi Girls School Nairobi and Maasai Girls in Narok, still under investigations. TSC Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia said the guidelines are aimed at enhancing the safety and welfare of all learners. “All principals and headteachers shall ensure that for any co-curricular activity-games and sports, music, drama, scouts, girl guides, educational tours, congresses, exchange programmes, debates, symposia, contests within or outside the school, pupils and students are accompanied by at least one registered teacher of the same sex depending on the number of students or pupils involved in the activities,” said Mrs Machariai in a circular dated June 13. She added that persons not registered as teachers including teachers whose names have been removed from the official register should not be incorporated in school programmes (including co-curricular activities) to teach, coach or supervise pupils or learners . School heads who violate this requirement would be held personally responsible, the circular says. It also specifies timelines for various school activities, with the condition that they should not extend late into the evening. “All teachers engaged with students or pupils in any school activity must ensure that they are released from the activities in time to enable the them reach their schools or homes before 6pm. “In boarding schools, activities programmed to take place after 6pm must end at a reasonable time but not later than 9pm,” it adds.   Team comprises sexual and gender based violence experts, forensic, pathology and safety in education practitioners.
