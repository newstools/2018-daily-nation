Some political leaders from Nandi have triggered a heated debate by claiming that parts of the neighbouring Kisumu County fall in their area. Citing colonial demarcations, the politicians are laying claim to Muhoroni and Kisumu East constituencies and some local manufacturing industries, including Chemelil Sugar Company.As expected, this has elicited loud rebuttals from their Kisumu counterparts, setting the stage for a potentially highly divisive engagement. But this is not the first such border row pitting one county against another. Disputes have been reported elsewhere in the country. SIMMERING FEUDS There are simmering feuds between Meru and Tharaka-Nithi; Kirinyaga and Embu (over the Mwea Irrigation Scheme); Laikipia and Nyandarua (Nyahururu Town); Kisii and Nyamira (Keroka Town) and Kisumu and Vihiga (over Maseno University and other institutions). Thankfully, the matter has attracted national attention and the Senate could just create a platform for resolving them amicably. A Bill by Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr proposes the establishment of a special team with powers to alter county boundaries after leaders or the public petition the Senate. REGISTERED VOTERS The County Boundaries Bill, 2017 requires a petitioner to get the support of at least 15 per cent of registered voters in a county. The Bill is currently in the Third Reading stage in the Senate, at which it will incorporate views collected during public hearings. Given the polarising nature of such spats, the Senate should hasten the passage of this Bill to provide the much-needed platform for speedy resolution of county border rows. In the meantime, leaders should desist from politicising the matter by making inflammatory statements that only serve to divide Kenyans.
