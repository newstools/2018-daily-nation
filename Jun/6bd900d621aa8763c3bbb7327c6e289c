My new girlfriend is a disaster in the kitchen. Many times her food is burnt or flat or too saltyâ€¦How do I tell her politely that she needs to do better? I once tried to suggest reducing the amount of salt and it did not go well. Are you also a disaster in the kitchen? Do you have two hands? Even one? Do you have fingers to call in for delivery as an option? Then do so. If you don't like her food, tell her and let her deal with the pouting. If she wants to change for you, she will. If she doesn't, that's also fine. The only person who has a responsibility to feed you is yourself. It is your stomach. If you don't like the food she I cooking, cook your own. Adapt, or risk hypertension. Your choice.   Even though I am jobless, I feel like she should respect my time.
