Police in Murang’a have raised the alarm over rising cases of defilement and killings of minors in the county with at least four cases reported this month. Mathioya OCPD Pauline Mwangi, who was speaking after the body of a five-year-old girl from Kamatumbi village was found defiled and dumped in a bush, claimed the incidents maybe linked to cults. "It's too much now even as we blame the drugs. I think it's also a cult," Ms Mwangi said. But she said police have launched investigations to establish the cause of the rising violent sexual abuses in the area. The body of the minor was found dumped in a bush not far from the village a day after her grandmother reported her missing. Ms Mwangi said the girl’s grandmother reported her missing on Thursday at the Nyakianga Administration Police post after desperately looking for her at their neighbour's homes. The girl went missing while going home from school. "The girl’s private parts were badly mutilated and by the look of her face she died a painful death. She demonstrated signs of severe pain and anguish," Ms Mwangi said. The incident happened two days after an elderly woman, 73, from Kigoro village in Maragua was raped and killed. In Gatanga, a three-year-old minor was defiled and her body dumped in a dam. The minor’s body was found without her tongue, finger nails and some of her hair. No one has been arrested in connected to the minor’s murder. In Kigumo, a nine-year-old girl was defiled and killed in Thamara village while going home from school and her body dumped in a maize farm. The suspect was arrested and charged with defiling and murdering the minor. In Kangema, a six-year-old girl was also defiled and killed while going home from school. Local residents later lynched a suspect. Parents have now taken precaution and have started escorting their children to and from school.   The toddler went missing 11 days ago in Nginyi, Murang'a County.
