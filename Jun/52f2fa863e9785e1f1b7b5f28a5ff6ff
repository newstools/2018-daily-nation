The Davis Cup Africa Zone Group III tennis championship starts on Monday at the Nairobi Club. The six-day tournament has attracted teams from Benin, Algeria, Namibia, Mozambique, Uganda, Nigeria, Rwanda and Cameroon. Kenya hopes to win and qualify for the Davis Cup Euro/Africa Zone Group II, due next year. The team narrowly missed out on the qualification after falling to Zimbabwe 2-0 in the Africa Zone Group III play-off. RECAPTURE PAST GLORY This is the first time Kenya is hosting the Davis Cup since 2002. When it first played in the Davis Cup in 1974, reaching the Europe/Africa Zone Group I semi-finals in 1992, that was Kenyaâ€™s best performance ever. The tournament comes a month after visiting International Tennis Federation president David Haggerty conducted the ground-breaking for a multimillion-shilling tennis centre at Kasarani, Nairobi. Tennis Kenya should be commended for a job well done. This development should spur the game's growth and help Kenya to recapture its past glory. WINNING TEAM It is encouraging that the Kenyan team for the Davis Cup is full of youngsters, who need guidance with some quality exposure. This is because it is by investing in the youth ranks that any country can hope to build a winning team for the future. However, playing tennis is an expensive undertaking. Consequently, we call upon corporate organisations to chip in, especially by funding the building of facilities so that more young people can play the sport. We also call upon Nairobi residents and many other Kenyans to turn out in large numbers and cheer our team to victory.
