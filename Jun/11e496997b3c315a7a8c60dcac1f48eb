Champions Gor Mahia opened a nine-point atop the SportPesa Premier League with a hard-fought 2-0 win over Ulinzi Stars in their rescheduled match at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru on Saturday. A first half strike from Francis Kahata and Jacques Tuyisenge's second in the second period were enough for the 16-time champions to extend their unbeaten run in the league to 17 matches. Gor have 43 points, nine more than second placed Sofapaka, who have played three more games than K’ogalo. The visitors were fast off the blocks and raided the soldiers with flair and deservedly took the lead on 19 minutes after George “Blackberry" Odhiambo picked a loose ball outside the area and rounded two of his markers before squaring the ball to Kahata to finish the move. Gor Mahia coach Dylan Kerr started with his strongest squad, which he has mostly used for continental assignments, with Tuyisenge and Meddie Kagere upfront while Kahata, Humphrey Mieno and Ernest Wendo partnered in midfield. Skipper Harun Shakava and Joash Onyango were paired at the heart of the defence while Philemon Otieno and Godfrey Walusimbi operated from thei preferred positions as wingbacks. More to follow….
