Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has denied claims of frustrating his deputy James Nyoro. Mr Nyoro on Monday said he was not comfortable with Mr Waititu’s management style. However, Mr Waititu who spoke in Limuru on Tuesday, added a new twist to the saga by saying he doubted his deputy’s academic credentials. “People have been lying but I will tell the truth. Let them show their doctorate degrees if they have studied that far,” Mr Waititu said. Ironically, the governor’s detractors also doubt his academic papers. RUNNING COUNTY The governor accused Mr Nyoro of lying that he has been running the county alone and not giving him a chance to serve residents. Mr Waititu said his deputy is always out of Kiambu “and he demands to be treated like a governor”. “People should not say that I am running the county alone. The deputy governor returned from the United States on Wednesday where he had been for two weeks,” Mr Waititu said. “Before that, he was in Turkey. If people went to his office for services, they did not wait for him.” Mr Nyoro said he was operating from a corridor because the governor’s supporters poured water in his office but Mr Waititu denied the claims. OFFICE RENOVATED He said Mr Nyoro’s office was being renovated at a cost of Sh2.5 million. Mr Waititu said even if Mr Nyoro had been locked out, the deputy governor could still have operated from other buildings in Kiambu town or Thika. “You cannot find space in my office,” he said. “The governor and his deputy have offices in Kiambu and Thika. If the Kiambu office is being repaired, he should go to Thika.” Mr Nyoro said every claim he made against Mr Waititu is true.
