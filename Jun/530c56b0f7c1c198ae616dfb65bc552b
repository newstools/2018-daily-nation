Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku has ordered an audit of all mining firms operating in the county. He warned that those found conducting business illegally will be blacklisted. Mr Lenku told the companies to re-submit their documents for verification to ensure they are legally conducting business in the county. According to Mr Lenku, miners and quarry owners in the county have not been participating in community projects despite their excavation of natural resources destroying the environment to alarming levels. The governor directed that the firms immediately start community projects or leave the region. “The projects must be on health, education and rehabilitation of roads and must be managed by a joint committee of the miners, county government and administration officials,” he said yesterday. To that effect, Mr Lenku has formed a special committee that will be chaired by the county Lands Chief Officer Moses Murunya to design a framework on a partnership that will compel the miners to set up a corporate social responsibility kitty to fund community projects. He pointed out that the environmental degradation and the destruction of the 10km KMQ road must be fixed through cooperation between the county and the miners. “We also want a commitment to have 70 per cent of both skilled and unskilled labour to come from the local community,” he said.
