There have been a number of incidents lately that raise serious questions on the conduct of some health professionals. Whenever people seek medical attention, they expect the best treatment from qualified and well-trained health workers. It’s the belief that they will get the right treatment and recover that motivates patients and their relatives to entrust their care to health professionals. The family of a cancer patient who died at the Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital has accused the institution of neglecting him — a claim the facility’s superintendent has denied. And in another incident, the public was outraged over the death of a baby at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital in unclear circumstances. QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE It’s too early to say whether or not the health professionals involved in both cases did anything wrong. Fortunately, there are elaborate mechanisms for handling such cases and it will be a matter of time before it is established whether the lives of the two patients could have been saved. However, the mounting complaints about the quality of healthcare, especially in the public hospitals and other facilities, is a pointer to a grave situation that calls for a quick re-examination and decisive steps to avert deaths. The authorities must ensure that staff strictly adhere to the code of conduct for health practitioners. And reinforcing management’s role are professional organisations that not only champion the interests of their members but also help to ensure that they observe the highest ethical standards. The rising culture of negligence must be eradicated.
