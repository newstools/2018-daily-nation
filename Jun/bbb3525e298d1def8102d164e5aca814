A principal cancelled his stay in Mombasa where 8, 000 colleagues are meeting for their annual conference after he was attacked and injured by burglars in his hotel room. The principal from Bomet County was attacked a day after criminals pounced on his colleague outside his Nyali hotel. But Kisuani OCPD Sangura Musee denied reports of any attacks on teachers. “We have not received any reports of any principal being attacked, but if there is any then we are willing to assist in investigations,” Mr Musee told the Nation on phone. ANNUAL CONFERENCE The principals are attending the 43th Kenya Secondary School Heads Association (Kessha) conference at Wild Waters in Mombasa. “The principal from my county was attacked inside his hotel where his phone and some cash were stolen from him,” said Bomet County Kessha Chairman Cornelius Sigei. The principal was staying at a hotel on Moi Avenue where other guests were also attacked by four burglars who were on a stealing spree according to police sources. The incidents come a week after a police officer and a Tanzanian national died after being attacked by machete-wielding criminals. The dreaded Wakali Kwanza gang is among gangs that have been terrorising residents in Kisauni in the recent past. The gang reportedly operates under the influence of drugs and three of its members have been killed by police officers in the last one week.   Kessha chairman Indumuli Kahi says elections are held through consensus and seats shared according to regions.
