Use of out-of-court negotiations in tax disputes has seen Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) rake in Sh8.3 billion from 181 firms. KRA Commissioner for Legal Services and Board Coordination Wairimu Ng’ang’a said the disputes handled in the past three years also saved companies and taxpayers money that would have been spent in litigation. “It provides an environment where tax disputes are amicably resolved without recourse to lengthy and costly litigation. The process is confidential, without prejudice, voluntary and non-adversarial,” she said. KRA has revamped the Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) function and hired expert ADR facilitators to mediate disputes between taxpayers and various revenue departments. READ: Why East Africa is among the best in global arbitration Ms Ng’ang’a said companies or individual taxpayers choosing ADR will have an independent review of a tax assessment conducted on their accounts. The taxpayer will be at liberty to challenge the outcome without prejudicing their rights to challenge it and get a fair hearing. “ADR is legally provided for in Article 159 (2)(c) of the Constitution as well as in other tax legislations. The Tax Procedures Act under Section 55 (1) allows parties, to a tax dispute, 90 days to resolve a matter while the Tax Appeals Tribunal Act, in Section 28(1), allows parties to a tax dispute to request to resolve a tax dispute, outside the tribunal, at any stage of the proceedings,” she observed. Nearly all tax disputes are open to ADR except in instances where a dispute requires interpretation of the law, a judgement or ruling had been made and where either party was not willing to engage in the ADR route, she said.
