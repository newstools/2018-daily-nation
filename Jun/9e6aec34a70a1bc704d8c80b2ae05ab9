An Administration Police (AP) officer has shot and critically injured three people in Litein town before killing himself. The officer attached to Litein AP camp, is said to have shot a bar attendant and two revellers at Diamond Club on Tuesday evening after he was allegedly denied alcohol. Those who were shot and critically injured were rushed to Litein Mission Hospital in Bureti sub-county for treatment. The Kericho Police Commander James Mugera said the officer, who was on duty, decided to pass by the club for a drink. “After the waiter refused to serve him, the officer took out his rifle and shot her on the stomach,” said Mr Mugera. Also shot were a Kenya Commercial Bank employee and a medical doctor. The banker was shot on the chest while the doctor was shot on the knee. Investigations have been launched even as locals claim the officer and the waitress had an affair. This is the second shooting incident to happen in Litein in few months. Recently, a Kenya Forest Service officer shot and killed his lover.
