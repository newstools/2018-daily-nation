Kenya Simbas rallied from behind to beat hosts Morocco 28-24 in Casablanca on Saturday and get their Rugby Africa Gold Cup campaign on the right footing. The championship, that doubles up for the 2019 Rugby World Cup qualifier, saw Kenya trail the Moroccans 17-14 before Moses Amusala completed Kenyaâ€™s pick-and-drive move with a try. Darwin Mukidza converted for the Simbas to lead 21-17 before Samson Onsomu collected the ball from the back of their maul to put through Tony Onyango on the wing to score their fourth try. Mukidza once again converted from a tight angle to stretch their lead to 28-17 before the Moroccans rallied to score and come within four points. Kenya would then put up a tight defence to triumph for the crucial five points even as Edmund Anya was sin-binned for collapsing the maul. Namibia had earlier on Saturday thrashed Tunisia 118-0 in Windhoek to stretch their lead to 10 points after they had downed Uganda 56-6 in Windhoek on June 16. Zimbabwe and Morocco had battled to a 23-23 draw in Harare. Kenya will now meet Zimbabwe in their second match on Saturday June 30 in Nairobi while Morocco will host Namibia in Casablanca the same day.
