Days of corrupt public officers who are used to making themselves filthy rich with taxpayers’ money through shady deals and 'tenderpreneuring' have come to an end. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday released an executive order which indicated that henceforth, accounting officers will be the ones to take personal responsibility for all public resources under their watch. In a statement from State House , Mr Kenyatta indicated that appointing letters for all accounting officers should outline this as an expected role in their agencies. PROCUREMENT The National Treasury Cabinet Secretary has been directed to guarantee the integrity of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (Ifmis) and secure seamless integration of all public procuring entities. And as result, come January 2019, all public procurements will now be undertaken only through the Ifmis. The President directed that all government entities and public owned institutions to publish full details of tenders and awards from next month, July 1.The information to be published shall include the items or services purchased, contract prices and the particulars of the suppliers including owners, directors as well as beneficial ownership. ACCOUNTABILITY According to the order, publishing of the said information will enhance the highest level of public scrutiny at all units of public administration hence improve the management of public resources for public good.“In line with the President’s commitment to entrench good governance in the management of public affairs, and deepen accountability and transparency in the procurement of public goods, works and services, His Excellency has today issued an Executive Order,” Statehouse spokesman Manoah Esipisu said, adding “The order is premised on the constitutional principles on public financial management."
