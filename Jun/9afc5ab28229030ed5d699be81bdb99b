Police in Nyandarua North are looking for people who have been impersonating officers from the National Environment Management Authority (Nema) to extort money from residents. According to Nyandarua North police boss Timon Odingo, the individuals have been posing as Nema officers while accusing residents of flouting the waste disposal law. “Since they are in possession of fake Nema badges, they tricked residents by threatening to take them to the police. "They later negotiate a specific fine and the unsuspecting residents end up giving them money,” said Mr Odingo.
