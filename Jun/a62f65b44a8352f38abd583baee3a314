Three suspects linked to the Sh469 million National Youth Service (NYS) scandal have presented themselves to court on Tuesday but chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti ejected them from the proceedings saying he has no jurisdiction to handle them. The magistrate said the three suspects “belong to the police”. The suspects, Josephat Njoroge, Anthony Wamiti and Peter Kimani failed to appear in court on Monday and the court issued a warrant for their arrest. Mr Wamiti and Mr Kimani are the directors of Arkroad Holdings Limited which allegedly received Sh24 million from the NYS for goods not supplied. Yesterday, their lawyer Kirathe Wandugi told magistrate Ogoti that the two were to appear in court but a "terrible jam" made it impossible for them. He asked the court to defer the plea to today but the application was rejected by senior assistant Director of Public Prosecution Emily Kamau. Ms Kamau told the court that Mr Wandugi had made an undertaking last week to present them to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations but failed to do as directed. Mr Ogoti directed the police to arrest them and bring them to court.   Suspects among 27 wanted by DCI.
