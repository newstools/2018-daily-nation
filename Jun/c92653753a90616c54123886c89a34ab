Over 50 secondary schools are expected to take part in the Nyanza Region Term Two games slated for June 14 to 16 at Cardinal Otunga High School in Kisii County. At least 120 referees, who will officiate the games will start a one-day coordination clinic on Tuesday at Mosocho grounds, while the teams are expected to arrive on Wednesday for the games. The games will bring together schools from Kisii, Nyamira, Siaya, Migori, Kisumu and Homa Bay counties as they slug it out in nine disciplines and slots in next month's National Games in Eldoret. Because of the high number of schools expected, Cardinal Otunga grounds will be the main venue, while other games will be played at Kisii High School. Schools will battle in under 19 and 16 football, volleyball, rugby sevens, netball, cross-country, heptathlon, decathlon and racquet games. Thomas Odhiambo, the Regional Secretary told Nation Sport said the high number of schools has been occasioned by the increase of disciplines following the abolishment of the Term Two A games. â€œIn last year's games, atleast 40 schools participated but since the changes in the calendar we now have more games," he said. He argued that the games have helped the region unearth several stars in football and volleyball.
