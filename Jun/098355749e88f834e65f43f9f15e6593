President Uhuru Kenyatta has issued a directive that will see all government entities publish full details of tenders from next month. According to a statement sent to newsrooms Wednesday, the executive order will allow members of the public to scrutinise details of deals including goods and services purchased, cost and suppliers. If complied with, this means taxpayers will also have access to information such as the owners and directors of supplier firms. "The Executive Order is premised on the Constitutional principles of Chapter 12 on public financial management, and in particular Art. 201 and 227 that emphasise integrity, prudent use of financial resources, and fair, equitable, competitive and cost effective procurement...This will enhance the highest level of public scrutiny at all units of public administration," the statement from State House says in part. In the latest twist to Mr Kenyatta's heightening war on corruption, the president also placed the onus of responsibility on respective procurement and finance officers in the event that graft is uncovered at their agencies. "As outlined in their respective letters of appointment, accounting officers shall take personal responsibility for all procurements in their agencies, and will be held personally accountable for all public resources under their charge." A similar order last week saw heads of procurement and accounting in ministries, departments and State-owned firms step aside ahead of a fresh vetting process. Mr Kenyatta has also charged Treasury Secretary Henry Rotich with the responsibility of ensuring the integrity of Ifmis, the software used to run the country’s financial system. The Integrated Financial Management Information System has been at the centre of several corruption scams.
