A storm is brewing at Nairobi County Assembly following a notice of motion calling for the impeachment of Speaker Beatrice Elachi. This comes after Waithaka MCA Anthony Kiragu Karanja drafted a motion that he is set to table before the assembly for debate but first it must be signed by 43 ward representatives. "We are regretting that the conduct of Elachi through her actions and omissions has caused the assembly great embarrassment and brought the office of the speaker into disrepute contrary to gamut of laws on conduct of state officers of her calibre. This assembly resolves to sanction and remove Hon. Elachi as holder of the office of speaker of Nairobi County Assembly," reads the notice of motion. Mr Karanja cites violation of Chapter Six of the Constitution, undermining the authority of County Assembly Service Board and abuse of office as grounds for his motion to impeach Speaker Elachi. The Waithaka ward representatives accuses Ms Elachi of partiality and alleged interference in procurement, accusations that the Speaker has denied. The motion also accuses the Speaker of inviting investigators to probe alleged irregularities in procurement, a function that should be carried out by the County Assembly Service Board. But Ms Elachi has denied inviting investigators to probe procurement irregularities, saying the sleuths came after a staff leaked the documents to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. Differences have recently emerged at the assembly between the Ms Elachi and county clerk, Mr Jacob Ngwele, resulting in a heated argument between the two on Thursday.
