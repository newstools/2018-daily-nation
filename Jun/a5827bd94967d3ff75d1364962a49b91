Two police officers were shot dead and another injured during an operation to recover stolen livestock in Daaba, Isiolo County, Isiolo North MP Hassan Oda Hulufo said. Isiolo County police boss Manase Musyoka was taken to a hospital in Nairobi after he was shot on the hip, the MP said on Monday evening. The incident comes barely three weeks after a police officer was shot dead by armed bandits during a botched joint operation to recover stolen cattle at Chumvi, Ngaremara location between regular and administration police from Isiolo. Top security officers in the county did not answer calls from Nation on Monday evening to comment on the incident. The MP regretted the incident saying the government should roll out an operation to completely disarm the bandits. "This is the second time the bandits have attacked and killed police officers. We are not going to tolerate bandits who have turned to be rebels and do not have respect for the rule of law or police officers," said the MP. He said insecurity is affecting the local economy.   Tension runs high, schools closed.
