The national football team Harambee Stars faces a herculean task in their qualifying battle for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. So far, the team has lost one match away to Sierra Leone in Group ‘F’ where they will also meet powerhouse Ghana and Ethiopia in the qualifying rounds. The Stars last qualified for the tournament 15 years ago. While we agree that it is important for the team to play friendly matches, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) needs to arrange for meaningful and quality matches. Harambee Stars, ranked 111th in the world, are currently in India for the Four Nations tournament that involves hosts India, New Zealand and Chinese Taipei, who are ranked 97th, 133rd and 122nd respectively. In March, the team drew 2-2 with Comoros (142) and lost to Central Africa Republic (115) 3-2. In May, Kenya lost to Swaziland (240) before beating Equatorial Guinea (145) 1-0. Clearly, Harambee Stars should not be meeting some of these teams since they do not help the players to improve at all. Ghana (50), Sierra Leone (103) and Ethiopia (146) will be tough nuts to crack.
