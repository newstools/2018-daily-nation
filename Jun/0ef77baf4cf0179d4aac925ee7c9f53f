The daring Wednesday morning raid at a coffee factory in Embu County in which 75 bags of the crop valued at Sh2.7 million were stolen is the latest pointer to a growing problem that calls for urgent action. The brazen theft of such a bulky consignment can only mean that there could be a ready market for the illicitly obtained coffee. A gang armed with metal bars and other crude weapons not only assaulted the lone guard at the factory, but also broke the padlocks to the store, carted away the coffee and loaded it on-to a lorry that was waiting nearly 200 metres away. It was a replay of similar robberies in the past in the coffee-growing region. Though village gangs are being used, the raids appear to have been well-planned by people who are able and well-versed in the logistics of transporting such commodities and who know exactly where they are delivering the cargo. In other words, these robberies are not spontaneous acts by village thieves. Several months ago, there were a number of similar incidents with the aggrieved farmers calling for the investigation of the managers of some coffee companies. Secondly, the police and the local authorities do not seem to have done enough to unravel this. Interestingly, the trucks carrying the illicit cargo apparently seamlessly go through the numerous police roadblocks along the highways. The officers manning the roadblocks should be demanding proof that this is not illicit cargo. There are far too many cartels profiteering at the expense of farmers, who invest a lot in terms of inputs and labour in growing the cash crops. The thefts must be stopped. The managers of coffee firms must have proper security arrangements instead of employing old men only armed with rungus. But, most importantly, the security agencies must pursue the culprits and have them punished.
