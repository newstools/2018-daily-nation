The bodies of victims of Tuesday’s air crash in the Aberdares were brought down from the mountainous crash site on Thursday evening. There were no survivors among the 10 passengers and crew members on the plane that crashed at the peak of the ranges. The black box of the plane was also recovered, officials said. Mr Pius Masai, the National Disaster Management Unity deputy director, said the bodies will be ferried to Nairobi's Lee Funeral Home by road for identification. Earlier Thursday, President Kenyatta mourned victims of the plane crash and at the same time pledged a full review and probe into the tragedy. “My thoughts and prayers are with the families, in this moment of grief. I pray that the families and friends of those we have lost may be granted the grace to endure this terrible loss,” the President said in a statement. The Cessna C208 aircraft, bound for Nairobi from Kitale, was operated by FlySax. On board were the pilot, Captain Barbra Wangeci Kamau, and First Officer and co-pilot Jean Mureithi. The eight passengers were Ahmed Ali Abdi, Karaba Sailah Waweru Muiga, Khetia Kishani, Matakasakaraia Thamani, Matakatekei Paula, Ngugi George Kinyua, Pinuertorn Ronald and Wafula Robinson.
