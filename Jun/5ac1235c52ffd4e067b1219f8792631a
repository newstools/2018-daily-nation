The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) destroyed fake goods worth Sh1.2 million seized in Kasarani, Nairobi, on Friday. In a press statement on Saturday, Commissioner for Intelligence and Strategic Operations James Githii Mburu said the products were seized in a residential house at Sports View Estate in the ongoing crackdown against the illegal business. "Among the products seized include 268 cartons of Heineken, 16 cartons of Faxes, eight cartons of Smirnoff whisky and four cartons of Turbog," he said. The multiagency team further confiscated eight cartons of Tusker can, three cartons of Guinness can, eight packets of 4th street, four packets of Cellar Cask as well as four packets of Johannisberg white. REVENUE The team includes the Interior Ministry, Kenya Bureau of Standards, National Authority for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse, Department of Public Health and National Police Service and the Anti-Counterfeit Agency.   In a separate operation on the same day, the officers seized 178 bottles of Turborg in Njiru Sub-County, Nairobi, in a truck. The driver is being held at Kayole Police Station awaiting to be arraignment next week. Mr Mburu urged Kenyans to support their efforts to end the harmful trade. "Recent studies indicate that many governments across the world have been losing billions of dollars to counterfeit products and illegitimate trade in the excisable goods sector," the statement reads.   The agency has raised alarm over an upsurge of condemned alcohol smuggled into Kenya.
