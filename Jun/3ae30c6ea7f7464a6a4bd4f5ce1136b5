When Esther Njoki saw her son-in-law George Ngugi Kinyua on Sunday last week, she did not have the faintest idea that he would be dead less than 48 hours later. According to Njoki, a resident of Rafiki village in Saboti Sub County, Trans-Nzoia County, Kinyua was a road contractor. He had travelled to Kapenguria on Monday before his death in the Tuesday evening plane tragedy. "He had a company contracted to build roads in West Pokot County,” Njoki told the Nation. “He had travelled there to supervise construction works before going back to Nairobi.” Njoki, whose elder daughter, Magdalene Wanjiru, was married to Kinyua, learnt about the missing plane from her daughter, who asked her “to pray for his safety”. But when news broke more than 40 hours later that none of those on board had survived, Njoki was overcome with grief, lamenting that the family had been robbed of their sole source of support. “My son-in-law visited us whenever he came to inspect the ongoing constructions. He has been paying tuition fees for my youngest daughter who is in school,” she said. Kinyua left behind his wife and three young children.   War songs and threats rock plans to ferry the remains out of Nyandarua.
