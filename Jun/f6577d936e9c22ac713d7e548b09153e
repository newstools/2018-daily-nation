Orange Democratic Movement party leader Raila Odinga Monday became the latest public figure to endorse NTV’s move to secure free-to-air broadcasting rights for the 2018 Fifa World Cup. Speaking at his office at Capitol Hill, Nairobi, an enthusiastic Odinga expressed delight with NTV’s partnership with Kwese Free Sports TV which allows the former to screen live matches of the world’s most popular sports event, and urged Kenyans to tune in and enjoy the 32 live World Cup games on the channel. Former Prime Minister Odinga, who steered clear of politics for the afternoon, recited, off-head, the World Cup winning teams from 1962 to 2014, before animatedly speaking about his favourite players and positions they played. His vast knowledge on football history both locally and internationally stunned his audience that included newly-appointed Nation Media Group Chief Executive Officer Stephen Gitagama, the group’s Broadcast Division Managing Director Alex Kobia, NMG’s Head of Head-Corporate and Regulatory Affairs Clifford Machoka and Kwese General Manager Monicah Ndung’u.   “I started supporting football passionately in 1962, and I was behind Brazil that year because of Pele,” he said. “Everybody knows that I support Germany. I am half German. I lived there for a long time and I have an obligation to be loyal to the team. Germany and Brazil are my teams, but I will be cheering all the African teams, starting with Nigeria, until they get eliminated. “I thank NTV for their efforts in ensuring that Kenyans can watch the games free of charge, and I urge everyone to tune in and enjoy the action,” the former Prime Minister said. NMG CEO Stephen Gitagama presented Odinga with the white German football team jersey together with the 2018 World cup official Fifa match ball, and he received complimentary copy of Raila’s latest book “Flame of Freedom”
