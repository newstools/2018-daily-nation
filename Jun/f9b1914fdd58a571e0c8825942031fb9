The National Assembly Education Committee wants principals to be held responsible whenever criminal acts take place in schools. The MPs also said only tutors registered with the Teachers Service Commission should support co-curricular activities in schools. They said that some people taken in by schools to train students usually mishandle the learners. The committee, chaired by Tinderet MP Julius Melly, also wants schools to set up teams that will assist in implementation, monitoring and evaluation of safety. IN-SERVICE TRAINING “The recurrence of danger in public secondary schools even after the release of the safety and standards manual by the Education Ministry poses questions that demand urgent answers. Insecurity in schools disrupts learning and leads to destruction of property and lives, thus putting the spotlight on teachers,” Mr Melly said during a briefing on school safety at Parliament Buildings on Tuesday. “Principals have been entrusted with children. They should be held responsible should the students come to any harm.” SAFETY MANUALS The MPs want the ministry to revise the safety manual for schools. According to the lawmakers, the ministry should insist on compulsory in-service disaster management training and encourage workshops on safety. The committee said it would put pressure on Education CS Amina Mohamed and her Interior counterpart Fred Matiang’i to ensure schools are safe.   Detectives are searching for the the 24-year-old teacher.
