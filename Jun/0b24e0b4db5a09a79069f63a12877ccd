The magistrate said the media was awash with cases of serious economic crimes, which pose serious threat to the financial health of the nation. He said such crimes might lead to anarchy and a threat to national security. Mr Ogoti said that the court has made plans for the speedy hearing of the cases, starting with a pre-trial conference tomorrow morning. The suspects, through their lawyers asked for a copy of the ruling to enable them appeal against the decision.  More follows.
