A multi-agency team has arrested two suspects in Mombasa and seized eight ivory tusks in the car they were travelling in. Acting on a tip-off, the officers drawn from the regular police and Kenya Wildlife Service set-up a road block at the Nyali Bridge to intercept the suspects. One of the suspects tried to escape after the police stopped the car they were travelling in but he was quickly arrested. A sniffer dog helped police nab the illegal consignment that was hidden in the car’s boot, rear seat and under the driver’s seat. The suspects were taken to Makupa Police Station where the Mombasa Urban OCPD Eliud Monari said they had been monitoring the vehicle since Friday. “On mid-morning on Saturday, my team acting on a tip-off intercepted this vehicle that had in it two people. We found that they were carrying eight pieces of elephant tusks,” said Mr Monari. Mr Monari said police are still hunting for more suspects they believe are behind the seized ivory “We highly believe that there are suspects who are connected to this cargo but are currently on the run. We will not rest until they are all brought to book,” said Mr Monari.
