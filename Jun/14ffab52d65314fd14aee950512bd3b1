Transport on Kisumu-Kakamega highway has been paralysed as boda boda and matatu operators clash in Kisumu. Trouble started on Friday night after boda boda riders burnt down a matatu claiming the driver had knocked down one of their colleagues. But on Saturday morning, matatu operators retaliated by burning down several motorcycles.
