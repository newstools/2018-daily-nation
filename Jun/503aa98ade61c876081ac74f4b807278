Five suspected cattle thieves have been arrested in Nguthuru village in Kandara, Murang’a County. Kandara OCPD Wilson Kosgey said the suspects were arrested on Sunday night while transporting a stolen dairy cow. Mr Kosgey the village is prone to cow theft that residents claim is perpetrated by a gang of seven. The gang allegedly transports the stolen cows in matatus. "I was transferred to this place less than a month ago and I have received complaints from the locals that they no longer rear livestock because they are usually stolen by a group of seven people. In fact, in this village of about 400 people, only 10 people keep livestock," the OCPD told the Nation.   Mr Kosgey said the gang comprises two school guards, a matatu owner, butcher, greengrocer and two others. "I have the list of all the butchers who buy the meat knowing too all well that it came from stolen cows and is not even inspected by veterinary officers,” said Mr Kosgey. The new police boss assured residents he will address their complaints, including slow police response when alerted of cow theft. "The Kabati area is known for all the wrong reasons from theft of Del Monte pineapples, to theft of avocados and highway robbery. The police must act swiftly whenever they are called upon but it seems some of my officers are in a comfort zone," Mr Kosgey said.
