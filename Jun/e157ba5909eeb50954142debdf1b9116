Nairobi-based businessman Allan Olela was on Tuesday rewarded with Sh20 million after striking the jackpot in the Betin competition. The 37-year-old trader becomes the fourth Betin winner of the climax cash prize having placed a bet of just Sh99 last week. "I've been playing with Betin for two years using as little as Sh100 bob. So last week I had a little extra cash so I thought I would give the jackpot a try during the World Cup. â€œWhen I saw my balance of Sh20 million, I thought it was a dream and had to call Betin to ask them if this was true," said Olela, a Gor Mahia, Manchester United and England national team supporter. He added: "I would advice anyone placing a bet not to use his salary or big amounts. This is something done with little money and, who knows, you could win a jackpot too." A father of one, who trades in electronics in Nairobi, Olela said he will use part of the money to buy a piece of land and build a house for his family. "Once I receive the money, I will put it in a fixed deposit for six months and, thereafter, see how best I can invest." Betin managing director Leandro Giovando congratulated the winner who was handed a dummy cheque of Sh20 million by the company's brand ambassador and Kenyan international McDonald Mariga. "We've seen a huge increase in participation in our jackpot category and are pleased to have another winner join our illustrious jackpot millionaires," said Leandro. Betin, launched in 2015, currently has over 100 retail outlets in the country.
