Police in Kipipiri, Nyandarua County, arrested 11 people suspected to be Mungiki adherents amid fears of a resurgence of the once-dreaded criminal gang. They had gathered at a home in Gitei when police, acting on a tip-off, rounded them up. A police officer involved in the Saturday evening raid said some of those apprehended had earlier been arrested for engaging in outlawed activities. "Some of those in our custody have pending court cases," said the senior officer. The suspects, according to one of the investigation officers, claimed they were organising a fundraiser. "We want to authenticate their claims before we arraign them in court," said the officer, who declined to named. Police further said the suspects might have been recruiting new members. In March, 2018, an equal number of suspects was arrested in the same area on suspicion of taking part in an oathing ceremony. Last month, Central Regional Coordinator Wilson Njenga directed his security team to start a major crackdown on re-emerging organised criminal gangs in the region. Mr Njenga said the crackdown on outlawed criminal gangs, would go hand in hand with the fight against illicit alcohol. Mungiki, a banned criminal gang, is greatly feared for its extreme violence.
