Police in Vihiga County are on high alert after a suspect linked to the Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF) was arrested. County Commissioner John Chelimo said the suspect, who had fled from Mt Elgon in Bungoma County, was working as a school watchman. "One of our schools, which I will not name, had already hired the suspect as its watchman. We have arrested him because he is among the people who are wanted in Mt Elgon," he said on Friday. Mr Chelimo said the school's administration had no idea the man was being sought over criminal activities in Mt Elgon. The group is accused of committing crimes such as murder and rape. INSECURITY Mr Chelimo called on Nyumba Kumi leaders to be vigilant. Governor Wilber Ottichilo also decried increased insecurity in the region. And to address the issue, Dr Ottichilo said his administration will this month set-up the county police authority. "Security is an important element. Our peace and security is now deteriorating. I will join hands with the county security team. Our people should also give information to the police," he said. "As the governor, the law empowers me to form a county police authority. I will launch it this month and it will have membership from all our five sub-counties." POLICE ACCUSED Village elders and Nyumba Kumi members in Sabatia have accused the police of abetting crime. They accused police officers of failing to respond to their tip-offs and alerts. "We are concerned that the police are not taking seriously the tips we give to them," elder Moses Magulu said during a baraza at Wodanga chief's camp. He went on: "They (police) just fuel their vehicles and move around. Instead of taking time to stop at the places we have told them they are used as hideouts, they just pass by."   The duo was charged with more than 100 counts of murder, rape and robbery with violence.
