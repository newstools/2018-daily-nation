Golf Park’s David Wakhu Tuesday produced a fine four under par 67 in day two of the “Road to Karen’’ event at the par 71 Muthaiga Golf Club course, to open a three-shot lead from Vet Lab’s Nelson Simwa. Wakhu managed to pick up four birdies at the tough front nine and two at the back nine with bogeys at the sixth and ninth holes to top the leaderboard with a two rounds total of one under par 141. Simwa on the other hand, fired two under par 69 having posted 75 in the first round, for a two rounds total of two over par 144. “I started badly, dropping a shot in the first hole but managed to get a number of birdie-putts in particularly at the first nine," said Simwa, who birdied the fourth, seventh and ninth and the last two holes at the back nine, while in addition to the first hole bogey, Simwa also dropped shots at the 11th and 16th. Chasing the two leaders was Mumias-based Dismas Indiza, who double-bogeyed the par four-15th after dropping a shot the hole, before for two over par 73 and a total of 145. “It was not a bad day though it could have been better if I didn’t drop two shots at the 15th," said Indiza, who made his two birdies for the day at the second and 17th holes. The third and final round of the 54-hole event which attracted 25 players, gets under way on Wednesday from 8am.
