Senior Nandi County government officials have gone underground as the anti-corruption watchdog intensifies crack-down on alleged misappropriation of billions of shillings for the last five years. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has pitched camp in the county for the last three days hunting for current and former officials linked to the loss of the funds through irregular road contracts and illegal tenders and procurements. MAJOR SEARCH The investigators carried out major search in the homes of the officials in Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia and Vihiga counties and confiscated vital documents including title deeds, electronic machines, tender and procurement documents among other personal items. Nandi County Police Commandant Patrick Wambani confirmed that the EACC team had sought their help in tracing some of the suspects implicated in fleecing public funds. OFFER SECURITY “Some police officers were assigned to offer security for the EACC officials during their search in homes of the suspects,” said Mr Wambani. The EACC sleuths visited the three residents of former Governor Dr Cleophas Lagat in the crack-down where the devolved unit is suspected to have lost billions of shillings between 2014 and 2018.   Governors seek to clean up image by containing bloated staff wage bills.
