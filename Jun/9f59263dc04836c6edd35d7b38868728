Kenya competed in the last leg of the 2017/18 World Rugby Sevens series in Paris last weekend without the sponsor logo on their jerseys. They concealed the ‘Make it Kenya’ logo during matches against New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, Argentina, Russia and Scotland in protest over a pay dispute between the players, Kenya Rugby Union and main sponsor, Brand Kenya. This was disappointing and embarrassing. The World Rugby Sevens series offers Kenya a unique platform to market itself as a sporting giant and tourism destination. That should be jealously guarded. BRAND KENYA Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) indicates that Brand Kenya had not wired the money before the team left for London two weeks ago, saying it would do so after the event. In case of a pay dispute, internal mechanisms should be used to resolve them to protect the reputation of the country. We should not wash our dirty linen in public. How did the KRU not foresee the protest and arrest the situation before it got out of hand? NATIONAL TEAM Actually, the arrogance with which some KRU directors have been handling national teams leaves a lot to be desired. Players and technical bench officials deserve respect. Sponsors, too, must be clear on what they are getting into to avoid corrupt dealings. However, considering the national interest, it was wrong for the Sevens team to protest in that manner.
