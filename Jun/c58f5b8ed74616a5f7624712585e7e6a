We congratulate Kenya’s Davis Cup team for its inspiring performance in Africa Group III Championships that ended on Saturday at the Nairobi Club. The team beat Benin 2-1 in the deciding match to enter the elite Euro/Africa Group II Championship next year after 13 years in the cold. Kenya narrowly missed out on promotion last year after falling to Zimbabwe 2-0 in an Africa Group III play-off. It was the first time Kenya hosted the Davis Cup since 2002, when it featured in Group II. It then dropped to Group III after it withdrew from both the Fed Cup and Davis Cup in 2006 due to a cash crunch. BEST PERFORMANCE Kenyans, who first played in the Davis Cup in 1974, staged their best performance to reach the Euro/Africa Group I semi-finals in 1992 but failed to qualify for the World Group. Tennis Kenya should be commended for the great work, but preparations for the Group II competition must start early. For instance, there is a need to have a full-time captain or coach with a proper training programme or the team. The team, whose average age is 18, is strong. It should be preserved and prepared properly if Kenya hope for a good showing in the tough Group II. MOTIVATE GROWTH The victory marked the success of the continuous junior player development but Tennis Kenya now needs to turn its focus on the senior level. The qualification comes soon after the country hosted International Tennis Federation president David Haggerty, who oversaw the ground-breaking for a modern tennis centre at Kasarani. This latest performance must motivate the growth of tennis in the country and help Kenya to recapture its past glory. Kenya needs affordable facilities to build a broad foundation for selection to national teams. This should help spur the sport’s growth.
