Police have seized over 2,000 bags of contraband sugar in a warehouse in Eastleigh, Nairobi. The 2,000 bags of brown sugar packed in 50kg bags were piled in the warehouse in Eastleigh Section Three. Mr Musa Yego, the head of the Flying Squad Unit, said they seized the bags of the brown sugar imported from Brazil after being tipped-off by members of the public. The sugar, Mr Yego said, was to be transported to to Mumias and Kabras sugar factories for refining but ended up in the hands of unscrupulous traders who have been selling it to unsuspecting members of the public. Mr Yego identified suspected traders behind the illegal business as three Kenyans of Somali origin. “As you can see the sugar is branded not fit for direct human consumption but these traders have been repackaging it before selling the sugar to unsuspecting members of the public and shops around here,” said Mr Yego. He said that the police also impounded cans of cooking oil, also not fit for consumption. The Flying Squad Unit boss said that three suspects, who have been operating the illegal business, will be arraigned in court on Tuesday morning. “The contraband goods will be destroyed under the instruction of the court,” Mr Yego said.
