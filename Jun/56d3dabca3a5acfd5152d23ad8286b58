Leaders in Tana River County have agitated for improved services at Hola County Referral Hospital. Speaking on Friday during Madaraka Day, Senator Juma Wario and Chewani ward representative Sauda Maiya Loda decried the hospitalâ€™s sorry state. "There is no hospital here. This hospital is completely rotten. The CEC member for health should either improve services at the hospital or close it down," Senator Wario said at Hola Stadium. Mr Juma cited an incident on Thursday night when the ambulance that was to take two boda boda operators who were involved in an accident to Malindi for specialised treatment lacked fuel. "I had to go out of my way to look for money at night to fuel the government ambulance for the young men to be rushed to Malindi. We cannot continue like this," he said. DEVELOPMENT Ms Loda said the county should cater for the needs of patients. They further want the drainage system in Hola town brushed-up. "Does clearing mathenge and sweeping the roads require any degree or diploma?" she posed, adding "Please employ our women and youth to clear the bushes and sweep the roads". She said the revenue collected by the county should be put into good use. DEBT In defence, Deputy Governor Salim Kea Batuyu said his administration is in financial throes following the debt they inherited from the local government. "As you are aware we inherited a huge debt which we have been struggling to repay. That is why we have some challenges in effectively delivering services to our residents, but we assure you that your concerns will be addressed," he said. Governor Dhadho Godhana is away in Berlin, Germany.
