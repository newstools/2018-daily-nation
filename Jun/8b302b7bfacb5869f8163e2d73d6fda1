Trans-Nzoia County government is on the spot over alleged corruption in the health sector that has led to loss of millions of shillings. Sections of the residents have consequently written to the Senate on alleged embezzlement of funds meant to improve health services. In their petition, they claim that millions of funds allocated to the health sector have been siphoned by corrupt individuals in the county government. “The county government has not been cooperative. This has led to delays in supplies and procurement,” said Mr Moses Zewedi one of the petitioners. FORENSIC AUDIT The petition dated June 6, 2018, was received by the clerk of Senate, Mr Jeremiah Nyegenye. It will be tabled before the Senate Committee of health. The petitioners have appealed to the senate to order a forensic audit and physical counting of instruments and equipment at Mt Elgon Hospital. They want the Senate to conduct an audit of all the finances allocated to the hospital against the authorised expenditures including the amount paid to doctors for services rendered. NECESSARY ACTION “We also demand for an audit of all revenue collected from level four hospitals,” said the petitioners. They also want the Senate to look into the construction of the county referral hospital to determine whether it meets the required standards. The Senate is set to discuss the petition forward to the Health Committee for necessary action.
