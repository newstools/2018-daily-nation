The government’s expenditure and net lending for the next financial year stands at Sh2.56 trillion. About Sh1.1 trillion will go towards ministerial recurrent expenditures, which includes Judiciary's Sh15 billion and Parliament's Sh36.8 billion to pay salaries for public servants. The biggest consumers in the recurrent expenditure include security, infrastructure, education and the sector drivers of the Big Four agenda. The development budget will get Sh671.6 billion, domestic bond redemptions Sh490.5 billion, county governments Sh314 billion, contingency fund Sh5 billion and Sh2.5 billion for net lending. TAXATION According to Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich, Sh1.95 trillion of the budget will be sourced directly from Kenyans through taxation, and Sh48.5 billion in grants. The deficit financing will be done through project loans at Sh235.8 billion, commercial financing Sh298.9 billion, programme support Sh2.5 billion, foreign payments Sh250.3 billion and domestic financing at Sh271 billion. Sh8.9 billion has been set aside for enhanced security operations, Sh29.8 billion for police and military modernisation, Sh3 billion for securitising borders and Sh9.2 billion for leasing of police vehicles. This comes as the CS downplayed fears that the ballooning public debt, which now stands at Sh5 trillion, is hazardous to the country. About Sh6.5 billion will go to police and prison officers’ medical insurance scheme and group life insurance for police. The CS also allocated Sh115.9 billion for ongoing road construction projects and Sh74.7 billion for phase 2A of the standard gauge railway. In education, Sh16 billion has been set aside for technical institutions. About Sh91.1 billion will support university education and Sh9.6 billion will go to the Higher Education Loans Board.
