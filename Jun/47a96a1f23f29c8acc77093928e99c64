A court in Kakamega has directed that a robbery with violence suspect be detained for five more days after a confusion emerged about his age. Senior principal magistrate Thomas Muraguri said this will allow police to conduct more investigations before the suspect is allowed to take a plea. The accused had claimed earlier he is a minor aged 17. But then he told the court he was born in 2000, which would make him 18. The investigating officer Stephen Juma asked the court to allow him more time to complete investigations. INVESTIGATIONS The investigating officer told court that the accused, together with five other suspects who were not in court,  committed the crime on the May 13, 2018 in Kakamega County. “The accused has been on the run for one month after the incident and was arrested yesterday and we present him to court today but seek for more time to complete investigations and place the accused on trial,” said Mr Juma. “I allow the application by the investigating officer seeking more time to conclude the investigations for a possible plea taking. The accused will be produced on Monday before court,” said the magistrate. The matter will be mentioned on June 18. Meanwhile, an inmate who had escaped from Shikusa Prison in Kakamega county under unclear circumstances last year was brought to court on Thursday morning.

In his mitigation, he said he was being assaulted by his fellow inmates while they were out in the field and whenever he reported the matter there was no action being taken. The convict was found at Malaba town in Busia county on May 23, 2018. “The accused is sentenced to serve one year in prison and has a right to appeal within 14 days,” said Mr Muraguri.
