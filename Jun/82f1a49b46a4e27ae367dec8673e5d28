The Kenya Rugby Union on Thursday sacked Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent "Namcos" Simiyu, Nation Sport has learnt. Simiyu sacking came just hours after Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala revealed that he had instructed Brand Kenya to cancel its eight-month Sh20million partnership with Kenya Rugby Union. The CS said the move was informed by Kenya Sevens players’ decision to conceal the branding of their shirt sponsor, Brand Kenya, during the Paris Sevens leg of the World Rugby Series on the weekend of June 9 and 10. Shujaa playing with Brand Kenya’s “Make It Kenya” message in front of their jerseys, concealed the message during all their matches at the Jean-Bouin Stadium in protest over a payment dispute between themselves, Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) and team sponsor Brand Kenya. It remains unclear whether the decision to sack the former Impala Saracens star was as a result of Balala's move. Our sources indicated that some officials at the Union met on Thursday and resolved to fire Simiyu, who was in his second season as Kenya Sevens coach. The source told Nation Sport that a disciplinary committee hearing on Wednesday failed to take place after Simiyu told the committee that he takes full responsibility of what happened in Paris Sevens where Kenya Sevens players concealed Brand Kenya message on their jerseys. "Simiyu's fate is already sealed and a statement should come out Friday morning," said the source. Efforts to reach KRU chairman Richard Omwela, Secretary General Oduor Gangla and CEO Ronald Bukusi for comments proved futile as their phones went unanswered. However, KRU general manager Thomas Odundo said he had "left some officials in a meeting at the Union but wasn't aware of the resolutions reached." Omwela had earlier on last week vowed to punish those behind the Paris Sevens debacle.   The CS said the team embarrassed the country by blocking the ‘Make it Kenya’ brand.
