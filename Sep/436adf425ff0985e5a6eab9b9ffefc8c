The World's strongest man on Friday toured Nairobi and wowed residents with his exceptional skills. After paying a courtesy call to Nairobi County Government's Sports Minister Janet Muthoni, Lithuanian Zydrunas Savickas used a rope to pull a 13-tonne fire engine for about 30 metres on a tarmacked road within the CBD. And to spice it up, the fire engine which belongs to the County government had been filled with 5000 litres of water. "I didn't even have to strain to pull this thing," the 43-year old bragged moments after. "Why? because I am used to pulling aeroplanes and heavier fire engines or buses," he added, whilst also suggesting his hesitation in sharing out the secret behind such power. Zydrunas is expected to perform at the Kenya Strongest Man Competition 2018 finals at the Nyayo stadium handball court on Sunday. This event, which is organised by Stealth Mark Africa, has so far attracted 16 competitors including defending champions Joseph Iroo, who is based in Qatar. Speaking at the event, Muthoni shared the County's plans to uplift the standard of sports in the country, including constructing four sports grounds in Dandora and Woodley, and renovating the City stadium.
