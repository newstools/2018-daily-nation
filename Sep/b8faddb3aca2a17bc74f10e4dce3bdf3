Women leaders will this week organise demonstrations over the killing of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno last week. Women Representatives Pamela Odhiambo (Migori), Ms Janet Ongera (Kisii), Ms Rosa Buyu (Kisumu) and Ms Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay) on Sunday visited Ms Otieno's family in Homa Bay and called for speedy investigations into her murder. They said the protests will be in solidarity with women who have been victims of violent relationships. "As women of Migori, we are angry and need to show this anger. We shall call all the women to come out and stage demonstrations in Migori County to demand quick justice for Sharon on Monday. Women are being murdered because of love triangles and family disagreements," Ms Odhiambo said. "We are saying as women, whatever the disagreements, no one should take the life of someone else. This has to stop." STABBEDMs Otieno was seven months pregnant when she was killed and her body dumped in a thicket in Oyugis, Homa Bay County, on Wednesday. She was abducted alongside Nation reporter Barrack Oduor who managed to escape by jumping out of a moving car. Ms Otieno, according to an autopsy report by Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor, was stabbed eight times leading to the death of the foetus. Dr Oduor said she died of excessive bleeding. Ms Buyu called on women to come out and demand justice for Ms Otieno. "We condemn the brutal murder of Sharon and demand quick probe into the murder. We call upon all women to castigate this killing," she said. SUSPECTS Ms Ongera urged detectives investigating the murder to ensure all the culprits are found and prosecuted, sentiments Ms Wanga emphasised. So far, Migori Governor Okoth Obado's personal assistant Michael Oyamo has been arraigned over the incident. Detectives are searching for at least seven suspects.
