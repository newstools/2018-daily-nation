Members of the Nakuru County Assembly want Deputy Speaker Samuel Tonui, who was arrested in connection with the ongoing clashes in Njoro, released from police custody. More than 25 ward representatives converged at Njoro Police Station on Saturday in a show of solidarity with the Nessuit MCA. NO VICTIMISATION They want him freed until the investigations are concluded. Mr Tonui was arrested on Friday evening after he was linked to the ethnic clashes in Nessuit and Marioshoni in Eastern Mau. Led by Majority Leader Stanley Karanja, the MCAs said Mr Tonui's continued detention will likely have a negative effect on peace efforts. "We are here to find out the reasons behind the arrest of our Deputy Speaker and to understand the process involved for him to be released on police bond. He has a health problem and needs medical attention," said Mr Karanja. He emphasised the role of leaders in efforts for sustainable peace and noted the need for them to be protected, not victimised. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS Mr Karanja said the MCAs will engage the county Directorate of Criminal Investigations to chart the way forward for the Speaker. Njoro ward representative Zackaria Kahoro expressed concern about the manner in which the matter is being handled, saying the detention is likely to result in negative perceptions among the warring people. The leaders donated foodstuff to displaced families camping at Home Craft grounds in Njoro. Five people have been confirmed dead in the clashes between two communities in Njoro and Molo while tens have been hospitalised with injuries. Two chiefs and a former MCA were also arrested.   Police say the victim was in a group that fired arrows during the clashes.
