Mr Mwangangi called for thorough investigations into the events that preceded the incident. "It is not bad to take students out for learning but those entrusted with their care should ensure their safety at all times," he said. Mr Mwangangi asked the national government and organisations such as the Kenya Red Cross Society to help with the retrieval of the bodies Mr Musembi Katuku, the Machakos Executive Secretary of the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet), said they were "shocked" when they were informed of the tragedy.
