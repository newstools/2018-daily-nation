Kenya’s Erick Maugo Shikuku was Thursday given a heroic welcome from Malaga, Spain, where he bagged two gold medals during the IAAF World Masters Athletics Championship. The 44 year-old Shikuku, who won the men's 40 years and over 5,000 and 10,000m walk events, was received at the Mombasa County Stadium by the County Lands and Housing Executive Edward Nyale. Nyale, who represented Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Sports Executive Munyoki Kyalo, said they were proud that one of their workers managed to win the medals in an international event and encouraged others to take sports seriously. “We want all sportsmen and women to come forward and train for they might also be lucky to represent the country in future international assignments,” he said. Shikuku said he was very happy to have won the medals in his first international attempt. “I’m very proud to have represented the country for the first time and emerged victorious in both the events I participated in,” he said. He said he would continue to train as he intends to take part in the 2019 Africa Masters Athletics Championship to be held in Tunisia. “I’m now aiming for the continental titles,” said Shikuku, who urged his peers to also train and fight to represent the country in the continental event.
