Police have arrested four suspects linked to drug trafficking at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi. The Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) on Thursday said two of the suspects, identified as Ms Mary Nyaguthie and Mr Bernard Otieno Oduor, had swallowed the drugs as they travelled on Tuesday. After being put under observation, the detectives said, Ms Nyaguthie and Mr Oduor emitted 13 and 18 pellets, respectively, on Wednesday. The officers added that the two suspects had swallowed the drugs with the aim of trafficking them. Ms Judith Otieno Odote and Mr Boaz Ouma were also arrested after they were suspected of being Ms Nyaguthie’s and Mr Oduor’s escorts. Police said the four will be arraigned on Friday once investigations are complete. DCI did not specify the kind of drug the detectives seized, only stating the narcotics were pellets. Last month, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i warned foreign drug dealers residing in Kenya that their days were numbered. Speaking during a meeting with regional security heads at the School of Government in Kabete, Dr Matiang’i said the dealers were using Kenyan women and girls as mules. “Drug dealers have come to Nairobi and they have confused our girls,” he said. “They live with them and when police come to arrest them (drug dealers), they claim they are married to a Kenyan. Marriage cannot be by word of mouth or by correspondence or by pretense. Marriage has to be proved in law.”   The narcotics originated from Mbarara, Uganda.
