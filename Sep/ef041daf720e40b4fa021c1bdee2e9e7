Wednesday's SportPesa Premier League match between Bandari and visiting Sofapaka FC failed to kick off following heavy rains that pounded the coastal city of Mombasa. Mbaraki Sports Club grounds, the venue of the match, was flooded with water making it unplayable, prompting match officials to put off the match to Thursday morning. The match officials in consultation with the teams’ officials agreed that the match be played at the same ground from 9am. “We expect the situation to improve and the ground to be in playable condition tomorrow (Thursday),” said Bandari FC spokesman Salim Sumra. Admiral Youth FC Technical Director, Aref Baghazally said it was shameful that the city has no modern stadium to avoid such scenarios. “We should be ashamed for postponing this match today because the ground is in an unplayable condition. Why are we failing to have a modern stadium when small towns like Machakos and Meru have stadiums which can host big matches?,” posed Baghazally.   Victory for Tusker takes their points tally to 50.
