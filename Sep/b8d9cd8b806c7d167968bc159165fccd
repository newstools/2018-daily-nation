Just when a sustained countrywide campaign against HIV appeared to be yielding dividends, there is a shocking development: The Ministry of Health has sounded the alarm about an increase in new HIV infections among youth. As the ministry rightly says, this is a serious drawback in the fight against the disease and definitely calls for a thorough review to find out what could have gone wrong. According to Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki, more than 40 per cent of all the new infections are occurring among adolescents aged 14 to 24. This should worry us all, considering that this is a key demographic of our population. Youth, of course, is a dependent segment that accounts for some 20 per cent of the population. NO CURE It is the least productive and most burdensome group as these young people are mostly in school or college and education gobbles up a sizeable portion of the national and county budgets. What is ironical, however, is that this section of the population is also well-informed and knowledgeable. One would have expected youth to be more aware about the Aids scourge, being daily exposed to an avalanche of information in mainstream and social media. They must be aware, first and foremost, that there is no cure for Aids. It’s inconceivable, therefore, that there is anyone in this group who does not know that Aids is a major killer. ROBUST CAMPAIGN The message about avoiding risky sexual behaviour has inundated the media with a robust campaign on abstention, faithfulness and the use of condoms — the ‘ABC’ of prevention. Since youth is the future of the nation, the rise in infections among them is a wake-up call to reinvigorate the HIV/Aids awareness campaign. The National Aids Control Council and other agencies must step up their cooperation with non-governmental organisations to repackage the message to youth and help reduce the spread of HIV/Aids.
