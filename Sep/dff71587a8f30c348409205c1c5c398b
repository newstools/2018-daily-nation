Ugandan singer Jose Chameleone has announced the end of his marriage with Daniella Atim. Chameleone, whose real name is Joseph Mayanja, posted on his social media pages that he had to make a decision, however heartbreaking it is. The celebrated musician said that he is now a single man, although not searching. "I let you be Daniella. God bless you always. I can’t prove myself more than I have," he wrote. Daniella, who has been married to the singer for nine years, filed for divorce in 2017. She accused her husband of cruelty, saying he would beat and humiliate her even in the presence of their five children. Daniella added that she had persevered since 2013. ASSAULT In her petition, Daniella said Chameleone resorted to binge drinking that culminated into him beating her, forcing her to seek refuge at her friends’ places. "On or about 2013, the respondent (Chameleone) started molesting the petitioner (Daniella) with no reasonable cause and the acts of the molestation have continued to date," Daniella said in her divorce suit before Nakawa Court. She explained that because of the severe beatings she sometimes had to cover her face to conceal the wounds and scars inflicted on her. "The respondent’s (Chameleone) violent behaviour has drastically affected the health of your petitioner (Daniella) because of the constant beating, and your petitioner cannot even sleep at night worrying that the respondent (Chameleone) may kill her," Daniella added in her divorce suit.
