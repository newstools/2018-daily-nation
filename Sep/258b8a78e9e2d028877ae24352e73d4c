Police in Taita Taveta have recovered Sh5 million of the sh21 million believed to have been stolen from Kenya Commercial Bank's Wundanyi branch. Detectives recovered the money after two employees were arrested on Friday last week. KEY DETAILS Mr Peter Ngoda and Mr Benedict Mativo were in charge of KCB’s strong room keys and code when it was found that the money was missing. Wundanyi police boss Richard Cheruiyot confirmed that the money had been recovered but did not say where it was found. Police sources, however, told the Nation that it was found in Kitui County. “Huge amounts of money were stolen. We are still investigating so we cannot reveal some information,” Mr Cheruiyot said. On Monday, the two suspects were arraigned at Wundanyi Law Courts but Resident Magistrate Emily Nyakundi ordered their detention for five more days. At the time, Ms Nyakundi said the extension would allow the prosecution to collect more evidence. The order was issued after prosecution council Jethron Okumu petitioned the court, arguing that investigations had indicated the possible recovery of the money. The two employees, who are being held at Wundanyi Police Station, will be arraigned on Friday.   The three will each spend eight years in prison.
