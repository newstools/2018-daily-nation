Police have arrested two suspects for allegedly kidnapping a man at Kinoo, Kiambu County, pouring acid on his face and chopping off his private parts. One of the suspects, Ms Eva Wangari Wachuka, who had changed her name to Margaret Njoki Ngigi was arrested on Friday while attending a job interview at Tandoori Resort in Diani, Kwale County. Her suspected accomplice Mr Joshua Ngugi was arrested in Nairobi. A third suspect is still at large over the gruesome attack on the man that allegedly occurred on August 28 this year. The suspects will be arraigned in Nairobi on Monday. One of the investigating officers said the victim is a former boyfriend of Ms Wachuka. The officer said Ms Wachuka drugged the victim and took him to her house where at about 2am, the two other suspects joined her, poured acid on the man's eyes and robbed him off of everything in his possession. The officer said Ms Wachuka then chopped off his manhood and threw it in the toilet. The victim is receiving treatment at Kenyatta National Hospital.
