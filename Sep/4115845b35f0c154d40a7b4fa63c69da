Detectives on Friday arrested two men who were found in possession of 36 kilogrammes of ivory at Kambu Market in Makueni County. Mr Paul Masela, the head of communication at the Kenya Wildlife Service, said the suspects fell into a police trap while looking for a buyer for their commodities at the market. The two were locked up at Mtito Andei Police Station, according to Kibwezi police boss Ben Changulo. “We have launched investigations to establish the origin of the ivory before the suspects are taken to court,” said Mr Masela. Last month, three suspected ivory traders were arrested in possession of ivory and other wildlife trophies worth Sh 46 million around the same area.   Police arrested a foreigner with 19.5 kilograms of ivory as she attempted to leave Kenya on Christmas Day.
