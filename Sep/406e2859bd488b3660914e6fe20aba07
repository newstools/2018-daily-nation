Eliud Kipchoge and Gladys Cherono on Sunday put Kenya on the world map with their stellar performances in the 45th edition of the Berlin Marathon. Kipchoge shattered the world marathon record after running a brilliant race, clocking 2 hours, 1 minute and 39 seconds to retain the Berlin men’s title. Cherono, on the other hand, claimed a hat-trick of titles in the women’s race, winning in a course record and personal best time of 2 hours, 18 minutes and 11 seconds. DOPING CLAIMS The two athletes’ enviable achievements saw their fellow Kenyans, led by President Uhuru Kenyatta, unite in celebrating them. Kipchoge’s exploits come at a time when Kenyan athletics has made the headlines for the wrong reasons with the revelation of doping claims among some elite athletes and the life ban of a former official for graft. However, the 33-year-old Olympic champion has proved that success can be achieved running clean. SHORT-CUTS At a time when many up-and-coming athletes would rather find short-cuts to gain success and fame, Kipchoge’s hard work and integrity have propelled him to greatness. Younger sportsmen and women should draw inspiration from Kipchoge and strive to follow in his footsteps by simply working hard and maintaining honesty. They can also make an honest living out of sports.
