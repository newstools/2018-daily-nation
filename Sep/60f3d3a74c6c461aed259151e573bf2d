Two Jubilee Party MPs have appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich. Chuka Igamba Ng’ombe MP Patrick Munene and his Runyenjes counterpart Mr Eric Muchangi have accused Mr Rotich of presiding over 'poor monetary policies'. The lawmakers blamed Mr Rotich for the current ‘economic crisis’ that has seen government introduce a new tax on fuel and petroleum products and demanded his immediate resignation. Speaking in Embu town on Saturday, the MPs said they would introduce the issue of Mr Rotich's impeachment when the National Assembly holds a special session on Tuesday. IMPEACHMENT “Before Parliament went on recess, there was a bill to impeach Mr Rotich. He has been inefficient. As a leader, he knows that he has failed and he should step down,” said Mr Munene. Mr Muchangi said Mr Rotich should take personal responsibility over the leadership in his ministry “because it has not been doing well”. READ: MPs will feel pain in Uhuru austerity plan Mr Munene accused Mr Rotich of being keen to implement and policies set by International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. “If you look at the monetary policies he is bringing, you will see that the Treasury is being led by people whose loyalty lies with IMF. Is it a coincidence most senior officers at the Treasury came from IMF?” he posed. CONFLICTING OPINIONS Mr Munene at the same time warned the National Assembly against holding predetermined debates where those with conflicting opinions are often ignored. “Today, there are predetermined debates. You come to Parliament and there is a list of MPs who will contribute because they are known to support the outcome that is expected. The House leadership should give all legislators a chance to speak their mind,” he said.   Treasury Secretary Henry Rotich presented budget statement for the 2018/19 year.
