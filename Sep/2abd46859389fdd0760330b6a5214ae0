Migori Governor Okoth Obado will remain in remand until Thursday when the court will rule on his bail application. Mr Obado on Tusday urged the High Court to release him on bail saying there is no compelling reason to deny him his freedom. While appearing before Justice Jessie Lessit this afternoon, Mr Obado who denied murdering 26-year-old Sharon Otieno, said he will abide by any conditions placed by the court. Through lawyer Nicholas Ombija, Mr Obado said it is not sufficient to demonstrate that he is a Governor but the court must be given compelling reason to deny him bail. He further said the allegations that some witnesses have been threatened has not been linked to him. Mr Obado said he has the right to bail and having a strong case, as alleged by the prosecution, is not compelling reason. But in opposition, the prosecution said the right to bail is not absolute. Through Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Jacob Ondari, the prosecution said Mr Obado is influential person and most of the witnesses in the case come from Migori. Ms Otieno was murdered between September 3 and 4 in Homa Bay county.   Auma is yet to come to terms with the tragic death of her daughter.
