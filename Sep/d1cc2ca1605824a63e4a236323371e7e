We did not need a World Bank study to remind managers of African cities about their appalling inability to handle their garbage. There is glaring evidence of this everywhere. In most towns, one comes across mounds of rotting rubbish not only in the residential areas but also in the central business districts. Of course, the situation is worse in the mushrooming informal settlements, where growing populations wallow in abject poverty. In Nairobi, the city’s rapid growth has outstripped the ability to regularly collect the increasing garbage. According to the World Bank report, ‘What a waste!’, Nairobi collects only half of its household rubbish, which is then just trucked across the city to a dumpsite in the Eastlands and piled up in the open. That just amounts to transferring the problem from other parts of the city to this dumpsite, where mountains of garbage are discarded to continue rotting. With absolutely no recycling, this has spawned a dirty enterprise where poor scavengers rummage through the litter daily hoping to salvage something of a little value. The woeful situation just confirms the inability of the leadership to meet the challenges of growing urbanisation. However, we hope they will be alarmed enough about the warning in the new report, that African cities risk drowning in garbage in the near future. Failure to collect and properly dispose of litter is polluting the environment and exposing residents to epidemics. Burning the rubbish, as happens in Nairobi’s dumpsite, just worsens the situation. There is increasing evidence of residents complaining about respiratory tract infections. This is unacceptable and borders on criminal negligence by the city managers as the solution is obvious. There is a need to streamline garbage collection and create and enhance the ability to recycle it and maintain a clean environment.
