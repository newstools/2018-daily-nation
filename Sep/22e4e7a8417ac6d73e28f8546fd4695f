Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to suspend the 16 percent value added tax on petroleum products to cushion Kenyans from the high cost of living. Governor Joho instead advised the government to seek better alternatives of increasing revenue. "I have noted with concern the suffering Kenyans are being subjected to following the increase in fuel prices after introduction of the controversial value added tax of 16 percent," Mr Joho said in a press statement Monday. He said Kenyans are already overburdened by low earnings, unemployment and inflation. "This would further worsen their livelihoods. While keenly aware of our international and domestic financial obligations, I wish to urge the President to assent to the Finance Amendment Bill that suspends the implementation of this tax," he said. He urged the National Treasury to revisit the matter. Mr Joho's remarks follow complaints by Kenyans opposing the tax. For example, travellers, including schoolgoing children, were stranded at different bus stops in Mombasa after some matatus boycotted work over the tax.   Passengers, including school children, stranded in Mombasa.
