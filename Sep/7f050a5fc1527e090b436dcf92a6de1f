Kenyatta University student Phillip Kimani overcame 150 competitors to claim the Jumia Fifa gaming tournament, at the Thika Road Mall, on Saturday. Kimani secured a 2-1 aggregate (decided on golden goal rule after 1-1 draw in first leg) victory over Boniface Maina to walk away with the prestigious trophy and Sh50,000 in prize money. Maina received Sh10,000, while second runners up Joseph Macharia pocketed Sh5,000 in the one-day inaugural event. "I'm extremely happy to be the first winner of this Fifa tournament. It's a great feeling having beaten one of the toughest opponents in the final. I'm truly lost for words, but it's my hope that I will keep getting better and better," said Kimani. "It's a very tough game. It reached a point I almost gave up, but I kept holding on until I won it. This is the best event I have seen so far: from display to features. "I will use the money to buy a console to help me continue practising in order to win in future events. Research shows that many people abroad have taken Fifa gaming as a career, winning large amount of money. I think here in Kenya, we are also on the right path." Fans, who turned out in large numbers, were also not left out as lucky ruffle tickets winners went back home with give-aways.
