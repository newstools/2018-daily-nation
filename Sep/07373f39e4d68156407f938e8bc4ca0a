Narok County Police Commander Thomas Ngeiwua said the chaos erupted at Nkoben and Chepalungu villages in the Maasai Mau Forest where one man was killed. Mr Ngeiwua said 67 goats that were stolen have been recovered.   “Some of the raiders drove the stolen animals towards Chepalungu, Center 1 and Kipchoge where eviction of settlers has been going on,” he added. Top security officials held a crisis meeting to address the clashes that have displaced hundreds of residents living on the edge of Mau forest. The fighting started when members of the one community went on a revenge mission after one of their kin was killed by youths from another community.
