Lawyers appearing before the lower courts in the country will not be required to wear the legal profession’s vestments, registrar of the magistrates courts Peter Mulwa has said. Mr Mulwa, in a memo addressed to all magistrates, indicated that a section of magistrates were forcing lawyers to be robed, according to Kenya’s legal profession code of dress, while in open courtroom. He noted that some magistrates had gone to the extent of denying audience to lawyers who are not wearing the vestments. Recently, the Judiciary issued all chief magistrates, senior principal magistrates and a few principal magistrates with robes for use in open courtrooms. DENIED AUDIENCE “We are aware of some unfortunate developments where some magistrates have gone ahead to require that advocates appearing in their courts be robed. And that in some instances counsel have been denied audience for failure to robe,” said Mr Mulwa. He instructed the magistrates who had issued the directives to withdraw them with immediate effect and in writing. “Kindly note that our issuance of robes did not come with a requirement that advocates be required to robe in those courts,” Mr Mulwa told the magistrates.
