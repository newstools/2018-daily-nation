A court in Wajir postponed hearing of a gang-rape case after a witness failed to turn up. Wajir Senior Resident Magistrate Amos Makoror adjourned the case on Friday to November 9 when the witness is expected to be back in the country. The court was told that  the witness is currently outside of the country for a work training.  outside the county. The victim, who is  a Form One student was gang-raped for three consecutive days early this year and was left in  in a critical condition. She was flown to Nairobi for medical treatment. A day after the incident occurred, a man was arrested in Habaswein, but his two accomplices escaped to Somalia. The family lawyer said the two other suspects were arrested in Kismayu by Somalia authorities but have not been extradited to Kenya, but Habaswein police boss Benjamin Kimwele denied the claims. An attempt by elders to initiate an alternative dispute resolution system (maslaha) failed amid calls for the case to be prosecuted quickly. Recently, the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i warned chiefs against using the maslaha system to settle rape cases.   She suffered serious injuries and was airlifted to Nairobi.
