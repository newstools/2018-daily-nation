Football Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa has withdrawn his candidature for the African representative to the Fifa Council Member for the Anglophone linguistic grouping at the last minute. Mwendwa, Nation Sport understands, made the decision to step down on Sunday morning, hours before the vote that is expected to be held at the Caf Congress in Cairo. "Yes, I have (stepped down)," he confirmed. "The politics on the floor were not right at this point." The youthful administrator's withdrawal leaves four other candidates in the race namely Tanzanian Leodgar Tenga, South Africa FA president Danny Jordan, Elvis Chetty from Seychelles and Malawi's Walter Nyamilandu - who is considered favourite. Mwendwa's withdrawal is rather surprising, considering just a few weeks ago he shared his exclusive vision for the role with Nation Sport. He said: "I am qualified and experienced to perform this role as an advisor to the Fifa president." "Those saying I am young should know that it is an advantage. I have more energy to move around and help football grow in Africa." "In Africa, our main challenge is with youth football, grassroots football and coaching. This is where we need to improve. It is where I will look into."   Seychelles FA president Elvis Chetty also stepped down on the day of the election.
