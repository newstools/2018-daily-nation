Three people, among them a 13-year-old girl, were killed on Thursday night by bandits at Kasawan in Tiaty Sub-County, on the border of Elgeyo-Marakwet and Baringo counties. The midnight incident happened when three armed criminals descended on a family, shot them and left without stealing anything. Confirming the incident, Kolowa division assistant county commissioner Rodgers Ochieng said that the armed criminals who are suspected to be from the Elgeyo Maraket County carried out the attack. “We were informed at midnight that some criminals had attacked a family in Tirioko ward. We went to the scene and found that a woman and her son who had been shot had already died but a 13-year-old girl who had gunshot wounds was still alive. We rushed the girl to Kolowa Dispensary for first aid but unfortunately she succumbed to the injuries on the way,” said Mr Ochieng. He said that the body of the teenage girl is at Kolowa dispensary while the other two are still at the scene. The incident comes barely a week after a police officer and two national police reservists (NPR) were seriously injured in a daring banditry attack in Ramacha village in Baringo South Sub-County. The Saturday afternoon attack happened when locals who were clearing land were ambushed by the armed criminals who shot at them, seriously injuring the trio. Two weeks ago, armed bandits struck the Tuluk village in Baringo North and made away with more than 100 goats and abducted a herder.   Schools have been deserted with no police officers in sight to protect residents.
