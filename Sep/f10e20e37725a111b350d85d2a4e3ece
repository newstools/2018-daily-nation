Overnight leader Dismas Indiza recovered from three early bogey scare and Zambian Dyne Moore’s charge, to finally maintain his lead with a two rounds total of nine under par 133 in day two of this year’s Uganda Open golf championship at the par 71 Entebbe Golf Club course on Thursday. No doubt one of the most experienced player in the tournament, the long-hitting Indiza got off with a birdie at the first hole and parred the second hole. He however picked up three successive bogeys from the third, recovered one at the sixth, but dropped two more shots at the seventh and eighth. Moore, on the other hand was firing home by picking up a birdie after a birdie and it looked the end of the road for Indiza. But like he always says Mungu yuko (God is there, Indiza, starving for more birdies, blasted five of them in a row from the 11th to the 15th and closed the day’s work with a fine birdie at the 18th for the day’s six under par 65, so far the lowest, for a three shots lead going into Friday’s third round. Meanwhile, Moore, from Nkana Golf Club in Kitwe, birdied the seventh and ninth at the front nine, before adding three more at the 12th, 13th and 18th, but had birdied the 10th, 15th and 16th to sign for a 67, which gave him a total of six under par 136. Closing the day just a shot behind Moore, was Kenyan Greg Snow, who produced six birdies and three bogeys for three under par 68, which gave him a two day total of 137, which puts him in a striking position to top in the remaining two rounds of the Castle Lite sponsored event, where at stake is $50,000 (about Sh5 million). The best Ugandan so far is Happy Robert, who shot two under par 69 for a total of one under par 141 in fifth place, behind Kenya’s Simon Ngige, who also carded 69 for the day. Ngige birdied the fifth, sixth, 11th, 12th, 14th and 18th, but against bogeys on the second, seventh, eighth and 15th holes. A total of 30 Kenyans out of the field of 98 professionals drawn from different parts of the country, travelled to Entebbe for this year’s event, where the top 30 and ties (excluding leading amateur Ronald Otile of Uganda), were within the projected seven over par cut.
