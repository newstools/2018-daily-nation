Hi Brenda, My friend sometimes borrows money from me, and I lend her when I can. But when she pays back through M-Pesa, she does not add withdrawal fees. I think it is rude, but I don’t want to look petty by bringing it up. How do I bring up the topic?  It is rude. Bring it up. If she is your friend, she will understand that the thing she is doing is immensely irritating. There is a certain etiquette in lending and borrowing of money. Consideration is key – if someone lends you money, give it back when you said you would, and don't let them chase you for it. If possible, add a small token on top, of appreciation, if you can. And, if they send you money by M-Pesa, consider also the fact that it cost them to send it to you, what with the cost of fuel in this economy and the new M-Pesa charges. Your pal will probably appreciate your honesty after she gets pissed – most people are touchy about money fees. But ask her if she would have preferred that you keep your irritation to yourself and fume, resulting in it affecting your friendship, and thereby poisoning it from the inside out. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   The best you can do is apologise to them as well.
