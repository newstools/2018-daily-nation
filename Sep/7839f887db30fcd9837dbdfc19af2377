Wazito coach Frank Ouna has vowed to return the team to the SportPesa Premier League within a season. Wednesday's 2-1 loss to Kariobangi Sharks in Machakos confirmed Wazito's relegation to the second tier National Super League after only one season in the top flight. But then Ouna, who has also managed Gor Mahia and Kenya before, is positive about Wazito's future. "Overall this was an important learning experience. I have to appreciate my boys, they played some very good football and were dedicated all through. The management too really sacrificed and helped us along the way. We, however, came short ultimately but there is the chance of a comeback," said Ouna. "The plan is to make a comeback as soon as possible. Remain positive, commence preparations and begin next season strongly with aim of making it back to the top flight. For sure, we will be making some significant changes to our squad with the aim of strengthening it even at this lower level." Wazito won seven games and drew three out of 32 matches, picking up 28 points. Also relegated are erratic Thika United. Wazito are credited with helping nurture Pistone Mutamba, the gangly forward who has been called up several times Harambee Stars by coach Sebastian Migne.   The result sees Chemelil remain third from bottom.
