A student said to have fallen in River Mathioya near Michuki Technical Training Institute has on Monday been found dead. Ms Linnet Wanjiku, 18, was on Saturday in the company of another student, believed to be her lover, who claimed she fell in the river after he was pushed by other students on Sunday night to reveal her whereabouts. SEARCH The institute’s principal, Mr John Gitonga, said he got to know that the student fell in the river on Sunday and contacted the authorities while a search commenced the same night. “I have not yet understood why the male student failed to inform the school management that his colleague had fallen in the river but the matter will be investigated by the police,” he said. Mr Gitonga added that the student joined the institution last month to pursue a course in hair dressing. According to Kangema Deputy County Commissioner Agnes Karoki, investigations to establish the cause of the student’s death have commenced and more will be unravelled after a postmortem is conducted. “More will be established after a postmortem is conducted but we have already started the investigations to know what the two were doing and why the male student failed to immediately notify the school management and the authorities,” Ms Karoki said. INVESTIGATIONS The search involved all students who joined forces to search for their colleague hoping to find her alive, but their hopes were dimmed when they found the body floating on the river. The student’s described the deceased as kind, generous and accommodative as they called on the police to fast-track investigations to find out what caused her death. "Ms Wanjiku was very calm and welcoming, we want the police to do all what they can to find out whether there was foul play in the student's death," Mr John Mwangi, a student said.   The principal says the students fell into the river while playing.
