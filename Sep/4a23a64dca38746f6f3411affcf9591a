Kenya’s Daniel Kipchumba swept to victory at Copenhagen Half Marathon, crushing compatriot Abraham Kiptum and Ethiopian Jemal Yimer Mekonnen in a thrilling sprint finish in the Denmark capital on Sunday. Kipchumba clocked 59 minutes and 06 seconds to triumph, beating Kiptum to second place by three seconds, as Mekonnen claimed the last podium place in 59:14. Double world 3000m indoor champion, Yomif Kejelcha, finished fourth on his debut in a time of 59:17, as the top eight men finished inside 60 minutes. World 1,500m silver medallist Sifan Hassan from the Netherlands, who was competing in her first half marathon race, broke the European half marathon record in winning the women’s race in 65:15. Ethiopian-born Hassan, who won the European 5000m gold in August, bettered the previous record by one minute and 10 seconds. Fellow Dutch athlete Lornah Kiplagat, who like Hassan was born in East Africa, held the record of 66:25 since 2007. Eight women too dipped under 68 minutes. “It was really hard and I always thought I would die, but I’m really happy and proud of my result,” Hassan told www.fastrunning.com after her performance, which ranks her eighth on the world all-time list. “The pace was so hard, but I just kept coming back.” Ethiopia’s Ababel Yeshaneh finished second in 65:46, ahead of race favourite Joan Chelimo of Kenya who clocked 66:15.
