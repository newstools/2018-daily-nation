Communication masts destroyed by Somalia based Al-Shabaab militant group have been restored in Ijara and Fafi in Garissa County. Locals welcomed the move saying crucial services such as mobile money transfer, businesses and free flow of information had been crippled. "We are very happy now that services have resumed. We can now do business and also reopen M-Pesa shops that were closed following destruction of Safaricom masts," Mr Abdi Mohamud, an Ijara resident, said. Residents had to travel far to access network. TERRORISMPolice officers from the Rapid Deployment Unit have been guarding the mast in Ijara town. Ijara MP Sophia Abdinoor said local leaders have been working hard to have the services restored and fight terror. "We have made everything possible. We have built toilets and also given water tanks to the police officers posted to guard the communication masts," Mrs Abdinoor said. Mrs Abdinoor appealed to the government to post more security officers to weed out criminals. "We also want more National Police Reservists to be deployed to guard these installations. We have been affected by lack of communication." SECURITYNorth Eastern Regional Commissioner Mohamed Birik said that telecommunication masts across the region will be given extra security since they have become vulnerable to attacks. "We will not take chances this time round. We want to make sure that we protect all the masts from wherever they have been erected in the region. This is because they also assist in security," he said.   Attackers also torch social hall.
