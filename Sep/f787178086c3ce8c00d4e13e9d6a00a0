Muthaiga Golf Club’s Greg Snow got off to a flying start, firing three under par 69 in the opening round of the second leg of the Safari Tour at the par 72 Vet Lab Sports Club on Sunday. He birdied the first, sixth, 10th, 14th, and 18th with an eagle three at the seventh though he also dropped shots over the second, third, 11th and 17th, for a narrow one shot lead from Sigona’s Sujan Shah, who who made three birdies, an eagle and three bogeys for his two under par 70. Three others tied for the third place on one under par 71. They included local pro Nelson Simwa, whose round included five birdies and four bogeys. The others were Muthaiga’s Nelson Mudanyi and Sigona’s John Wangai, who together had a total of nine birdies though each one also dropped a number of shots for the day. Greg said that there was still more work left for him to better his score, adding that he is looking forward to the next three rounds to improve. “It was a good opening round today; I had a lot of chances to make more birdies and I feel like I could have gotten a few more out there but generally it was a good round. I have proved that I can play well, and picking up from Nyali, I want to continue with this momentum for the remainder of the leg,” he said. A total of 41 professionals including five from Tanzania and one from Uganda, are participating in the four rounds event where at stake is Sh1 million. Monday's second round is set for 9am, a round which will decide the top 20 and ties who proceed to the last two rounds on Tuesday and Wednesday.   The four carded a combined score of 87 points.
