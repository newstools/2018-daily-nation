Mombasa County has stepped up efforts to cut down the consumption of a popular stimulant by targeting traders with hefty taxes. The county has increased offloading fees for "muguka" leaves from Sh28,000 to Sh38,000 for a seven-tonne lorry and above, Sh20,000 up from Sh14,000 for vehicles below seven tonnes, and Sh6,400 up from Sh5,000 for a canter or a three-tonne lorry. HEALTH More than 2,000 traders, farmers and other stakeholders, including transporters, are up in arms over the increase, which is contained in the 2018/2019 Finance Bill. “Since the (ban) motion did not pass, we decided to use the Finance Bill to control the sale and consumption of muguka,” nominated ward representative Fatma Kushe told Nation. County communication director Richard Chacha defended the bill saying it will discourage sale and consumption of muguka. “We want to discourage the chewing of muguka because of its health effects. It’s not that we want money, it’s a prohibitive measure. There’s public participation on Saturday where anyone with reservations can air their views,” Mr Chacha said. DEMOLITION Last month, an effort to ban the trade was thwarted after a section of the ward representatives opposed the move. The assembly's Health Committee, led by deputy chairperson Ms Kushe, said the product has negatively impacted the health and well-being of the youth in the region. They claimed that the drug, derived from the “muguka” plant and consumed as fresh leaves, is also threatening marriages because of cases of absentee and irresponsible husbands. More than 100 structures at Tononoka market where the business is carried out were demolished.
