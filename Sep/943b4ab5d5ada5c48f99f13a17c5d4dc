Little-known Storms caused the biggest upset in local basketball Sunday, beating Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) 67-54 in a national classic basketball return leg match at United States International University - Africa (USIU-A) basketball courts in Nairobi. The victory brought to an end KPA women’s two-year unbeaten run in the local scene which dates back to 2015 play-offs finals, which the dockers lost 3-2 to USIU. Both KPA and Storms had league matches on Saturday, with KPA winning 67-36 against Strathmore University while Storms lost 59-24 to Equity. On Sunday, Storms started stronger, leading KPA from the tip off with Becky Nkatha, Melisa Akinyi, Mercy Wanyama, Angela Luchivya and Irene Wafula proving difficult to contain for KPA, whose main actors Betty Kananu, Seline Okumu, Bright Wanjala and Donasama Obonyo had a bad day in office. Storms, who at one time led by 23 points, took a 14-09 lead in the first quarter and 22-12 in the second for a 36-21 score line at the break. They continued terrorising KPA in the third which they win 15-14 leaving KPA to take the fourth 19-16 that could not help change the scores in favour the Dockers. Nkatha scored a game-high 18 points which included three from beyond the arc while Melisa Akinyi and Mercy Wanyama scored 14 and 13 points respectively. Celine Okumu and Bright Nanzala contributed 14 and 10 points respectively for KPA. “After the Saturdays loss, the girls came with a lot of determination. We knew they would run as down so we opted to stay in the paint to control boards,” an elated Storms coach Abel Nson said after the match. KPA coach Anthony Ojukwu blamed the lose on bad luck said his charges had a very bad day.
