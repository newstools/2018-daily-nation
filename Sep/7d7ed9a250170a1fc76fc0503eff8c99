Defending champion Duncan Mugabe from Uganda and former winners Ismail Changawa (Kenya) and Edgar Kazembe (Uganda) will renew their rivalry when the Britam Kenya Open Tennis Championship serves off from September 15-22 at the Nairobi Club. Mugabe is currently in the United States taking part in Futures Tournaments, while Changawa is fresh from guiding Team Kenya to victory at the East Africa Community Games in Burundi. Tennis Kenya vice chairman Francis Mutuku indicated that Kazembe will be out to reclaim the title the won several years back as the tournament received a major boost Wednesday from Britam, who unveiled Sh3 sponsorship. Mutuku disclosed that the tournament has attracted over 250 players drawn from 11 countries in East and Central Africa. Kenya will be eying to reclaim both the men and women’s titles in the tournament that’s has drawn players from Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Malawi and South Sudan.   Mugabe and Natali Coronel of Argentina won the men and women's singles titles last year with the Ugandan beating Kenya's Sheil Kotecha 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 in the men's final as Coronel edged out Gabon's Celestine Avomo Ella 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 in the women's affair. Changawa, who won it in a row in 2015, 2016 and 2017, will be hoping to make a great comeback after he failed to retain Kenya Open title last year, with Kotecha eying to unlock his potential and lift his maiden title after reaching the final last year. Changawa’s sister Shufaa has also set the sights on reclaiming the women’s title. Seniors’ fray will be preceded by the Britam Kenya Open Junior Championships due for this weekend at the Nairobi Club. Mutuku said they have incorporated a section for development, which will target youngsters aged below 10, eight and six and beginners. The tournament’s referee is Patrick Kamuhia, while Rose Wanjala is the championships’ director.
