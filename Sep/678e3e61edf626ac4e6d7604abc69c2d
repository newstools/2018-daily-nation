An Aunt of Sharon Otieno, the woman who was abducted and killed in Homa Bay, 'died of shock' after hearing of the 26-year-old's tragic death. Joshua Okongo, the spokesperson of Ms Otieno's family, said Deborah Ogweno, 44, collapsed on Wednesday and "succumbed to shock" on Friday morning. He said her body was taken to a mortuary in Awendo, Migori County. While speaking to journalists at Ms Otieno's home in Magare village, Homa Bay, Mr Okongo urged the political class to stay away from the matter. Mr Okongo at the same time asked the government to carry out proper investigations so that those behind the chilling murder of their daughter can be known and face justice. He said the family has not made any arrangement for the burial of Ms Otieno yet because they are waiting for post-mortem results.  More follows.
