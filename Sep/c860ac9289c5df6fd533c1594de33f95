Kenyan Fifa referee Davies Ogenche Omweno will take charge of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Group “E” qualifier pitting hosts Seychelles and Nigeria on Saturday. Omweno, who hails from Nakuru, will be assisted by countryman Gilbert Cheruiyot, as Ugandan Mark Ssonko serves as second assistant referee. The 3.30pm kick off has been slated for Linite Stadium in Mahe. Nigeria sit third on the group without a point having lost 2-0 to second-placed South Africa in the first round qualifier on June 10. Libya top the group with three points following their massive 5-1 win over Seychelles. The Mediterranean Knights are now coached by former Harambee Stars coach Adel Amrouche, who replaced Egyptian Omar Al-Maryami in May. Amrouche will lead his charges for the first time when they visit South Africa on Saturday. The Algerian turned Belgian is assisted by former Bandari coach Ken Odhiambo who joined him in July.
