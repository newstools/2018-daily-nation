City Hall may be plunged into darkness over an unpaid electricity bills of over Sh1 billion that has prompted the Kenya Power managing director to write to Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. In a letter dated September 24, 2018 and which Mr Sonko shared on a social media group, Kenya Power acting Managing Director Jared Othieno said the outstanding debt stands at Sh1,132,465,248. "Nairobi City County government entered into a credit arrangement in June 2018 with KPLC spelling out how the county electricity bills are to be settled in order to reduce the outstanding arrears which at the time stood at Sh990,000,00," Mr Othieno states in the letter. NO PAYMENT He said several months have lapsed since the power firm last received payment from the county government. "This has led to further accrual of the debt to the current Sh1,132,465,248. Efforts to engage the county on the same have been unsuccessful,” Mr Othieno said. The MD sought an appointment with the governor in order to “pursue an amicable solution”. "We wish to request for an appointment with you to discuss the best way forward on this matter,” Mr Othieno said in the letter. The letter is copied to the Ministry of Energy’s permanent secretary and Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter. Mr Sonko did not respond to our queries on the matter.
