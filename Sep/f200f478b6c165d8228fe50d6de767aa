"Hon OkothObado has just been arrested after recording his statement... & is currently in lawful custody at Gigiri Police Station. He will be arraigned in court on Monday to face charges of murder of university student Sharon Otieno," tweeted the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). The governor was arrested early Friday and questioned for several hours on the murder of Otieno. "We were asked to present ourselves to the DCI but they arrested him.
