Police raided China Global Television Network offices in Nairobi on Wednesday in search of immigrants working in the country illegally. The Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet told Nation that his team made the raid after his office got information that some staff members at the TV station did not have valid work permits. The IG said 13 Chinese nationals were arrested and immediately released after their work documents were verified. The Chinese Embassy issued a statement condemning the arrest of their citizens by Kenya police. The consulate said Chinese nationals who hold legal residence and working permits should not be detained. The Immigration department began a crackdown against foreigners working in the country illegally in May. More than 100,000 foreigners are targeted in the countrywide operation, which was launched by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i.
