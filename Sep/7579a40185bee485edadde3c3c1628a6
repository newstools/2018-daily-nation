Eldoret Youth registered a 1-0 away victory against hosts Shabana FC to maintain their unbeaten record in the Football Kenya Federation third tier league on Saturday. Eldoret’s forward Hosea Koech scored the only goal of the match in the 92nd to ensure his side collect all the three points. Sitting pretty at the helm of the table with 52 points, Eldoret Youth have not lost any match this season having won 16 and drawn thrice, while second-placed Shabana FC have 46 points, having lost two matches, won fourteen and drawn four. Eldoret coach Evans Mafuta attributed his victory to good preparations. “I congratulate my players for being on toes throughout the match although Shabana dominated in the first half” he said. His Shabana counterpart Andrew Kanuli revealed that they wasted many scoring opportunities. “I can’t believe this, it was our day but in football anything can happen any time and one has to accept it” he said. This was the first match Shabana played at Gusii stadium since renovations were completed at the facility one month ago. The side has been using Mosocho and Kenyenya fields during their home matches. Winners from Zone A and B will be promoted to the National Super League, with runners-up facing each other in a play-off match.
