Police have recovered Sh2.4 million from a saloon car in Migori County. The money, in different currencies, was recovered from a car at Kakrao roadblock on the Migori-Kisii highway on Monday. During the incident, one suspect escaped after the police manning the roadblock flagged down their vehicle. Upon interrogation, two other occupants of the vehicle could not explain source of the cash. Migori County Police Commander Joseph Nthenge said his officers stopped the car after getting a tip-off from the public. "The vehicle had three male occupants, but one managed to escape and we are still tracking him down," said Mr Nthenge. He said the police found Sh1.5 million, USD 9,459 (Sh945,900) and Tsh110,000 (Sh4,869) among other items in the saloon car. Mr Nthenge said: "We suspect that the occupants of the vehicle are drug traffickers and were going to use the cash to buy bhang."
