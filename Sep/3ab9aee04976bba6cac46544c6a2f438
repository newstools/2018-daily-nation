National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi deserves praise for rejecting a request by MPs to go to Japan to watch the national women’s volleyball team play in the forthcoming world championship. The decision resonates with many Kenyans, who are disgusted with the wastefulness our leaders have been indulging in. In this day and age of technological advancement, we do not see why the MPs should travel all the way to Tokyo to watch the matches. They can — and should — follow the games on television, or even on their smartphones and other digital gadgets if they have to analyse our team’s performance. It is obvious that the lawmakers’ desire was motivated by selfish pursuits. They were simply trying to get yet another junket. The volleyball tournament will be fully broadcast on television and streamed on several internet sites. WASTE It is, therefore, commendable that Speaker Muturi has said no to this nonsense. Indeed, it is just about the leaders’ penchant for the so-called ‘benchmarking’ that is just a waste of public money. The aborted request comes only months after an outcry over a trip by another group of MPs to the football World Cup on the public tab. The members of a parliamentary committee went to Russia to ostensibly learn how to improve sports. Long after their return, they had not submitted their report on whatever they learnt that could be of value to Kenya. The report turned out to be not worth the paper on which it was written. In other words, public money just went down the drain. Parliament is now on the right track. We hope the Senate and county assemblies, and the national government, will similarly put an end to this wastefulness. Those who seek entertainment should pay for it themselves.
