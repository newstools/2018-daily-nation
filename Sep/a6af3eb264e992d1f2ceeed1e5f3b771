SAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES Europe surged into a dominant lead over the United States in the 42nd edition of the Ryder Cup on Saturday. AFP Sport picks out some of the best quotes from a gripping second day in which the Europeans finished with a 10-6 advantage: "He's one of my best friends, not just on Tour but in life."- Fleetwood continues his week-long bromance with Molinari. They became the first pair to take four wins from as many matches since 1979 "We came here to do a job, and it wasn't to go in the records books or anything like that, it's about the team, it's about getting to 14 1/2."- Molinari isn't getting ahead of himself going into the final day "About the piece of history together, it's very special."- Fleetwood is a happy man too. He and Italian Molinari can become Europe's first-ever player to claim five points in Sunday's singles "Just pretty pissed off, the fact that I lost three matches, and didn't feel like I played poorly."- A despondent Tiger Woods after being beaten by Fleetwood and Molinari in all three of his matches "I was emotional earlier. I've always been a bit that way. I cry in movies, as well. Hey, not embarrassed. I care about it. It means an awful lot to me."- Paul Casey shed a tear after claiming his first Ryder Cup win since 2006 "It's usually movies, usually when I'm sitting there watching with my kids and they turn around and it's usually a cartoon or something, Disney; any good character gets killed or something, gets squashed, kills me."- Casey expands on his more difficult moments watching films "They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess. Early wins tomorrow go a long way."- Jordan Spieth talks up the Americans' chances of a famous fightback   Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia laid the foundations for a dominant start by Europe.
