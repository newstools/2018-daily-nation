Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has moved to court seeking to quash a search warrant obtained by the anti-graft agency a week ago. In a petition certified urgent by the High Court, Dr Kidero argues that the order is vague and open-ended and that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has used it to seize his documents and properties as they "fish for incriminating evidence" against him and his family members. Further, he wants the court to order EACC to return his properties and documents, which were seized from his home in Muthaiga on September 20, a day after obtaining the warrant from a court in Milimani. SERVE DOCUMENTS The court directed his lawyer Tom Ojienda to serve the court documents to EACC, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General among others. The case will be heard on October 4. Dr Kidero says in the petition that since he left office after the 2017 General Election, he has been subject to intimidation, harassment, threats and attacks by EACC and its officers. He has cited his arrest on August 8, where he was picked and charged with alleged corruption, during his tenure as the Nairobi Governor. It is clear that the second respondent has resorted to intimidating the 1st petitioner’s family members in a bid to touch him where it hurts most and make his family members, friends and associates shun him,” he said in a sworn statement. He claimed the raid of his home on September was by about 40 people, wielding guns and who held him hostage from 4am to about midday.
