The International Association of Athletics (IAAF) on Sunday slapped a four-year ban on Zambian athlete, Mupopo Kabange, for failing a doping test. Mupopo, 26, is a former gold medallist at the 2016 African 400 women Championship and has represented Zambia at several major international competitions such as the Commonwealth and the All-Africa Games. IAAF conducted a doping test on Mupopo during the London World Championships. According to a list of sanctions released by IAAF, Mupopo is among the 43 athletes who have been sanctioned for failing a doping test. But the Zambia Amateur Athletic Association (ZAAA) President, Elias Mpondela, said the association was yet to be presented with the findings. Mupopo debuted in the IAAF Diamond League in Doha in May 2015, placing seventh in 51.88. In July 2015, she ran 50.86 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, improving her national record by 100th of a second. She was selected for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing. Mupopo doubles as a football player who plies her trade with Zambia womenâ€™s national team. Last month, Fifa banned Zambia great Kalusha Bwalya from all football-related activities for two years for unethical conduct.
