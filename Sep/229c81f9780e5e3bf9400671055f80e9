Harambee Stars striker Michael Olunga believes time has come for Kenya to return to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Olunga led the Stars see-off a star-studded Ghana 1-0 in a 2019 Afcon Group "F" qualifier at Kasarani stadium on Saturday exerting pressure on Ghana defender Nicholas Opoku to score in his own net while attempting to clear Eric Johanna’s cross. Kenya are now level on three points with Ghana after two rounds ahead of back-to-back games against Ethiopia on October 10 and 13. “I believe time has come for us to make it (back to the Afcon) after years out. Personally I have to work hard and tried to make home fans proud by banging in goals whenever I get the chance,” he said on Sunday after the morning training session at Kenya School of Monetary Studies. The Japan-based forward added: “It’s an honour playing for the national team and we just hope that there will be more motivation so we can keep focus. We’ve two more home games and with home support like the one against Ghana, we can get the three points and qualify.” The former Gor Mahia man also thanked the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) for their support, whilst challenging the government, through the Ministry of Sports, to clear the team's budget on time. “We appreciate what FKF has done so far and also thank the government for issuing tickets on time, maybe pending match bonuses which if cleared on time can be a moral booster. “They should also improve on the infrastructure in the country so that we can promote local football, have more academies, good playing surfaces across the country like the one at Kasarani which we hope will be maintained well,” he concluded.   Mwendwa was non-committal on the matter but said they will continue to improve on the few things lacking.
