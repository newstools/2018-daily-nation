The Energy Regulatory Commission has announced new fuel prices following the revision of the VAT on petroleum products from 16 percent to eight percent. ERC Director-General Pavel Oimeke on Friday said the new prices will take effect from Friday to October 14. The new costs, he said, have also taken into account the anti-adulteration levy of Sh18 per litre on Kerosene in line with the Finance Act 2018 that was assented to by President Kenyatta on Friday. “As a result, the pump prices per litre in Nairobi of Super Petrol and diesel decrease by Sh8.80 and Sh7.35 respectively, while that of Kerosene increases by Sh10.71,” Mr Oimeke said in a statement Friday. Super petrol will retail at Sh116.79 in Nairobi, diesel at Sh108.12 and Kerosene at Sh108.41 per litre. In Mombasa, a litre of super petrol will now be sold at Sh114.15, diesel at Sh105.50 and Kerosene at Sh105.78. The new prices show poor households that use paraffin to cook and light their homes will bear the brunt of the law changes passed by the National Assembly in a chaotic debate on Thursday.   Duale said there is need to raise money for development and government projects.
