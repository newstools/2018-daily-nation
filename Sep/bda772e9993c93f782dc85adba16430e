The Aga Khan University Hospital has confirmed partnering with Nairobi County to advise and help Pumwani Maternity Hospital improve care for women and newborns. The confirmation came on Monday as the county prepared to conduct post-mortems on the 12 babies who were found dead at the hospital last week. SPECIALTY TRAINING According to the private hospital, the partnership will include specialty training in nursing, obstetrics/gynaecology and paediatrics. Specialist trainees and university faculty will collaborate with Pumwani's medical and nursing staff. “Aga Khan University’s Centre of Excellence for Women and Child Health, along with the medical college, have entered discussions to advise and assist Pumwani Maternity Hospital to improve care for women and newborns,” said a statement from the hospital. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko announced the public-private partnership on Friday, terming it a temporary solution" for the Pumwani crisis. “The university has advised and assisted several public hospitals, including Pumwani Maternity Hospital, by providing assistance in areas such as education, training and research. This is an important part of AKU’s permanent mission to Kenya and East Africa," he noted. "It was resolved that Aga Khan will provide additional doctors, nurses and hospital support staff for a period of two years at no cost." He further said the county found a “permanent solution” to the crisis - the construction of the 450-bed 'Sonko Pumwani Maternity Hospital and College of Nursing and Midwifery'. The hospital, that will cover a total area of 39,699m2, will have facilities including a labour ward, delivery suites with four fully functional theatres, a post-natal ward, a newborn unit with 100 incubators, a neo-natal Intensive Care Unit and High Dependency Unit as well as 30 breastfeeding rooms.   The board says five died under unclear circumstances, three were born dead and that four died in the first 24 hours of life.
