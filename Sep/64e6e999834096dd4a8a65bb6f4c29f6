Rongo University students took to the streets Wednesday to protest over the killing of their colleague Sharon Otieno. Ms Otieno, a second-year student, was murdered and her body dumped in a thicket in Oyugis, Homa Bay County. She was abducted alongside Nation Journalist Barrack Oduor on Monday night. Mr Oduor managed to escape from the abductors. The students protesting called for speedy investigations into the murder of Ms Otieno. Merceline Nanjala, a student at the university said, "the arrest of Governor Okoth Obadoâ€™s aide is a good step. The police must get to the bottom of this matter." Until her death, Ms Otieno was a second-year Medical Records and Information student. She was pregnant and had deferred her studies.
