A Kisii court has ordered the lock-up of two more suspects arrested in connection with the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. Mr Elvis Omondi, a policeman attached to Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s security detail, and Mr Caspal Obiero, a clerk in Migori County government, will spend 10 days in police cells. Kisii Senior Resident Magistrate Lutta Shiundu said their detention would as police time to complete their investigations. Mr Shiundu said he was satisfied with prosecution’s request that the nature of investigations into Ms Otieno’s murder was complex and, therefore, detectives needed more time. “But the respondents will be allowed access to medical attention and to their advocates,” said Mr Shiundu while further directing that the two be detained at Keroka Police Station. Mr Obiero and Mr Omondi, through their lawyer Omunde Kisera, had asked the court to release them on bond, saying their continued detention was in breach of the law. The case will be mentioned on September 28, 2018.  More follows.   A vehicle he drives linked to kidnapping of the varsity student and Nation staff.
