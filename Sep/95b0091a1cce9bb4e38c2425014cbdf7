The widow of slain Kiru High School principal Solomon Mwangi wants to be freed so that she can look for school fees for her children. Appearing before the High court in Nakuru, Ms Jane Muthoni Mucheru, appealed for a review of her bond terms saying that her children, who have been adversely affected by the case, have been sent out of school for failing to pay fees. DROPPED OUT Ms Mucheru, a former Icaciri Girls Secondary School head teacher, is charged alongside Mr Isaac Ng’ang’a with killing Mr Mwangi in November 2016. According to the woman, her first born daughter, who was a second year university student, dropped out while her second born has had to suspend her high school education. “I need to get out so that I can look for school fees for my two children who have been forced to drop out of their schools. I am the only one who can take care of the children,” said Ms Mucheru. She further said her health had been deteriorating after prison authorities refused to take her to hospital. Mr Mwangi’s strangled body was found dumped in a thicket in Kiambu County after he was reported missing. BAIL Through her lawyer Francis Njanja, the accused told the court that she would not interfere with witnesses if freed on bail. The case which was being heard at the High court in Kiambu was transferred to Nakuru following the transfer of the presiding judge, Justice Joel Ngugi, to the county. Justice Ngugi slated the hearing of the application for a bond review on October 19 and October 20 as the prosecution prepares to continue with their list of 20 witnesses. The court further directed that Ms Mucheru and Mr Ng’ang’a be remanded at Lang’ata Womens Prison and  Nairobi Remand Home respectively.   Justice Joel Ngugi was moved from Kiambu to Nakuru in March.
