Kenya will not be taking part at the Women’s World Under-20 Volleyball Championship due in Mexico next year after they finished fifth in the Africa qualifying tournament that ended on Sunday at Kasarani, Nairobi. Cameroon bundled out Kenya in the preliminaries 3-1 as the hosts finished second in the group topped by the Central Africans with Nigeria second. However, Rwanda and Egypt won their semi-finals to not only advance to the final but also claim World Cup berths. The result is not surprising; it’s a clear manifestation of dwindling local women’s volleyball standards. Similarly, there is nothing to write home about the men’s game, whether at club or national level. It’s not the first time Kenyan women’s volleyball teams are losing to Cameroon and Rwanda, which are fast becoming superpowers away from the North African teams. CLUB CHAMPIONSHIPS It’s Cameroon who dented the national team Malkia Striker’s 2016 Rio Olympic Games chances. They also beat Kenya 3-0 to win the Africa Volleyball Championships last year. In the club championships, Kenyan sides are yet to win since Kenya Prisons in 2013. The performance of the women’s U-20 team should now awake the sleeping Kenya Volley Federation and the government to action. KVF need to come up with defined structures that will not only help to identify talent but also mould it across all the levels. TALENT SEARCH Talent search seems to have been left to schoolteachers and coaches who have passion for the sport with no support from the federation. For instance, veteran coaches David Lung’aho and Japheth Munala have taken up the initiative to scout for talent. Poor facilities are another obstacle to good performance. The country cannot expect to perform well when the teams are reduced to training in open grounds when the sport is now an indoor affair.
