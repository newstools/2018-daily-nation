Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) teams were made to fight for every point before registering wins over United States International University (USIU) teams in National Classic basketball league matches at the KPA hall in Makande, Mombasa County on Saturday. While the womenâ€™s team rallied from behind to beat USIU Flames 56-28, the men had to wait for the last quarter to win 68-58 in balanced and entertaining matches which kept fans at the edge of their seats. League action continues Sunday when KPA women play KU Oryx and KPA men tackle Ulinzi at 2.00pm and 4.00pm respectively. In Nairobi, Strathmore University Swords kept alive their chances of qualifying for this year's women's Kenya Basketball Premier League play-offs when they demolished winless Western Delight 56-14. The students raced to an 18-4 advantage in the first quarter and led 35-10 at the half. The return leg match played at USIU-A, saw Strathmore Swords relax their aggressive offense in the last two quarters but they still ran over Western Delight 11-2 and 10-2 in the third and fourth. In another top women's Premier League tie at the same venue, Footprints revived their play-off hopes by registering a narrow 55-54 victory over unlucky Eagle Wings. Eagle Wings, who had veteran Rebecca Sarange scoring 13 points, should blame themselves for throwing away the victory after enjoying a huge 37-22 half-time lead. Footprints led by Faith Ayodi, who scored a game-high 22 points, re-grouped in the two final quarters to punish Eagle Wings 16-14 and 17-13, for a much deserved victory. Strathmore University teams were on a roll as their women's Division One side also beat Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) 61-36. Little Prince kept up their winning ways to overcome newcomers Woodley Knights 75-64. Riara University suffered their second consecutive defeat in their women's Division Two league as they were rocked 69-45 by JKUAT.
