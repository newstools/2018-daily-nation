Nairobi-based Little Prince on Saturday suffered a big blow when Nebulas Kakamega thrashed them 68-40 in a Kenya Basketball Federation men’s National Division Two League match at Kakamega police canteen grounds. Little Prince Team Manager William Maundu was quick to attribute their defeat to lack of a full squad. “As per KBF rules, we are supposed to be 12 players but only six players travelled due to lack of funds. This affected our game plan," Maundu said. Saturday's loss hampered Little Prince's, who are on third on 29 points, from toppling Riara University (29) and Blazers (30) from second and first place respectively in the 12-team League. Nebulas' victory powered them to the top five with 27 points from 15 matches played. Nebulas started the match on a high note as they led the first quarter 13-6. The visitors fought back gallantly to hold the hosts 11-11 in the second quarter, with Nebulas managing to secure a 24-17 lead at the breather. In both quarters, Nebulas' shooting guard Hillary Songoro led his side in scoring 10 points, while the visitors' point guard Victor Otieno returned nine points in both quarters. After half time, Nebulas capitalised on their depleted opponents to outscore them 30-11. Efforts by Little Prince to win the fourth quarter went up in smoke as Nebulas squeezed a 14-12 win. Nebulas centre Fred Sande scored a high of 18 points, while forward Victor Okoth scored 11 points for the city lads. Nebulas assistant coach Caleb Musilwa praised his boys for winning the match. "The boys played well. The attack was well executed which led to our victory," he added.
