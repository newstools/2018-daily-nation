The Postal Corporation of Kenya has ventured into clearing and forwarding to enable it to finance its operations in the wake of disruption by new technologies. Postmaster-general Dan Kagwe said on Friday the diversification would also help Posta to sustain its workforce. “Clearing and forwarding is not a cost to implement, it is just manpower that we need and we have the manpower. We have 3,000 employees and instead of thinking of redundancy or retrenchments we want to create work for our staff,” he said at the flagging off of a fleet of new motor vehicles for mail and courier services in Nairobi. Mr Kagwe said they are clearing for National Oil Corporation of Kenya, Central Bank of Kenya and individuals — mostly car importers. The new fleet includes 11 Isuzu DMAX TRF 86 worth Sh39 million. In June, the corporation flagged off 11 VW Polos for the sales services worth Sh17 million. Posta said the acquisition of the 22 vehicles worth Sh56 million was internally funded. The Treasury does not grant Posta subsidy since its split from the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation in 1999   Struggling Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK) has been ordered to pay more than 4,000 former employees money likely to run into billions.
