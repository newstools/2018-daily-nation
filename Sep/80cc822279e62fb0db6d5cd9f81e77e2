Traffic woes rocked the Likoni Channel in Mombasa on Wednesday morning after Mv Jambo, Kenya’s biggest ferry, broke down. Motorists and pedestrians seeking to cross the Indian Ocean to South Coast were forced to queue for long hours to get transport. The congestion affected commuters rushing to work, who forced their way into the three available ferries— Mv Nyayo, Mv Harambee and Mv Kwale. The breakdown has resulted in traffic snarl-up on both sides of the channel as the management struggles to help pedestrians cross the ocean. Mv Jambo is the biggest ferry in Kenyan and the Kenya Ferry Services relies on deal with congestion at the channel. The vessel broke down on the Mombasa Island side of the channel after it developed a mechanical problem, according to a KFS official who spoke on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to issue press statements. The Nation team saw the faulty ferry at the ramp of the channel. On Wednesday morning, the vessel blocked two other ferries from docking at the Mombasa-Island side, complicating the situation. The government paid a Turkish firm Sh2 billion for the construction of MV Jambo which was delivered in August last year.   More follows.
