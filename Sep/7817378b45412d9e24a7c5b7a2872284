A multi-agency team of detectives have seized 92 kilogrammes of heroin worth at least Sh300 million in Kikambala, Kilifi County. The team from Nairobi comprising officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and anti-narcotics unit raided the residential house where the drugs were hidden on Thursday.   The officers gained access into the two-bedroom house through a window and found the drugs that were stashed in two black suitcases. Police are searching for the female tenant who is said to have escaped after she got wind of the planned raid.   The narcotics originated from Mbarara, Uganda.
