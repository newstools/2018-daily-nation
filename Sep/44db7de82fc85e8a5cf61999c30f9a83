Minority Leader in the National Assembly John Mbadi has termed the bid to remove him from the position as political witch-hunt being propagated by people within and without the ODM party. Mr Mbadi claimed there are some senior politicians in ODM, whom he did not name, that are working with some external forces to create unnecessary division within the party. He added that the same individuals are against the handshake between President Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga and are now using him as a soft target to scuttle the new found union in the National Assembly. NOT SCARED “I’m not new to this kind of battle, even when I was appointed ODM chairman, there are people who were not happy. Let them know that I will not be scared by their sideshows and I will continue to discharge my mandate both as chairman and minority leader,” said Mr Mbadi Wednesday. Kilifi North MP Owen Baya on Monday wrote to Mr Odinga calling for the removal of Mr Mbadi over his conduct during the chaotic special sitting last Thursday on President Kenyatta’s memorandum on VAT. Deputy Minority Leader in the National Assembly, Mr Robert Mbui, termed the idea of removing Mr Mbadi as misplaced and that it would not amount to anything since he was just communicating the party's position on the President Kenyatta’s memorandum.
