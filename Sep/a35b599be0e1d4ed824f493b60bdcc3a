The 20-year-old eight-months pregnant woman Ms Saida Abderehman, who was abducted in Mombasa on Thursday, has been found in Nairobi. Ms Abderehman was found on Sunday evening outside Pumwani mosque. Her relatives said she was found by a Good Samaritan who then linked her with a kin in Nairobi. However, the family spokesperson Aqrima Mohammed told the Nation that Ms Abderehman is no longer pregnant. "She has now been taken to the hospital. We are yet to know whether she got a miscarriage because of what she went through or it was aborted," said Mr Mohammed. Mombasa Director of Criminal Investigations boss Jacob Kanake said Ms Abderehman has been asked to report to a nearby police station after she recovers. "We would want to know what happened. Whether she was really abducted or was part of the whole saga because the foetus is not with her and we are probing that," said Mr Kanake. Ms Abderehman has been admitted to Radiant Hospital on Juja Road, Nairobi. One of her relatives in Nairobi, Mr Faraj Ahmed, said Ms Abderehman told him she was was abducted by six women."She said three of them had an accent from Lamu. She told me that she escaped from her abductors at around 4am and ran to unknown place. We will interrogate her further when she gets well," said Mr Ahmed.   Family says kidnappers have not demanded any ransom for pregnant woman.
