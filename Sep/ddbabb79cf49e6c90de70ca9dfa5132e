The anti-corruption watchdog has arrested five members of Nyeri Public Service Board over irregular hiring of ward administrators. The suspects who were taken to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) regional headquarters in Nyeri town are accused of abusing their office. They include board chairperson Alice Waruguru Muita,  CEO Anthony Ndonga Muriu and members Beatrice Wanjiru Gikaru, Geoffrey Wachira Mahinda and Shelomith Wanjiru Nderitu. According to a statement released by EACC, there were irregularities in the recruitment of sub–county administrators and ward administrators between July 2013 and March 2014. The breaches were committed during the leadership of the late governor Nderitu Gachagua. “There was proof of the abdication of responsibilities, neglect of duty and a severe lack of due diligence on the part of the Nyeri CPSB,” the statement reads in part. “Investigations found the CPB secretary and four board members responsible and thus culpable for those irregularities. The investigations also disclosed deception on the part of some of the applicants who were ultimately appointed as ward administrators.” The inquiry file was submitted to Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji who directed EACC to arrest the suspects, who are set to face abuse of office charges. Other charges are conspiracy to commit of corruption, forgery and uttering false documents.
