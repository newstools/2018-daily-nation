The trial of 38 suspected members of the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC) charged with being in possession of dangerous weapons failed to kick off. This was after Mr Yusuf Abubakar; the advocate representing the suspects failed to turn up for the hearing as he was engaged in another matter before Malindi Court. SUFFER PREJUDICE The suspects requested the court to adjourn the matter saying they would suffer prejudice should the case proceed in the absence of their lawyer. Senior prosecutor Jami Yamina however indicated that the State was ready to proceed with the case as it had bonded its witnesses. “We are ready to proceed with the matter, we have two witnesses who are ready to testify,” Mr Yamina said. Mr Yamina reluctantly opposed the adjournment but sought for court’s direction in the matter. Senior Principal Magistrate Francis Kyambia adjourned the case and scheduled the hearing for November 13 and 15, this year. WARRANT OF ARREST Meanwhile, a warrant of arrest against Mr Omar Mwamnuadzi who was charged alongside the 38 suspects remains in force. The warrant of arrest was issued in October 2016 after he failed to appear before court to face trial. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko who bailed out Mr Mwamnuadzi has failed to produce him in court so that he can face trial. Mr Mwamnuadzi last made a public appearance when he appeared in a Kwale court in February 2016 for the hearing of a criminal case against him. The suspect who is on the run was nabbed in January 2016 at his Ng’ombeni home in Kwale and charged with being found with Sh210,000 among other criminal offences. State had told the court that the cash is believed to be part of proceeds from recruitment of members into the group.   A Mombasa Republican Council leader was among masterminds of the Tana River attacks in which more than 100 people were killed
