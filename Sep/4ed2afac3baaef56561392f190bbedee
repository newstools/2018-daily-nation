The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is set to commence preparations for Ugenya and Embakasi South constituencies by-elections. This, according to IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati, comes after the Speaker of the National Assembly issued a formal order for the by-elections. “We have received writs of election from the Speaker of the National Assembly for Ugenya Constituency and Embakasi South Constituency. And we will commence preparations for the by-elections immediately,” said Mr Chebukati in a tweet. The Ugenya Constituency seat fell vacant after the Court of Appeal nullified Mr Christopher Karan’s poll victory over irregularities during the elections. DIRTY CAMPAIGN Judge Tripisa Cherere, in her ruling, censured the Orange Democratic Movement for mounting a dirty campaign against former MP David Ochieng, who vied on a Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) party ticket, stating that the former had profited from a "perverted" electioneering period. She also directed Mr Karan to pay Sh3.5 million in costs. CITED MALPRACTICES The Embakasi South parliamentary seat fell vacant after the Court of Appeal, in July, quashed Mr Julius Mawathe’s August 2017 election win following an appeal by his rival Irshad Sumra of ODM. In his application, Mr Sumra cited malpractices, irregularities, illegalities and noncompliance of the law, which he argued had an effect on the results announced at the end of the elections. Mr Sumra went to the Court of Appeal after the High Court, on March 2, upheld Mr Mawathe's poll victory.   Big win for Irshad Sumra of ODM.
