Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji will form a team to investigate killing of suspects by police officers at the Coast. Mr Haji on Sunday said the team will be established in the next two weeks, and warned police officers against impunity. "As we fight corruption vigorously, we will also fight such impunity. If there are officers who are involved, they should know that this is not sanctioned and we will investigate and prosecute them," he said at Mombasa-based Haki Africa offices. He added that since the public must adhere to the rule of law, the incidents will be conclusively investigated. "I am concerned that this is happening at the coast and other parts of the country. The government does not condone such killings and if anything we should term them as extragovernmental killings and not extrajudicial killings," he said after receiving a report by Haki Africa on purported extrajudicial killings. RULE OF LAW Haki Africa Executive Director Hussein Khalid handed Mr Haji a list of 34 people who are believed to have been killed by police in Mombasa. Mr Khalid said such police actions should be put to an end. "We do not condone crime. We want actions to be carried out legally. The killings have been worsening and what we want is to find an amicable solution," Mr Khalid said. Police have however defended themselves, saying those killed were criminals who have been causing residents, especially in Kisauni, Mombasa, sleepless nights. BIAS Mombasa Police Commander Johnston Ipara has asked human rights organisations not to be biased. But Mr Khalid said they champion for the rights of all Kenyans. "The other day a police officer was killed and we were at the forefront calling for investigations to ensure that those involved are arrested. We will continue doing what is right; killing is not right, thus we will oppose it to the end."
