A man was on Monday charged in a Meru court with the murder of a woman. Mr Amos Kimathi was accused of murdering Ms Laurine Kawira Munyi at Kaaga in Meru town. He denied the charge before High Court Judge Alfred Mabeya. Defence lawyer Amos Wamache made an application to have his client released on bond and that he supplied with the statements the prosecution intends to rely on during trial. “I request the court to release the accused on reasonable bond terms. He is not a flight risk. I also request that we be supplied with statements and any document that the prosecution will use during trial,” said Mr Wamache. DENIED BOND The court declined to free Mr Kimathi on bond after the prosecutor, Patrick Namita, opposed the application. “I request this court to suspend the application of bond terms for 14 days because the investigators believe there are compelling reasons to deny him bond,” Mr Namita told the court. The prosecutor also told the court that the accused’s safety, if set free, is not guaranteed because the residents are not happy with him. Justice Mabeya ordered that a probation report be presented to court within 30 days when a ruling will be made on whether to release him on bond or not. The case will be mentioned on October 24, 2018. HELD HOSTAGE Ms Kawira who worked as the deputy county statistical officer in Meru County was killed a month ago in Makutano when an assailant allegedly held her and her female friend hostage for more than six hours. On that fateful night, a man entered into her house at around 6pm, in what neighbours described as usual but turned against her. The man is said to have forced them to give out their M-Pesa and bank account details and, using other accomplices, withdrew money from the accounts. After that the man killed Ms Kawira and stabbed the other woman leaving her in critical condition.
