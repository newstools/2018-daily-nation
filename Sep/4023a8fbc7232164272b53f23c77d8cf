Two people have been killed and several houses torched following ethnic clashes in Orondere village in Marsabit on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Confirming the incident, Saku deputy county commissioner Joseph Orambui Nyakwara said two other people are nursing bullet injuries. CHACHU GANYA He said one of those killed was a police reservist from the Gabbra conservation scheme. “We have contained the situation and there are no attacks at the moment. Police have been deployed in the area,” Mr Nyakwara said. However, North Horr MP Chachu Ganya said the clashes should not have happened since the county security team had prior intelligence of the impending attack. “Two days ago, some people from a different community came and settled at Orondere. The residents called their leaders and I specifically talked to people from the county commissioner’s office,” Mr Ganya said. MARSABIT He said the security team, led by Marsabit Central assistant county commissioner, were on the ground on Wednesday, but the clashes started later that night. “We hope the security team will be able to contain the clashes, which is still ongoing. We are calling on our people to stop fighting over grazing fields; we can all co-exist peacefully,” Mr Ganya said.    Politics of exclusion and clan rivalry are some of the key issues fuelling violence in northern Kenya.
