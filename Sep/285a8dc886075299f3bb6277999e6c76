Berlin Marathon and newly crowned world record holder in marathon Eliud Kipchoge is expected to be feted in Kapsabet, Nandi County on Monday. Kipchoge smashed the previous world record by compatriot Dennis Kimetto of 2:02:57 by a massive one minutes and 16 seconds, clocking 2 hours, 01 minute and 39 seconds to retain his Berlin Marathon on September 16. The athlete, who hails from the region, will be hosted by the governor Stephen Sang for breakfast for his brilliant performance two weeks ago when he broke the world record in the streets of the German city. Amos Kipruto, who was second behind Kipchoge and the women category winner Gladys Cherono, will also be rewarded. After the breakfast, the governor with the athletes, will commission the newly named Eliud Kipchoge Sports Complex opposite the Kipchoge Stadium in Kapsabet, which is still under construction. Governor Stephen Sang said he was committed to developing sporting facilities in order to nurture talents. “Already the national government has taken over the construction of Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Kapsabet. We are now building a sports complex that will include a residential training camp, art studio, gym, swimming pool and other facilities in honour of our athletes,” Sang said. The 200-bed capacity, Sang said, will accommodate Team Kenya for their trainings in preparation for major international assignments including World Championships and Olympic Games. “This complex will also accommodate Team Kenya during their training and a source of Champions, we want to take the lead role in supporting athletics and nothing is going to stop us because they bring glory in our country,” said the governor. He added he would construct training paths for athletes in Kabirirsang village.
