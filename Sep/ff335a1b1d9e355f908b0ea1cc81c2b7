Media and marketing services firm WPP Scangroup PLC #ticker:SCAN has expanded into Nigeria by launching operations through its wholly-owned advertising and public relations subsidiary, Ogilvy. WPP-Scangroup chief executive Bharat Thakrar said opening of Ogilvy Nigeria exudes the group’s commitment to tap into the West African market as well as enhance services offered to its existing clients in the populous country. Ogilvy’s interests in Nigeria were through a partnership with Prima Garnet Communications Limited which ended in court mediated settlement last December 2017. The company's Managing Partner in charge of Customer Engagement in Nairobi, Ms Fiona Uwagwu, has been appointed the Managing Director of firms operations in Nigeria. “Nigeria is one of the biggest economies in sub-Saharan Africa and creates both challenges and opportunities for an innovative communications firm such as Ogilvy. We will make use of our global network advantages, coupled with our local professional services experience, to provide strategic communications support to our clients here,” she said. Ogilvy’s Africa Chief Executive Mathieu Plassard said entry into Nigeria would enable them establish a localised creative communications solutions team to further strengthen the agency’s ability to offer clients focused attention.
