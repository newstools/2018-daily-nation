Police in Mombasa County have arrested 163 Pakistanis living in the country illegally in week-long operation. Coast Regional Police Commander Noah Mwivanda said the Pakistanis were found with fake or expired work permits. "Those arrested were found engaging in car sales business or working in the export processing zones (EPZ," Mr Mwivanda. The police boss said the operation to seize foreigners living in Kenya illegally will continue for the next two months. Mr Mwivanda said the culprits are awaiting deportation. A source privy to the crackdown revealed that many multinational firms in Mombasa opt to bring in expatriates illegally to fill skills gap in some sectors. However, Tourism Professionals Association secretary Sam Ikwaye said the expatriates should be contracted legally. Last week, the government deported six Sri Lankans who were arrested in Voi town in Taita Taveta County for allegedly engaging in illegal gemstone trade. The deported Sri Lankans did not have work permits.   More foreigners to be kicked out in coming months.
