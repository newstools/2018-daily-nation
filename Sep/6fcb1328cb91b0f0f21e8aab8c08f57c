Two suspected robbers were Wednesday morning shot dead by police at Karuguru behind Kamakis along the Eastern bypass. According to Ruiru police commander James Ng'etich, the two were fleeing after committing several robberies in Juja Farm with eight others who are still at large. "They stole a Probox from one homestead which they used it to cart away the stolen goods but upon reaching Githurai, the vehicle's tracking system stalled the car forcing them to flee towards Kamakis aboard some boda bodas. The police trailed them and a shootout ensued but our officers overcame the robbers," said Mr Ng'etich. The car was later taken to Kasarani police station where victims of the robberies were identifying their belongings. Those who spoke to Nation said the robbers were armed with various weapons including machetes and clubs. "They knocked at my door and asked me to let them in and when I refused, they started pouring petrol around the house and lit it up. At that point I had no option other than to beg them to put out the fire as I let them in. They stole electronics and other items," said one of the victims. The incident came barely two days after two other suspected car robbers were shot dead by police in Kimbo. According to the police, the robbers stole a car in Ruai on Sunday only for it to stall at Kimbo after its tracking system made it stop. "The robbers left it unattended until after dark when they made an attempt to pull it using another vehicle, but the officers who had waylaid them quickly moved in leading to an altercation that killed the robbers," an officer privy to details of the incident told the Nation. Cases of car theft are on the rise in Thika, Juja and Ruiru towns with robbers targeting Toyota Probox and Fielder cars.   Just as five men were about to drive out of a petrol station in Nairobiâ€™s Ngara area Thursday, police arrived and sprayed the vehicle with bullets.
