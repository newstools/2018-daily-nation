Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Nick Mwendwa will battle it out on Sunday with four other candidates for a position in the Confederation of African Football to represent the continent's English-speaking countries in the Fifa Council. Caf will pick that representative at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt during the conclusion of their General Assembly that started on Thursday. Former Tanzania Football Federation boss Leodegar Tenga, South Africa Football Assocation president Danny Jordan, Elvis Chetty of Seychelles and Malawi’s Walter Nyamilandu are the other candidates seeking the position that fell vacant when Ghanaian FA boss Kwesi Nyantakyi resigned after being implicated in a bribery scam. “I am qualified and experienced to perform this role as an advisor to the Fifa president,” Mwendwa, 39, earlier told Nation Sport. Caf president Ahmad Ahmad is said to be secretly backing former Malawi player and current FA chief Nyamilandu. There being no candidate from the north and west of Africa, and with Mwendwa and Tenga from the East African region (Cecafa) while the other three are from Southern Africa bloc (Cosafa), it will be interesting to see which bloc produces the winner. Meanwhile, Kenya starts off the 2019 Africa Under-23 Cup of Nations qualifiers against Mauritius. The first round match is scheduled for between November 12 and 20. Eight teams will qualify for the quadrennial competition to be hosted by Egypt in December next year. The top three nations will gain passage to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
