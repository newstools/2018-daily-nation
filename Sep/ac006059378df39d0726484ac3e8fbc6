Harambee Stars coach Sebastian Migne has praised wingback Erick “Marcelo” Ouma for his starring performance in a 1-0 win over Malawi in a friendly match on Tuesday at Kasarani stadium. The Swedish division two side Vasalund defender came off the bench at restart to contribute the winning goal with his inch-perfect cross falling at the feet of Francis Kahata, who turned home from close range 14 minutes to time. “He had an interesting performance. I know him, we didn’t have to wait for today (Tuesday) to see what he can do for the team, he was with us in India and was one of the best players in the tournament,” Migne said of the 21-year-old, who made a name at Gor Mahia during the 2016 top flight campaign. Added Migne: “It was an option not to start him against Ghana (on Saturday), instead I chose Kahata (Francis) to keep the ball on the field, I think it was necessary and it was difficult for me to change the team after the performance against Ghana, but I know his qualities and maybe against Ethiopia it will be another opponent we will see in a month’s time.” His sentiments were echoed by Malawi national team coach Ronny Van Geneugden. “He is a very talented young player with a lot of technical skills. I was also impressed with variations in his game moving inside and outside,” said the Belgian. “I think he has a nice future but it will be good for him to move to a club where they play with three forwards; two wingers and a central striker because he is good on the offensive and dangerous outside 18 yard area and can give good crosses.” Geneugden further tipped Harambee Stars to qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nation (Afcon) finals. “I think you can make a good strong team where they are a lot of variations physically and technically in your squad, also the jersey 16 (Francis Kahata) is another clever player ready to find space and be available for transition," concluded the 50-year-old.
