Six houses were set on fire on Sunday near the busy Kipkaren market on the border of Kakamega-Uasin Gishu counties as residents reacted to death of a villager in an illicit brew den. Residents said they torched the houses to flush out suspected criminals who were living in the dingy mud-walled structures used for selling illicit brew. The body of the man was found lying near a footpath next to one of the houses in the place that has been nicknamed Kasarani. Police collected the body and transported it to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) mortuary in Eldoret. Villagers said the man had gone to the place for a drink early in the morning but was attacked and stabbed twice. His assailants are reported to have robbed him of an undisclosed amount of cash. There had been earlier fears that the killing of the villager could ignite tension at the border but traders from both counties went about their activities as usual. “We got fed up with the activities of the suspects who have been hiding in the place and decided to burn down the structures,” said one of the villagers. The scene is a short distance from the Kipkaren police post. Police officers in plain clothes visited the scene and said the incident was being investigated. The Ngenyilel location chief Sammy Tororey said two suspects who were living in one of the houses were being sought to record statements. “There is no tension since the villagers had got tired with the activities of those living in the homes and decided to flush them out,” said Mr Tororey.
