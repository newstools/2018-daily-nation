The Touch Rugby Central League organiser Mwenga Ndoo said that the league has 10 legs where Nairobi will host seven of them with Kajiado, Naivasha and Machakos also being roped in. The league that started two weeks ago and will end in March next year is geared towards bringing people from all walks of life to play the game. “Many people want to play rugby but can’t engage in the physical and tackling mainstream game,” said Ndoo. “That is why we came up with this idea.” Ndoo said they have started with 18 teams and hope to grow in numbers as the league progresses adding that countries like South Africa, England, Australia and New Zealand have full-fledged touch rugby leagues.
