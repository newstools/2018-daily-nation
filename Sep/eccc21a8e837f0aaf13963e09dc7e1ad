Emotions ran high on Saturday at the burial of a pupil who was killed last week while returning to their home in Matungulu, Machakos County. The body of Nimrod Malinda, 11, was found in a banana plantation in Katangini Village. QUICK PROBE Pastor Paul Nzuve of Jesus Works Centre in Ngonda led the ceremony. Mr Nzuve termed the murder shocking as "it robbed the village of a boy who would have grown up to serve the community and help his parents". Those who spoke at the funeral called on police to quicken investigations and arrest and punish the killer. Victor Malinda, the boy's father, also asked police to speed up the probe. "We are in shock and cannot comprehend why [this happened]. we want justice so police should move fast and arrest the killer," he said. Nimrod, a Standard Six pupil at St Francis of Assisi Academy, was killed some 300 metres from his parents' house. Matungulu police boss Samuel Mukuusi said they were searching for the suspect who was at large.
