The government has declared a dusk to dawn restriction of movement by people in clash-hit Olposimoru, Narok County. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator Mr Mongo Chimwaga who led a high-level security team to Lengape village announced the curfew as the government seeks to restore peace in the area. Mr Chimwaga said the government will deploy more security officers in area to restore order. â€œI want to urge you all to remain indoors between 6pm to 6am. Nobody should be found outside within those hours," said Mr Chimwaga. He said those who will defy the order will be arrested. The administrator who was accompanied by Narok County Commissioner George Natembeya, also issued a stern warning against those fanning the clashes. Mr Natembeya confirmed that one person had been arrested in connection to the clashes. The decision to impose a curfew came after day-long peace meetings between local leaders and members of the two communities in Lengape.   Some, however, are afraid that more violence will break out.
