Veronica Wroe's immaculate 1934 Rolls Royce Boatail on Sunday won the 2018 CBA Africa Concours d'Elegance at Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi. The 34-year-old becomes the first woman in history to clinch the Concours d'Elegance. The glamorous, bright yellow Rolls won the hearts of the enthusiastic crowd, many showing their appreciation by taking selfies with the pre-World War Two built machine. Rolls Royce Boatail beat her closest rival, a 1977 Nissan 160J of Sati Gata-Aura by a single point. “Last year I emerged third overall, promising myself to improve my Rolls. With new paintwork, varnish, a chrome upgrade and an exquisite interior, I was sure to impress the judges,” said Veronica. The bikers category produced a new champion, the 1966 Triumph TR 6C owned by Peter Giraudu that garnered 175 points, beating the 1925 Triumph 550 SD of Dominiqie Antoine to second position. Thousands of spectators cheered the vintage, classic cars and motorcycles as they rolled by while the judges inquisitively checked the engines, interior decor, chromes, colour and varnish before awarding points.
