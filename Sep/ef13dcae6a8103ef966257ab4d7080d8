Tension was still high in clash-hit Olposimoru, Narok County on Tuesday as police repulsed youths torching houses in Lengape and Tegat villages. Police said more than 10 houses were set alight. One out of the seven victims of the Olposimoru clashes who were admitted at Tenwek Mission Hospital in Bomet County has been discharged. The victim was discharged today morning as six others who were admitted with arrows lodged in their bodies are still undergoing treatment at the hospital. Mr Geoffrey Langat, the hospitalâ€™s chief executive officer said the patient had sustained minor injuries. "Six patients brought in on Sunday night with various degree of injuries are recuperating in the general wards after successful operation to remove the arrows which were lodged in their bodies," said Mr Langat. The patients were admitted at the hospital following skirmishes that erupted between members of Kipsigis and Maasai communities at Olposimoru on the border of Nakuru and Narok counties. Meanwhile, more security officers from the General Service Unit (GSU) have been deployed to quell chaos in the area. A security source told the Nation that the officers were deployed from a GSU camp at Soit in Transmara, Narok county.   More than 30 homes were set ablaze at Olmariko and Esoit areas in Narok North.
