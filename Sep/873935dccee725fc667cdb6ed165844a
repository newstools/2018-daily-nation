Harambee Stars striker Masud Juma on Saturday completed his move to United Arab Emirates side Dibba Al-Fujairah Club on a short term deal. Juma, 22, parted ways with South African side Cape Town City after a proposed loan deal to Egyptian side El Gouna fell through. The move ends his week-long sojourn in Asia where he has been club hunting. Initially he was set to join Oman side Dhofar but the move hit a snag after both parties failed to agree on personal terms, according to the player's handlers. Dibba Club plays in the Arabian Gulf League and finished ninth on the 2017/18 season. They are currently second last on the 14-team log with no point after three rounds. The club, founded in 1976, lost 3-2 to Emirates in their last league match on Thursday. They play their home matches at a 10,645-seater Fujairah Club Stadium. Juma, who won the Kenyan Premier League Golden Boot last season while featuring for Kariobangi Sharks will hope to rediscover himself and return to the national team.   The 22-year-old bagged the Golden Boot with 17 goals in the 2017 KPL.
