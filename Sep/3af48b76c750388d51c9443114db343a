Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok said he will continue serving as Council of Governors chairman until his term ends in December when elections will be held. It was expected he would step down for his Kwale counterpart Salim Mvurya in July after it was agreed last year he would serve for six months before surrendering the position. "The law guiding the election of council officials does not provide provisions for a transition and it is envisaged that such voting is conducted after every one year," Mr Nanok said after a meeting on Monday. FUNDING COUNTIES At the same time, the Council asked the Senate to reject the Roads Bill over failure to raise the Road Maintenance Fuel Levy Fund allocation from 15 to 20 percent. "The Council notes with concern that despite the high-level negotiations and the signing of this agreement, the national government failed to honour its end of the bargain and the counties continue to grapple with the same challenges they have experienced over the last five years. "We are also concerned that three months into Financial Year 2018/19, only 25 counties have received partial funds for the first quarter. The slow disbursement hampers implementation of development projects," Mr Nanok said. Cumulatively by August 31, only Elgeyo-Marakwet, Embu, Isiolo, Kiambu, Laikipia, Lamu Migori, Mombasa, Murangâ€™a Narok, Samburu, Taita-Taveta, Tharaka-Nithi, Trans Nzoia and West-Pokot had received Sh4,031,939,826. On Monday, Bomet, Homabay, Kakamega, Kilifi, Kirinyaga, Kitui, Machakos, Marsabit, Meru and Nairobi received Sh4,346,906,994.   Sh77 billion for financial year which ends on June 30 yet to be released.
