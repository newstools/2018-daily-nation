DALLAS, TEXAS A Kenyan woman who was travelling to the United States from Nairobi to visit her family died aboard a plane on Tuesday less than an hour before it landed. According to the family, Hannah Kamau, a resident of Githunguri in Kiambu County, fell ill suddenly and died while on the flight to Dallas, Texas. The family said efforts by the cabin crew to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. “They told us that she developed shortness of [breath] and started gasping for air. [After collapsing, the cabin crew performed CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) that revived her. But after about ten minutes or so, she collapsed again and this time around they couldn’t revive her,” said Mr Patrick Nganga, her nephew who lives in Dallas. Her daughter, Ms Alice Kamau, told the Nation her mother had not complained of any signs of illness before she embarked on the journey in Nairobi. “I spoke to my mom just before she boarded the flight in Nairobi and she was in a jovial mood because she was finally coming over to see us, especially her grandchildren. At the time, she didn’t complain of anything. Therefore, it was a total shock to me when I was told that she had died,” said Ms Kamau. Ms Kamau said she was informed of her mother’s death by airport personnel where she was waiting to pick her up. The family is waiting for the autopsy report to know the cause of her death. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, September 23 at the Neema Gospel Church in Dallas, Texas.
