Hi,I went on a blind date with a guy I met on Tinder and he spent the whole time with his eyes glued on his phone, texting. I mentioned that it bothered me that he was texting while we were on a date but he said that he needed to be online. Now he has asked me out again and I really don’t want the same experience. When he is not on his phone, he is actually good company. Help me deal with this?  Is he on Tinder while you're on the date? Because that would be ironic. Here's the thing – being on the phone all through a first date shows extreme lack of interest. If he can't even be bothered to give a better first impression than the top of his head as he looks at his phone the whole time, then clearly he doesn't think your date is worth being offline for – what, one hour? Will he die because of not contributing to a trending topic for one hour? Nonsense. You deserve better than a date with a hairline. Make sure you tell him why you'd rather not, and ignore him if he says he'll change (they usually don't). Find someone else on Tinder – or Bumble – who actually wants to get to know you. Sometimes, a woman can compete with a man's hand. This isn't one of those times. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
