Muthaiga Golf Club's Greg Snow beat long-hitting Dismas Indiza in the third hole of a sudden death play-off to claim the second leg of the Safari Tour golf series at Vet Lab Sports Club course on Wednesday. At the end of regulation play of the fourth and final round, the two leading professionals had tied on six under par 282. The Mumias-based Indiza started the final round five shots off the leader Snow and one from Sigona's Sujan Shah. As was expected, Indiza, no doubt the most experienced professional golfer in the country, produced an impressive four under par 68, as the leader Snow carded one over par 73 with both finishing on the aggregate of 282. "I real didn't play as well as I expected to today and I must say I was lucky enough to have holed pars in the three holes of the play off. Probably this was meant to be my victory all along," said Snow, who picked the top prize of Sh150,000, while Indiza went home with Sh100,000. During the final round play, Snow levelled the first nine having birdied the second hole and dropped a shot at the par five-seventh. The back nine was not easy as well as he bogeyed the 10th, and parred the rest for his 73. "I missed several birdie opportunities but all the same, I know exactly what I need to do in the next event," added Snow. Indiza on the other hand, birdied both the two long holes in the front nine and the par four-ninth, but dropped a shot at the third hole while at the back nine, the 50 year-old Indiza picked up birdies at the 10th, 15th and parred the rest for his 68. "Today I was really firing as I knew I needed to play something like five under or so to catch up with Snow, but the bogey at the third messed up my chance and even in the play off, I wanted to drive on at the 18th but I pushed my driver, while the approach shot was not good enough," said Indiza, who however said his game was fine. "I just need to polish it up a bit for the Uganda Open and the other events''. Sigona's Sujan Shah, meanwhile shot level par 72 to finish on three under par total of 285 to drop to third place. He earned Sh80,000. Nelson Simwa, the only Vet Lab pro to make the second round cut, also shot level par 72 to remain in fourth place with four over par total of 292. Whilst Sujan Shah made two birdies both at the back nine and two bogeys, Simwa, who has been under the sponsorship of Betika, a betting company since the Kenya Open in March, dropped two shots at the first nine, where he birdied the first hole while at the back nine, Simwa, birdied the 11th and 12th, and was heading for an under par finish until he dropped a shot at the 17th. "I am working on some few areas to try and improve my performance particularly in the next events," said Simwa, who thanked his sponsors Betrika who have made it possible for him to play in all the tournaments this year including the forthcoming Uganda Open in Entebbe. The sponsorship deal covers transport, tournament entry fee, uniform and playing balls as well as caddie fees. Meanwhile, the third leg of the Safari Tour being organised by the Kenya Open Golf Limited will take place at Limuru Country Club from October 27 to 31, just a week after the Uganda Open.
