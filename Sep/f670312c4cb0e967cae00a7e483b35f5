The vivo X23 has been unveiled and it looks to be one of the best phones unveiled this year. Aesthetically, the X23 is one of the best looking phones in the market with a huge 6.41 inch 1080 x 2340 pixels resolution display, that has a tiny water drop like notch that houses the camera. It comes running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 670 chipset with an octa-core processor that is backed by 8GB of RAM. It as an Adreno 615 GPU, which gives it a silky smooth user experience, and aside from the physical specifications, it has Dual Turbo Acceleration Engine, something vivo says will improve performance. Storage is also plenty, with 128GB being offered as the standard but sadly, there will be no expansion via SD cards. The fingerprint sensor on this phone is well placed underneath the display which means that there is no sensor at the back. The rear camera array consists of a 12MP regular camera and a 13MP wide angle camera with LED flash, while at the front is a 12MP camera. WORTH THE COST As is becoming standard, all the cameras come with AI support, which improve image quality. It will come with a 3,400mAh battery that supports fast charge. It is a dual SIM phone, with LTE support, supports Bluetooth 5.0, 802.11 ac WiFi, and, surprisingly microUSB for charging and data access to the phone. Software-wise, this phone comes running Android 8.1 which is covered by vivo’s Funtouch OS 4.5, and as might be expected, vivo’s bloatware to boot. It isn’t a cheap mid-range phone, but it is certainly worth the cost. It looks good, runs fast, has a very nice feature-set. However, it has weird peculiarities, like using a microUSB to charge the phone, or the lack of an SD card slot, efforts aimed at keeping the phones costs low. That being said, this is certainly one of those phones you want to keep an eye out for. It is currently shipping and will set you back around Sh60,000.   The extra feature is available on the latest versions of WhatsApp.
