Egerton University acting Vice Chancellor (VC) Alexander Kahi cautioned students against having 'sponsors' in his first address after taking over from suspended VC Rose Mwonya. Addressing more than 3,000 first-year students during their orientation at the Njoro campus on Friday, Mr Kahi noted that this trend has ruined careers. WASTED TALENT “Today our female students proudly talk of sponsors while male students have sugar mummies. It has become normal," he said. "This should not happen at Egerton." The don further told the students to guard against "no development company", misplaced priorities and negative pressure. He said many talented people join universities but miss their targets for failing to observe rules and regulations. “I want you to remain university students, not students in the university. You came here to study so that is your core business. Avoid laziness and examination malpractices," Mr Kahi said. He also asked the students to pay tuition on time and shun gambling. “It is sad that some students get money from their parents to pay fees but gamble it away,” he said. “If you squander fees you will end up miserable as you will not register for examinations." SECURITY On security, the VC assured students of maximum protection while at the campus but urged them to cooperate with management by reporting suspicious activities. “Your security is paramount," he told them and added that they should use proper channels to solve their problems. “Avoid the use of riots and other methods that may lead to disturbances,” he said. This was Mr Kahi's first official duty following his appointment on September 10 after the suspension of Ms Mwonya. Ms Mwonya was sent on a 90-day compulsory leave on allegations of corruption concerning matters including management of finances and unplanned projects. She has denied the allegations and has asked a court to stop the university council from ejecting her.   Rose Mwonya was sent on leave over graft claims.
