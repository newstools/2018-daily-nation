Police in Kakamega County are holding a man who is suspected of killing his neighbour following a land dispute. Mr Fredrick Mangala, a resident of Irobo village in Museno sub-location, is alleged to have murdered Mr Fredrick Machanga after a misunderstanding over a piece of land. Shinyalu DCIO Paul Gathara said the deceased died after being shot in the chest. "The matter is outstanding and is in court. It was coming for hearing on September 25 but unfortunately the two parties engaged in fighting that has cost the life of one of them," Mr Gathara said. Mr Mangala surrendered himself to the police. A Ceska rifle was confiscated. ARGUMENT Locals said the land belonged to the deceased who inherited it from his late father, and that the assailant had encroached. The mother of the deceased, Margaret Harambee, said Mr Mangala visited their home at around 3pm, quarrelled with her son and then shot him. "One bullet missed our neighbour who had come to intervene. He continued to shoot in the air as he took off," Ms Harambee said. Idakho South MCA Farouk Machanje condemned the incident and called for thorough investigations.
