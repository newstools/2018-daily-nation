Wundanyi court has ordered two Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) #ticker:KCB workers arrested last week on suspicion of stealing Sh21 million detained for five more days to allow investigations to be completed. Resident Magistrate Emily Nyakundi said Mr Peter Ngoda and Benedict Mativo will remain in custody at Wundanyi police station until September 28. Magistrate Nyakundi said the detention will allow the prosecution to complete their investigations before they appear before her on Friday. The court issued the order after the prosecution council Jethron Okumu asked the magistrate to detain the two suspects longer to enable investigations to be completed. Mr Okumu noted that the investigations were wide and needed time to be exhausted. In the notice of motion to the court, he also noted that the two workers were the core suspects in the case of stealing by servant. The two were bank officials were responsible for the care and custody of the bank's safe between September 17-20. It is alleged that the funds went missing in the four days. “Leads pointing to the recovery of the cash have been established,” read the statement. Mr Ngoda and Mr Mativo were being held at Wundanyi police station pending investigations. Sources at the Criminal Investigation offices told the Nation that the prosecution had already established a strong case against the respondents. “The CCTV footage show that they were the ones who took the money,” said one of the officer who declined to be named because he was not allowed to talk to the media. The employees had reported to the manager that the codes had refused to open the safe which made the manager seek for assistance from their Nairobi headquarters offices. The manager then called the police who arrested the two senior staff on Friday.   Titus Murakaru Githui blames Kenyans for accepting and entrenching corruption and impunity.
