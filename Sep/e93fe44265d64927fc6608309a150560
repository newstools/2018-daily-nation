Former Rotterdam Marathon champion Marius Kimutai ex-World Half Marathon Championships bronze medallist Pascalia Jepkorir won the second edition of the Rabies Free Kenya 10km Road Run held in Nandi County on Saturday. Kimutai faced stiff competition from former Daegu Marathon champion Matthew Kisorio and Edward Kibet. He held them off to win the race in 27:07.2. Kisorio came in second, clocking 27:14.6 with Kibet rounding out the podium in 27:37.9. "The race was tough but my good preparations helped me. We were competing with some of the best marathoners and I'm happy to have won," said Kimutai, who is aiming to compete in an international marathon this season. "I was not ready for the race and my last minute decision brought good results. I was using it as part of my preparations to participate in this year's Valencia Marathon," said the Kapsabet-based Kisorio. Fresh from finishing second at the Chemususu Dam Half Marathon, Jepkorir ran shoulder-to-shoulder with Jepkemei after taking the lead four kilometres into the race. With 500m to go, she outsmarted Joyce Chepkemei with 500m and win in 32:12.0. Chepkemei was second in 32:22.0 with Betty Lembus third in 32:42.0. "I was using the race to taste waters as I am going to China for a marathon and this was part of my training," said Jepkorir. The race, which is part of a campaign to create awareness of rabies across the country, was started by Sharon Live On Foundation spearheaded by Barnabas Korir whose daughter Sharon was bitten by a dog in 2004 and later succumbed to the disease. "We are using the race to sensitise the public about the dangers of dog bites. We are happy the national and county governments are supporting us. We shall be going to different counties in a bid to popularise the initiative," said Korir.
