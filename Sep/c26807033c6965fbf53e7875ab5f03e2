Tuktuk operators in Mombasa county have hiked fares citing increase in fuel prices. Those riding for short distances will now pay Sh100 down from Sh50. Secretary General of Tuktuk Owners and Drivers Association (TODA), Mohammed Musa said the organisation is operating at low profit, forcing them to hike the fares. Mr Musa said the motor vehicles which are commonly used in the tourist hub have been operating on a standard rate of Sh50 for short distances since 2002. “At this rate, we are forced to increase the fares charged by the tuktuks. We will have to declare the new prices the tuktuks will be operating on,”Mr Musa said. But some operators within the central business district (CBD) have already up the fare to Sh100 from Sh50. The drivers held a demonstration within the CBD against the high prices of fuel.  Mr Joshua Otieno, a tuktuk driver said most petrol stations in the city have run out of fuel forcing them to overcrowd in a petrol station seeking for the commodity. “The petrol stations have run out of fuel. In addition, the express stations are crowded and one has to spend quality time there to get the commodity. Others, miss out and have to wait longer,” Mr Otieno added. Mr Otieno said the high fuel prices has slowed their operation. Customers are shying away from using the means of transport and instead opting for motorcycles whose prices are yet to be hiked following the imposed 16 per cent value added tax on fuel levy.   Treasury secretary Henry Rotich on Friday directed the Kenya Revenue Authority to effect the controversial, International Monetary Fund (IMF) fronted 16 per cent VAT on fuel.
