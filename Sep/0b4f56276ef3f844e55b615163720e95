Spanish La Liga side Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey has praised Harambee Stars striker Michael Olunga even as the clock ticks towards Saturday’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Group “F” qualifier at Kasarani Stadium. Oluga joined Japanese side Kashiwa Reysol from Chinese outfit Guanzhou Zchicheng in August signing a three-year deal. He has so far scored a goal and an assist in three league appearances. The former Gor Mahia man played for La Liga side Girona last season on loan from the Chinese club and according to Ghanaian star Partey, the player, whom he watched scoring a hat-trick in a 6-0 drubbing of Las Palmas in January, could be a threat in Saturday’s encounter. Kenya coach Sebastian Migne will bank on the lanky forward, who has 16 goals in 31 international games for Kenya, in search of goals. “Of course he is a good player, he scored goals in La Liga and we just need to be very careful and try to not give him any chance upfront,” said Partey, before their penultimate training session at Kasarani stadium on Friday. He added: “But this is a different game altogether, it’s not like in La Liga, the pitch is not the same and players are different too. We are prepared to win this game, I know it’s not going to be easy but we’ve got to do our job and try not to underrate the Kenyan team.” The 25-year-old has welcomed the responsibility to captain the four-time African champions in the absence of Turkish-based Asamoah Gyan. “On the captaincy it depends on the coach, I only try to do my work whenever I get the chance,” he offered. A win for the Black Stars will extend their lead at the top of the group to six points, with Ethiopia and second-placed Sierra Leone playing on Sunday in Addis.   The Black Stars are the overwhelming favourites.
