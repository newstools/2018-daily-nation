Two-time Toronto Marathon champion Philemon Rono and former World Cross Country junior bronze medallist Cynthia Jerop are the winners of inaugural edition of Kaptagat Forest Half Marathon. The race, which attracted elite athletes, was held under the theme ‘Sports for Conservation’ and saw athletes traverse two counties of Elgeyo Marakwet and Uasin Gishu before finishing the race at Strawbag in Uasin Gishu County on Sunday. Rono, who clocked 62 minutes and 23.6 seconds to win the men’s race, pulled away from the leading pack after 5km mark and led to the tape. “I ran race as part of my training as I prepare to contest for a third title in Toronto Marathon next month and I’m happy I was able to clinch victory. I now know where to rectify in the few days,” said Rono. Rono has been training in Kaptagat and he says that running with the best athletes in the world like Olympics marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge has motivated him to do better. After losing Kisii Half Marathon title last week, Cynthia Jerop won women’s title when after clocking 71:30. The reigning Hannover Half Marathon champion is now focusing on competing in Standard Chartered Marathon in Nairobi next month.
