Dear Brenda, My wife of 19 years has cheated on me many times with different men.  I'm sick and tired of being her husband. I don't feel like being intimate with her anymore. I have only been patient because of our children. I used to live with the children in Nairobi and she lived in our rural home but would often come to visit us. In August last year, I caught her red-handed in a compromising situation with a boy I consider my son. I later learnt that the affair had been going on for a while. My eldest son also confirmed this. I decided to bring her permanently to Nairobi to save our marriage, but again, I caught her red-handed kissing another man. Brenda, before we came to Nairobi, we had a lengthy discussion with her, my mother-in-law and her sister and she promised to change but this was not to be. I'm torn about whether I should leave her or not because I love my children dearly and I don’t want to be away from them. Please help me.  Well damn. Your wife is a cheater and she isn't going to stop. Kindly get evidence of her indiscretions and take her to court for a divorce as well as custody of the children – except the 'son' she is sleeping with, of course. If she won't stop sleeping around for herself, for you, for her children, for her family, for her pastor or her God, we're really beyond the option of logical debate and adult reasoning. Get pictures, letters, texts, emails – whatever you can get your hands on, and then make your case, quick. She doesn't really sound like she cares, so she may not even put up that much of a fight... *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   Thank God she isn't wearing that lingerie you so desire for anyone else.
