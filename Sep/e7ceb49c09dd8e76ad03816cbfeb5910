A post-mortem examination on the body of the 26-year-old woman who was abducted and killed early this week will begin at 2pm Friday at Rachuonyo Level Four Hospital in Homa Bay County. Close relatives of Ms Sharon Otieno, detectives and Chief Pathologist Johansen Oduor are at the mortuary for the examination which will last for about an hour. Emotions ran high when her family members, among them her mother, Melinda Auma, arrived at the mortuary, some minutes before noon. Lawyer Cliff Ombeta is also at the morgue. He told journalists that he was representing Migori Governor Okoth Obado's interests. A team of about 10 special investigative officers from Nairobi were at the Oyugi’s police station on Thursday but declined to comment on anything. According to sources, the team visited the morgue where they viewed Ms Otieno’s body and made notes. On Wednesday, Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti had promised crack the murder case of Ms Otieno in three days. He said he had dispatched a special team of homicide detectives to Homa Bay to investigate the murder. The detectives will also look into the attempted murder of Nation reporter Barrack Oduor, who escaped death narrowly. The team, Mr Kinoti said, will trace the events that led to the murder of the second-year Rongo University student whose body was found in a thicket near Kodera Forest in the wee hours of Wednesday. Already, key statements have been taken from some of the witnesses and some of the suspects are staring at arrest. "The investigators are waiting for the postmortem and DNA tests and we hope to get to the bottom of all this. Actually, we are at the tail-end,” Mr Kinoti told the Nation on phone, adding: "We cannot name the main suspect as at now but rest assured that no one will be spared.”   Migori governor did not travel to Rwanda as had been planned.
