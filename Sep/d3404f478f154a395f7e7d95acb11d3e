It is depressing Football Kenya Federation and a number of local football clubs continue to suffer financial distress arising from poor management and lack of foresight. Sports cannot develop in this country if the clubs cannot sustain themselves. Now, it is emerging Harambee Stars coach Sebastien Migne, who was appointed just four months ago, has not been paid for two months, yet the national team is preparing for crucial Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Ethiopia scheduled for next month. On top of that, the women’s premier league has failed to resume from the mid-season break in July due to lack of funds. Gor Mahia players have boycotted training for two weeks demanding payment of their August salaries and bonuses accrued over eight months, a situation that has seen them lose their last two games. SPONSOR FKF, the body mandated to run football in this country, is pointing fingers at the Sports ministry, accusing it of failing to advance them money meant to prepare the national team for the continental assignments. While this is understandable, it begs the question: How come the national team does not have a single sponsor? What was the wisdom in acquiring a second hand outside broadcasting van worth Sh130 million amid such dire financial straits? Managing the national team is the federation’s responsibility. It must always find ways of taking care of the team. And the trick is to have multiple sources of revenue to ease the burden on both government and the federation. That Uganda Cranes are bankrolled by Airtel, Nile Special, NIC bank and BUL while Harambee Stars have no financial partner is ridiculous. Someone is sleeping on the job.
