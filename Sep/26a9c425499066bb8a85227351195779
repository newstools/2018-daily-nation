The ongoing power struggle in cricket management in the country is worrying. Things seems to have worsened upon the resignation of Cricket Kenya Chairperson Jackie Janmohammed in February following the national team’s poor performance at ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament in Namibia. The federation’s director of development Abhijeet Raja Sarkar also handed in his resignation. Then Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa stepped in to appoint a Cricket Kenya Management Committee on April 4 chaired by Harpar Singh Sehmi to run Kenyan cricket on a caretaker basis. RESOLVE DISPUTE This seems not to have gone well with some stakeholders and clubs who sought legal redress at the Sports Dispute Tribunal that called for the constitution to be upheld. This included the filling in the positions of those officials, who had resigned. The game’s world governing body, ICC, has also added its voice calling for the dispute to be resolved immediately. It’s now five months since the caretaker committee was put in place but there seems to be no headway, hence the need for a Special General Meeting that should set a date for fresh elections. The push and pull is not helping the sport. Prompt action will be necessary. Let the SGM be held and team elected to steer the ship. A new and legally elected office that is devoid of vested interest will perhaps solve many problems.
