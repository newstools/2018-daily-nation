Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has formed a task force to look into the financial and management woes that plague Pumwani Maternity Hospital. The 13-member team made up of professionals from the Nairobi county government, academia and hospitals have 30 days to complete their investigations and compile a report on the reasons behind the referral hospital’s problems. MEMBERS The members of the task force are Mr Charles Kerich, the  acting county executive for Health, Dr John Nyamu, a gynaecologist, Dr Simon Mueke from the Ministry of Health and Prof Joseph Karanja, a lecturer from University of Nairobi's medical school. The Kenya Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society is represented in the team by Dr Anne Kihara, while the Kenya Medical Association has Dr Carol Odula. Pumwani Maternity Hospital Nursing School principal Mugure Kiambati will also be key in shedding light on the issues that hinder swift operations at the facility. Former Nairobi council administrators Joe Aketch and Nathan Kahara are also in the team as well as Mr David Kimaiyo, the former Inspector-General of Police and chairman of Kenyatta National Hospital Board, and KNH chief executive officer Thomas Mutie. Dr Evan Seqeuira and Bashir Admali of  Aga Khan University Hospital are also in the team. The  Matatu Welfare Association chairman, Mr Dickson Mbugua, will also play a part in the investigations. The team was set up following a visit to the hospital by Mr Sonko that revealed the lack of equipment and sufficient staff.   The board says five died under unclear circumstances, three were born dead and that four died in the first 24 hours of life.
