The Teachers Service Commission has until October 5 to address the problems facing tutors or face a strike that may paralyse national examinations. Kenya National Union of Teachers second women representative Jacinta Ndegwa said a weeklong retreat with TSC that begins on September 30 would determine the fate of the strike. The retreat will focus on delocalisation, promotions, deployment, Teachers Performance Appraisal And Development tool, new qualifications and other issues. Teachers are concerned that their employer is not stopped the delocalisation, defying President Uhuru Kenyatta’s call for a review of the programme about a month ago. ATTAINED CERTIFICATES According to Knut, delocalisation is destroying families. “From 2014, more than 30,000 teacher have gone back to college and attained certificates, diplomas and degrees but the best TSC can offer is acknowledgement letters. Some took loans to go back to school," Ms Ndegwa said during the Knut Busia branch AGM at St Catherine’s Special School in Butula Sub-County on Saturday. "Some teachers are too old to be transferred to far-flung areas. One wonders how a 58 year old will adapt to new conditions. Let the programme target new teachers.” TEACHER ASSESSMENT Ms Ndegwa asked TSC to keep off the assessment of teachers and let the Education Ministry's quality assurance department do that. She was speaking during the KNUT Busia Branch Annual General meeting held at St Catherine’s Special School in Butula on Saturday.   Teachers, on the other hand, are appraised on professional knowledge and its application.
