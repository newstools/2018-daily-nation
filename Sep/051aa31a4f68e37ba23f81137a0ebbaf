Migori Governor Okoth Obado has been arrested over the murder of his pregnant girlfriend Sharon Otieno. Mr Obado was on Friday morning grilled by detectives at the headquarters of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Kiambu Road in Nairobi. He spent the better part of the morning with detectives and sources told the Nation that he was expected to record a statement on the matter. His arrest comes a day after detectives and government scientists confirmed that the baby boy ripped from Ms Sharon Otieno’s womb was his, thus putting the Migori governor at the heart of investigations into the abduction and killing of the Rongo University student. The foetus died after the mother was stabbed eight times while seven months pregnant. A postmortem report indicated that the fatal blow to the baby was a single knife stab through Ms Sharon's abdomen. Police sources told the Nation that the governor is now a person of interest in the investigation and will have to record another statement in Nairobi, alongside his wife Hellen. Mr Obado last week recorded a statement in Kisumu. Earlier, detectives investigating the gruesome murder of the 26-year-old student had indicated that the governor's wife was a person of interest after suspects named her close associates in the horrendous scheme. However, police postponed her scheduled interrogation at the DCI headquarters, as the investigators gathered more evidence from suspects already in custody and awaited reports from the Government Chemist. The governor has not denied siring the slain baby boy but he has denied having a hand in the woman's murder. Five other suspects— including Mr Obado's personal assistant Michael Oyamo, bodyguard Elvis Omondi and a clerk in the county Caspal Obiero— are in police custody over the gruesome murder that Nation journalist Barack Oduor escaped by a whisker.   Sleuths turn focus on those close to the governor, including his wife and aides, say motive for murder seems clear.
