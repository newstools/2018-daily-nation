Nairobi County Assembly risks being denied audience by the Labour Court for failing to allow Speaker Beatrice Elachi access to her office. Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, Ms Elachi said she has been denied entry by MCAs despite obtaining an order suspending her impeachment. Justice Maureen Onyango directed Mr Kinyanjui to file a report with deputy registrar of the Employment and Labour Relations Court by Tuesday evening to confirm whether Ms Elachi has been allowed to enter the office. The judge said she might deny the assembly audience if the MCAs fail to comply with the order. Last week, the court dismissed objections raised by the assembly including the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case. The court ruled that the case was rightly filed and that legal points raised by MCAs should be addressed during the hearing. The MCAs through lawyer Tom Ojienda argued that orders issued stopping Ms Elachiâ€™s removal amounted to reinstating her to the position before the case was determined. Ms Elachi filed the case on September 6 and obtained orders stopping the MCAs from removing her as the Speaker and appointing a new nominee to the position. The case will be heard on September 28.
