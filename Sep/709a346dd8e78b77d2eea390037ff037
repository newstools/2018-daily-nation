Police in Kakamega are holding a man who attacked and killed his neighbour following a land dispute. Mr Fredrick Mangala, a resident of Irobo village in Kakamega County allegedly murdered Mr Fredrick Machanga on Friday after a misunderstanding over a piece of land. Shinyalu DCIO Mr Paul Gathara said Mr Machanga died on the spot after being shot in the chest. “The matter is in court. It was to be heard on September 25 but unfortunately, the two parties engaged in a fight that has cost the life of one of them,” said Mr Gathara. Mr Mangala surrendered to the police after shooting his neighbour to death. Mr Gathara said police recovered a spent cartridge at the scene of the incident. SURRENDERED TO THE POLICE “We have confiscated the Ceska pistol from the suspect after he surrendered to the police,” said Mr Gathara. Local residents said the land belonged to the deceased who inherited it from his late father. Ms Margaret Harambee, the mother of the deceased, said the assailant visited their home at around 3pm on Friday and engaged in a quarrel with her son before he shot him. “One bullet missed our neighbour who had come to intervene. Mr Mangala continued to shoot in the air as he sped off,” said Ms Harambee. HAPHAZARD LAND TRANSACTIONS Idakho South MCA Farouk Machanje condemned the incident and called on the police to investigate the murder. He blamed Museno Assistant Chief Mr Harrington Ingaya for failing to control haphazard land transactions in the area. The incident comes three months after police officers were injured and the administrator’s house burnt down by irate members of the public after police exhumed a body from a disputed piece of land.
