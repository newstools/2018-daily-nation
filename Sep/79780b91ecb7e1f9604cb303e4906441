Michael Oyamo, Migori Governor Okoth Obado personal assistant accused by the state of murdering his boss’ pregnant girlfriend Sharon Otieno, has denied the charge. Mr Oyamo pleaded not guilty when he appeared before the High Court Judge Jessi Lesiit in the capital Nairobi on Tuesday. Like his boss who also denied the murder charge on Monday, Mr Oyamo, who was among the first suspects to be arrested, applied to be freed on bond. The prosecution accused him of luring Ms Otieno from her parents’ home in Homa Bay County to Rongo, Migori, from where she and Nation journalist Barrack Oduor were handed over to killers. In documents filed in court, Mr Oyamo made a false report at Uriri Police Station that he had been kidnapped. The document reveal that he made the report on September 4 after luring and handing over the two to the abductors on September 3. According to the investigating officer, the accused lied that he was kidnapped and that he just found himself at Kisii Level 5 Hospital being treated at 9am. However, investigation revealed that Mr Oyamo was never a patient at the said facility on the said date. "The accused person played a key role in the planning and eventual execution of the deceased and her unborn child," said the investigating officer. He added: "the state has evidence which links the accused person and his accomplices to the commission of the heinous crime." Prosecution now wants him denied bond pending trial on grounds that his character and conduct confirms that he is a person who cannot be trusted. The court is set to hear Mr Oyamo’s bond request this afternoon. Mr Oyamo was rearrested moments after being freed by police in Homa Bay on Tuesday last weeks and flown to Nairobi.   Auma is yet to come to terms with the tragic death of her daughter.
