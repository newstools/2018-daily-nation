Three people, including a police officer, were killed on Wednesday during running battles in Kenyenya, Kisii County, as residents protested the killing of a conductor. Two police officers and a student were also injured in the fracas on Wednesday afternoon. OFFICER CORNERED The conductor was shot dead by police who had been trailing him to Magenche area, a shopping centre three kilometers from Kenyenya town. Villagers said he took a car to Magenche where a driver had been waiting for him to pick a group of men for a journey. The conductor refused to stop when police officers flagged him down but was eventually caught and hit with the butt of a gun. Acting Kisii County Police Commander Francis Nguli said a statement will be issued once they have all the details. He confirmed the death of the officer but said he did not have information regarding his rank. The policeman was cornered after his gun ran out of bullets as he quelled the protests. He fled in the direction of Kerongorori river bank where he was killed. POLICE PROFESSIONALISM In a joint statement, county leaders termed the incident unfortunate, noting that residents are peace-loving. The statement was signed by Governor James Ongwae, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Senator Sam Ongeri and MPs Sylvanus Osoro (South Mugirango), Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South) and Jimmy Angwenyi (Kitutu Chache North). "We expect the police force in the region to conduct themselves in a professional manner," the statement said.
