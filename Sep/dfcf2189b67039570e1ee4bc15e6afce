Garissa Governor Ali Korane on Sunday denied taking part in the attempted murder of former Finance Executive Idris Muktar. Speaking during a prize giving day at Dertu Secondary School in Dadaab, Mr Korane said he had nothing to do with the incident and nothing to gain from Mr Muktar's death. The Governor said he only became a person of interest following the accusations. "I had absolutely nothing to do with man who was shot. I had no problem whatsoever with him but unfortunately people had to link me with the incident," Mr Korane said. "Because there was a lot of propaganda that I was involved in this case, I was only required to tell police what I know. I was only questioned for 39 minutes, contrary to rumours that I was arrested," he added. EDUCATION CERTIFICATE Mr Muktar was shot two weeks ago in Naiorbi's Kileleshwa. He is in a coma at Nairobi Hospital with a bullet lodged in his head. Dismissing claims that Mr Muktar was attacked because he planned to challenge his academic credentials, Mr Korane said he has not presented any master's degree certificate to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as it has been reported. "These stories that are being peddled that the university rejected my master's certificate are untrue. I have never presented a master's certificate to the IEBC, and if there is any then it must have been done by someone else but not me." He also said he has no pending case challenging his election. He was accompanied by Senator Yusuf Haji, county assembly speaker Ahmed Ibrahim Abass, among other leaders.   Fredrick Ngandiâ€™s family says the police have since remained quiet about the murder.
