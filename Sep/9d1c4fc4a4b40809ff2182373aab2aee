Bus companies have increased their fares following a hike in fuel prices. In Kisii, some travellers in Kisii were forced to postpone their journeys. Even transport firms like Transline and Premium, whose fares had remained constant over the years, caved in to the pressure and increased fares. They will now be charging Sh1,000 to and from Nairobi, up from Sh800. Transline boss Erick Kombo said the changes took effect on Sunday morning. He asked the government to reduce the prices so that the welfare of ordinary citizens can improve. "We had no problem if it was VAT but now it is about fuel prices, which ordinarily dictate everything in the market," Mr Kombo said. But, he said, the cost of transporting luggage by the firm will not change. PEACE DEAL Premium company manager Gerald Omambia said some travellers opted to defer their journeys. "It (fuel hikes) came hard on them because they didnâ€™t not expect the fares to be this high. A few others have however begun to understand why we took this decision," Mr Omambia said. The firm also increased fares by Sh100 and Sh200 to be in line with the new reality. Nyamira and Otange bus companies also upped fares by Sh100 and Sh200. Mr Francis Ongeri, a traveller, slammed the peace deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga, saying the cost of living has worsened. CONSULTATION National Matatu Organising Secretary Victor Manoti said they have instructed their members to increase prices. "We now allow our members to raise fares to cushion themselves against the rise in fuel prices," he told the Nation on phone. Mr Manoti called for consultations before such decisions are made. "Before a decision like this is arrived at, let the players in the sector be called to a roundtable meeting to talk," he said. Also boda boda operators in Kisii have increased their charges.   Decision to effect 16pc VAT ignored attempts by MPs to delay the law by two years.
