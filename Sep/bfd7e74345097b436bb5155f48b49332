Tana River assembly members want the clerk’s office to provide CCTV and a report after a beheaded cat was found in the premises on August 22. In an address to the county assembly on Tuesday, Leader of Majority Salah Adamo said the matter ought to be taken seriously and demanded quick investigations to establish how the cat ended up in the clerk’s office and how it met its death. “Mr Speaker, this matter has been taken lightly and dismissed like it means nothing when what is in the public domain has created a lot of worry, therefore it should not be taken lightly. We demand a comprehensive explanation, and a CCTV footage on what transpired,” he said. Mr Adamo said the public needs to be informed about what transpired as much as members of the county assembly need to be assured of their security. The majority leader said the beheading of the cat in the clerk's office could cause fear especially if it was intended as a message to an individual. The MCA demanded that assembly staff explain how the cat got into the offices whose windows have grills and are always locked, and how many they were as since the House does not rear cats in the compound. He noted that easy access by animals to the premises was a compromise to their security. “If such animals can get into guarded offices, then there are chances that one can easily plant an explosive in our offices and simply walk away without notice,” said Mr Adamo.
