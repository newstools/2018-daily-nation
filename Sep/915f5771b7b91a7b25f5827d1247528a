Migori Governor Okoth Obado has said he had "nothing and absolutely nothing" to do with the brutal murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. Mr Obado addressed the press amid speculation on Wednesday, as he has been adversely mentioned in the matter. NO SPECULATION The Governor spoke at Serena Hotel in Nairobi County flanked by his wife Hellen Okoth, daughter Evaline Okoth and son Jerry Okoth. "I ask all agencies involved to speed up investigations so the killers are brought to book as quickly as possible," he said in his short address to journalists. He sent a condolence message to the family and asked politicians and members of the public to stop the speculation. Mr Obado, his personal assistant Michael Oyamo and Nation journalist Barrack Oduor were questioned at the Nyanza headquarters of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations on Tuesday. After about eight hours of grilling, the Governor was whisked away to an unknown location in a police car.   High Court orders his lock-up for a further 14 days.
