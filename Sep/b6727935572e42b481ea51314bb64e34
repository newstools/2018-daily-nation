State agencies have waived penalties on overstayed cargo and ordered owners to evacuate their freight within two weeks as authorities fight to clear congestion at the port and inland depots. The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) have asked all cargo owners to clear their consignments within the waiver period or have the goods auctioned or destroyed. The two agencies said they had issued the waiver of storage charges and customs warehouse rent for long stay cargo for 14 days effective yesterday. “Accordingly, the KPA will waive all storage charges accrued on long stay cargo that will have been cleared with effect from today,” said the agency in a media notice yesterday. “Similarly, the KRA will waive all customs warehouse rent on all long stay cargo that will have been cleared within this period both at Mombasa port and Inland Container Depot Nairobi.” According to the custom house regulations, cargo is declared to have stayed long after spending 21 days and above at the facility. The parastatals said the move would enhance operational efficiency at the cargo yards and faster turnaround time of rail services between Mombasa and Nairobi depot. The KPA aims to transport 12 trains of cargo by December. Currently, it operates between seven and eight trains a day.   According to SCEA, KPA and shipping lines should start counting the free period days for all cargo when goods land at ICDN.
