Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations have arrested a police officer suspected to be among the four who robbed a Mali national of Sh900,000 on Saturday. Mr Bathily Abdoulaye reported to the DCI in Kilimani, Nairobi, that four police officers arrested him at his house in Kilimani. RANSACKED HOUSE He added that the officers ransacked his house and took away 8,000 US dollars, Sh83,000, three Rolex watches each valued at Sh150,000 and his passport. Mr Abdoulaye further alleged that one of the officers transferred Sh30,000 to his phone. “The complainant (Abdoulaye) said he was later, after the arrest, escorted to Central Police Station where he was later released without being officially booked in the Occurrence Book,” a statement from the DCI said. He told detectives that even after ransacking his house and taking his valuables, the police officers continued to demand for another Sh800,000. When he reported the matter, officers from the DCI laid an ambush and arrested a man who had been sent to collect the money from the complainant at Yaya Centre. ARRESTED The man led the detectives to Central Police Station where they arrested the police officer. “The passport of the complainant was recovered from the police officer. The Flying Squad is still looking for the other rogue officers including one driver attached to the County Criminal Investigations Office in Nairobi area,” the DCI said. The arrest comes two days after two police officers and seven civilians were arrested in connection with a robbery at a home in Olenguruone, Nakuru County. Police on Tuesday named the officers attached to the DCI in Molo and Kamara divisional headquarters. The two are accused of jointly with seven people robbing the home of Mr Eliud Langat last Friday. The suspects were arrested by Flying Squad officers after the magazine of a gun assigned to one of the officers was recovered at the scene of the crime.
