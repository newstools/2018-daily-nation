Mr Michael Juma Oyamo, the suspect held in connection to the murder of university student Sharon Otieno, has appeared before a Homa Bay court. Donning a stripped white-blue stripped shirt, grey jumper, brown khaki trousers and brown pair of shoes, Mr Oyamo was dragged into the courtroom by more than five officers. The officers ensured he was placed in the hands of Resident Magistrate Lester Simiyu safely even as mobs that gathered outside the court bayed for his blood. He sat pensively in the dock looking tired, gloomy and unsettled. Efforts by the magistrate to have him speak and maybe raise any concerns bore no fruit as he remained silent just gazing at the court officials.   The former military man looked powerless and helpless on the other side of law. During the Monday session, the prosecution, led by Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Tom Imbali, sought to extend Mr Oyamoâ€™s lock-up until Monday to enable detectives wrap up their investigations. The case, they said, is complicated and they need more time to analyse data and DNA samples they extracted from the suspect. But defence lawyers Neville Amollo, June Ashioya, Rogers Miisai opposed the request, saying the the court was being treated to fresh applications on a matter that was argued and a ruling made last week.   They argued that the prosecution has had enough time to conduct investigations, and that the prosecution did not give compelling reasons why Mr Oyamo should be kept in custody for longer. They asked the magistrate to reject the application and grant Mr Oyamo freedom. They argued that the investigators violated rights of the accused by extracting DNA samples illegally. The defence also challenged the jurisdiction of the magistrate court to hear the murder case, saying only High Court is fit to handle the matter. Ms Simiyu, the magistrate, adjourned the case to 1pm when she will make a ruling.   Bernard Okuta believes the killers will be unmasked.
