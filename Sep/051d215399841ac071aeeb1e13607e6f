Perhaps the score line or rather the result would have been different if Ulinzi Stars played their SportPesa Shield semi-final against Kariobangi Sharks at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos. Ulinzi Stars coach Dunstan Nyaudo conjured up a raft of reasons for his side's 4-1 loss key among them the change of venue. The game had earlier been scheduled for Machakos before Football Kenya Federation (FKF) moved it to Kasarani on Thursday. “Of course as a coach, you’ve to plan for the game knowing the pitch you are going to play but once there’s a change, it interferes with your plan. Look at Kasarani and Machakos, two different pitches but I was told earlier that Kariobangi Sharks were very much worried about playing us in Machakos,” griped a visibly frustrated Nyaudo. Cliff Kasuti's late consolation was the only positive from a lacklustre Ulinzi side and Nyaudo singled out fatigue and injuries for the lifeless display. “I am squarely going to blame congestion of fixtures and injuries for the loss, we’ve had so many matches in the last two weeks and this was certainly going to wear out my players. They (Sharks) had a better afternoon and deserved to win,” he added while congratulating Sharks for a wonderful job. Sharks coach William Muluya refused to bask in the near perfect performance from his charges, shifting focus to the October 20 final against Sofapaka. “We need to look at our weaknesses from the game, stick more to the positives as we prepare for the final,” he said. “What’s even interesting is that there’s cohesion, coordination in the team with everyone supporting each other. The attackers are also doing their job, we need to accomplish this further,” he pointed out in anticipation of his second domestic cup final.   Elli Asieche came off the bench to score the winner with only 11 minutes left.
