For two countries that enjoy cordial relations and deep economic ties, the apparent failure to resolve a simmering dispute over the one-acre piece of rock in Lake Victoria that is Migingo Island is an indictment of the leadership. The controversy has raged for several years, yet the very top leaders of Kenya and Uganda, including Presidents Uhuru Kenyatta and Yoweri Museveni, meet frequently and are in constant communication. SECURITY PRESONNEL With some overzealous junior Ugandan border security personnel reported to be engaging in provocative actions such as arresting Kenyan fishermen and generally needlessly flexing muscles on the island, we are left wondering whether the East African Community, in which both countries are pivotal members, still has a role to play. Or could it be the case that the dispute has not been formally reported to the EAC? The last time there was a flare-up over Migingo several years ago, the authorities in both countries pledged to have the border delineated to put to rest the ownership dispute. TRADING PARTNER How come the report has never been made public? But there is absolutely no reason why an agreement cannot be reached to enable the citizens of both countries to exploit the rich fishing potential for mutual gain. Uganda has traditionally been Kenyaâ€™s major trading partner and the ongoing development of transport and other infrastructure is indicative of increasing co-operation and a firm resolve to work together for regional prosperity. Efforts to ease travel and the transportation of goods through the establishment of one-stop border points confirm this commitment. Pesky junior officials must not be allowed to create unnecessary tension and sour the good relations. Any disputes that arise must be amicably resolved to avoid conflict and enhance co-operation.
