Migori Governor Okoth Obado has been whisked away from Nyanza Regional DCI offices after more than six hours of questioning. His lawyer Cliff Ombeta said on Tuesday that his client cooperated with investigators and that he will defend himself against any allegations over the death of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. The legal team has, however, declined to explain why Mr Obado left the station in a police car. "Our client was not arrested. He came here to give his statement and that is what he has done," Mr Ombeta said. The Governor is also being represented by lawyer Rogers Sagana.
