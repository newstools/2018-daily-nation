Hi, I asked my girlfriend to start showering twice a day. She said that she will only shower twice if I do so too. I am a bit frustrated because I know women need hygiene more than men do. I even send her links about cleanliness for women in an attempt to persuade her, but we end up arguing instead. It is now becoming a big issue. Please advise.   I am not understanding the issue exactly. Do you live in a dusty area? In which case, you need to shower twice too, and she has a valid point in her comeback. Or is it that she has body odour and you are masking it with these articles you are sending her? If you want someone to change their behaviour based on what you think, that's one thing, but if there's a deeper issue, please present facts to her instead of beating around the bush. If your girlfriend smells unhygienic, tell her so. You can go with her to buy her deodorant, or figure out if it is a dermatological issue. There are many options available, once you figure out what the actual problem is. For the record, everyone needs to shower â€“ ask yourself why you think your girlfriend needs to shower more than everyone else. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
