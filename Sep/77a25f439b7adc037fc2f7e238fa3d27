Nation Media Group (NMG) Mombasa football team stretched their unbeaten run to four matches when they held Total Kenya to a one-all draw during a Left Foot League match played at Burhaniya Sports Club last weekend. Both goals came in the second half with NMG scoring through Kevin Mutiso while Michandanda Dusaba levelled for Total in the dying minutes of the game. The game started at a cracking pace with the first real chance falling to NMG striker Abubakar Kibuda in the ninth minute but his shot was parried for an abortive corner by Total goalkeeper Sammy Nduati. Total could have taken the lead in the 22nd minute when a fine combination between Said Ali, Dusaba and Harun Yusuf culminated in Justin Bebeto sending a cracking shot that was brilliantly saved by NMG goalkeeper Ibrahim Salim. It was in the second half that NMG took the lead 10 minutes after the restart when Mutiso was put through by Brian Ocharo and sent a low shot past Nduati. Total fought hard and were rewarded when they forced the NMG defence to an error late on. Dusaba took full advantage to beat Salim from close range. NMG team manager Lucas Barasa was impressed with his team saying they will perform better in the second leg to make amends for losses suffered in the first leg. “Our players have improved a lot after taking training seriously. We lost matches in the first leg because we weren’t training together but now teams playing us should be prepared and expect tough matches,” said Barasa.
