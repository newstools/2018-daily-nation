The Teachers Service Commission branch in Embu has raised alarm over con men targeting school heads. TSC acting director Aneriko Maloba said the fraudsters promise favourable treatment from the employer at a fee, particularly on matters concerning the delocalisation policy. Mr Maloba said two principals have already fallen victims. "Con men are on the prowl and they like escalating their game this term by telling teachers that they were to be delocalised or can't get infrastructure funds. They are claiming that they are from TSC and want to help the targeted principals. This is a con game," Mr Maloba said during the retirement party for former county TSC director Janet Onyango at Canaan Guest Resort. VITAL INFORMATION Embu Education director Margaret Mwirigi cautioned teachers against rash disclosing of crucial information such as passwords, payslips or evaluation materials at cyber cafes, where they can easily be accessed by fraudsters. Ms Onyango, who retired last month, encouraged her former colleagues to embrace the delocalisation scheme to promote cohesion. "When I was transferred to Embu [from Kakamega at 58 years] I felt bad, but I told myself that I was being selfish. I asked myself, 'if not me, then who?' There are directors who are being transferred yet they have young families. Never resist some of these things because you donâ€™t know what God wants to do for you," she said. Ms Onyango also encouraged them to sign performance contracts.
