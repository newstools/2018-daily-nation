Police on Sunday shot and killed two suspected members of a gang in Kisauni, Mombasa. Kisauni OCPD Sangura Musee said the two are believed to be part of a gang that hacked to death Mr Mohamed Mwatsahu, a member of a peace committee, on Thursday night. "The two were killed while armed with machetes and they tried to rob people near Kongowea market," Mr Sangura said. Police sources have said one of the suspects is nicknamed "Governor", and has been on their radar over a series of attacks in Kisauni. Mr Mwatsahu was attacked outside his home in Kisauni. He succumbed to his injuries while en route to a hospital. JUSTICE Mombasa Peace Committee chairman Feisal Bahero had called for the arrest of the culprits during a meeting with Senator Mohammed Faki, Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir and Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid on Sunday. "No person, youth or aged, should be allowed to get away with acts of violence such as the one witnessed in the past week. The police must find justice for the family of the victim and the community at large," Mr Bahero said at Haki Africa offices. Mr Khalid said any one committing a crime should be held accountable.
