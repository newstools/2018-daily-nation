Police in Tharaka-Nithi county are holding a form three student on claims that he murdered his classmate on Saturday evening. The body of 17-year old boy Lewis Muthomi was found lying in a pool of blood at Magutuni market in Maara sub-county on Sunday evening. FIGHT FOR WOMAN Residents alerted Kiera chief Protasio Mutembei after finding the body of the student of Maguma Day Secondary School. One, who did not want to be named, said the schoolmates had fought earlier in the day over a woman who works at a bar at the market. “After fighting, the suspect left but returned at around 9pm. He stabbed his classmate in the neck with a knife,” the resident said. Police were informed of the murder of Mr Muthomi at around 10 pm. KNIFE ATTACK Speaking to journalists at his office in Chogoria town, Maara OCPD Johnston Kabusia noted, however, that they had not received reliable information on the circumstances around the murder. Mr Kabusia said the deep cut on the front side of the victim's neck indicated that a knife was used in the attack. Officers from Chogoria Police Station arrested the suspect at his home in Maara sub-county that evening, where they found a blood-stained knife and clothes. The OCPD asked residents to help them and said investigators would ask the court for more time to hold the student for investigations. Some villagers attributed the crime to the consumption of illicit brews at the market and asked police to arrest the brewers. The body was taken to the mortuary at Chuka County Referral Hospital.   The victim's friend says they were attacked with pangas shortly after leaving the bar.
