Q. I enjoy baking. I read a story of a lady who sells her cakes online and this inspired me a lot. I would like to start selling my cakes online to earn some pocket money as I am still in campus. I am however concerned about my safety when it comes to home deliveries since my customers will be strangers. Please advise.  First of all, before you start selling cakes online, ensure that you have a market and a product that clients have already tasted and can recommend. Reviews from existing clients can help attract more clients online. Once you have these basics sorted out, you can now look at your safety concerns. The online market has enabled sellers to reach many more buyers whom they might not reach day-to-day, but as you mention, there are some safety concerns. Here are some things you can do to ensure safety during home deliveries: Have a plan to make deliveries during the day when there is still light and avoid carrying large amounts of money or more than required. You can give an option of mobile money payments to avoid carrying a lot of money on you. You can also have someone accompany you to the deliveries. Lastly, if something doesnâ€™t feel right, you are better safe than sorry. For instance, avoid delivering to a house that looks vacant or one in a secluded place. You can also have deliveries done at a public halfway point, where there are other people around. All the best! *** Do you have a business question?
