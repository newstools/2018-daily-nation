The High Court has allowed police to detain Mr Michael Oyamo, one of the key suspects in the murder of pregnant university student Sharon Otieno, for a further 14 days. Mr Oyamo, Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s personal assistant, will be held at the Muthaiga Police Station, Judge Luka Kimaru directed. Mr Oyamo was on Wednesday morning brought to the High Court in Milimani, Nairobi, where he faced a murder charge. The charge stated that on the night of September 3 and 4, he and others murdered Ms Otieno at Owande area in Rachuonyo, Homa Bay County. The charge was read to him but he was not required to plead. Mr Oyamo was re-arrested moments after being freed by police in Homa Bay on Tuesday and flown to the capital. Homa Bay County police commander Marius Tum on Tuesday confirmed that Mr Oyamo was released “unconditionally” in compliance to the court order issued by Senior Resident Magistrate Lester Simiyu. There were plans to arraign him at the High Court in Homa Bay but he was moved to Nairobi after the public bayed for his blood during his appearance at the magistrate court. On Tuesday, similar crowds formed outside the High Court, with locals pushing their way into the courtroom. Police said Mr Oyamo was moved the city "for his own safety". He is among persons who were last seen with Ms Otieno before her lifeless body was found at Kodera Forest in Oyugis, Homa Bay County, a day after she was kidnapped. Nation journalist Barrack Oduor, who was abducted with Ms Otieno, escaped death after jumping out of the abductor’s moving vehicle.     Is he under arrest or just enjoying better security? Police cagey on governor’s status.
