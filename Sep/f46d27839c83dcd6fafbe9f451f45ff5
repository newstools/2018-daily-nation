NEW YORKNaomi Osaka became the first Japanese woman to win a Grand Slam title as her idol Serena Williams imploded in the face of a code violation from the chair umpire on Saturday. Osaka, 20, triumphed 6-2, 6-4 in the match marred by Williams's second set outburst, the American enraged by umpire Carlos Ramos's warning for receiving coaching from her box.She tearfully accused him of being a "thief" and demanded an apology from the official.   Nadal's challenge was ruined by a knee injury after just four games.
