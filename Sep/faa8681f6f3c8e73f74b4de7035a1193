More details have emerged about the brutal killing of Sharon Otieno, who was abducted and killed earlier this week. Ms Otieno’s body had stab wounds in the back, neck and hands, her close relative, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Nation.co.ke. He said part of her intestines were ripped out. The relative said it was clear that Ms Otieno’s killer(s) not only wanted to kill her but wanted her seven-month-old unborn child dead too. Police said Ms Otieno, 26, was likely raped before she was brutally murdered. Used condoms were found near where her body was found.   A post-mortem on Ms Otieno’s body was underway Friday afternoon at Rachuonyo Level Four Hospital in Homa Bay County. Her close relatives, detectives and Chief Pathologist Johansen Oduor were at the mortuary for the examination, which began at 2pm. Emotions ran high when her family members, among them her mother, Melinda Auma, arrived at the mortuary, some minutes before noon. Lawyer Cliff Ombeta was also at the morgue. He told journalists that he was representing Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s interests.
