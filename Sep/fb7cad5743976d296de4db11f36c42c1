Changawa siblings Ismail and Shufaa are determined to recapture their Britam Kenya Open men Tennis championship men and women's title when the competition serves off from September 15-22 at the Nairobi Club. Ismail, who lost out in the semi-final last year, said he is in the best form ever, having propelled Kenya to Davis Cup Group III victory three months ago, before winning gold at the East Africa Community Games two weeks ago in Burundi. It wasn't an all gloom for Ismail, as he managed to bounce back and win the Rwanda, Malawi and Karen Open last year. “Our Davis Cup and regional games' exploits this year explain my current form. I was born ready,” said Ismail, who won back-to-back Kenya Open titles from 2014 to 2016. The US-based player, who has also ventured into the world of music, said he also hopes to toss to victory by entertaining his fans with his single Feezy. The single is part of the 12 songs that are on his debut album set for release on September 28 this year. Shufaa, 24, who won the women’s championships in in 2011, 2014 and 2016, disclosed Thursday that she has recovered from a right shoulder injury and is ready to battle. “I haven’t recovered 100 percent from the shoulder injury I sustained in December, but I am a fighter and my opponents should be ready for a good show from me,” said Shufaa, who lost to the eventual winner Natali Coronel of Argentina in the semi-finals, last year. Shufaa predicted a tough battle from the likes of compatriots Sneha Kotecha and Angela Okutoyi as well as Aisha Niyonkuru from Burundi. Ismail is among three players going for another victory at Kenya Open including defending champion Duncan Mugabe from Uganda and Edgar Kazembe of Zambia. Mugabe is currently in the United States taking part in Futures Tournaments. The tournament received a major boost Wednesday from sponsors Britam, who unveiled a Sh3 sponsorship. Tennis Kenya vice chairman Francis Mutuku disclosed that the tournament has attracted over 250 players drawn from 11 countries in East and Central Africa. Kenya will be eying to reclaim both the men and women’s titles in the tournament that’s has drawn players from Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Malawi and South Sudan. Mugabe and Coronel won the men and women's singles titles last year, with the Ugandan beating Kenya's Sheil Kotecha 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 in the men's final, as Coronel edged out Gabon's Celestine Avomo Ella 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 in the women's affair. Seniors’ fray will be preceded by the Britam Kenya Open Junior Championships due for this weekend at the Nairobi Club. Mutuku said they have incorporated a section for development, which will target youngsters aged below 10, eight and six and beginners. The tournament’s referee is Patrick Kamuhia, while Rose Wanjala is the championships’ director.
