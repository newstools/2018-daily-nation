President Uhuru Kenyatta has returned Finance Bill, 2018, to Parliament, meaning the 16 per cent fuel VAT has not been suspended. The President received the Bill earlier on Thursday, amid worry and criticism of the government about the high cost of living and higher fuel prices. SPECIAL SITTINGS The Bill on the tax for petroleum products was passed two weeks ago. Following the President's decision, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi issued a notice of special sittings to discuss it. Mr Muturi has recalled MPs from recess by way of the special gazette notice dated September 13. The notice states that the Bill will be reconsidered by Parliament with the reservations of the President and in line with Article 115 (2), (3) and (5) of the Constitution and the report of the relevant committee. “Pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 29(3) of the Standing Orders of the Members of the National Assembly, it is notified that special sittings of the Assembly shall be held in the National Assembly Chamber in the Main Parliament Buildings, on Tuesday, September 18 and on Thursday, September 20,” states the document that was quickly circulated on social media. The Tuesday sitting will take place at 2.30pm while the Thursday sittings will take place at 9.30am and 2.30pm. Earlier, legislators pointed fingers at Mr Muturi, saying he took too long to hand the Bill to the President. Some piled pressure for Mr Kenyatta to sign the Bill into law to end Kenyans' suffering, where the cost of living is concerned. If Parliament amends the Bill by fully accommodating the President’s reservations, the Speaker shall re-submit it to him for assent.   If Uhuru assents to the Finance Bill, the VAT will be suspended, bringing down the cost of fuel.
