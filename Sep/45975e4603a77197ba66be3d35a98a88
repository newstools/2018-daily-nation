The government has set up a standing committee to hasten the processing of title deeds for public schools after it emerged that only 2,070 out of 27,000 institutions have acquired the documents. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed said the government is making every effort to secure public interest that lies in the country’s learning institutions. “It is for this reason that the Ministry of Education, together with the Ministry of Land, are transforming the working group on school titling into a standing committee, so as to fast-track the process that began in 2016,” said Ms Mohamed during the launch of 2018 national examinations at Pangani Girls on Tuesday. The CS said the government will not relent in its quest to secure school lands. “We will ensure that the schools that were established by our forefathers and foremothers as well as many well-wishers do not fade into the sunset under our watch but remain the haloed grounds that they are through the sanctity of the title,” added Ms Mohamed. In Nairobi, a report shows many schools have no title deeds.   More than 100 primary and secondary public schools need title deeds.
