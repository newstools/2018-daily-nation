Wazito FC have officially been relegated from the SportPesa Premier League (SPL) following Chemelil Sugar’s 1-0 win over Thika United in a match played at Thika Sub county stadium on Thursday. Clifford Omondi scored the all-important goal on 37 minutes as Francis Baraza’s men held on to take their points tally to 35, seven behind 17th placed Wazito, who cannot surpass the figure should they win their remaining two games against Bandari and Sony Sugar. The result sees Chemelil remain third from bottom with a point below 15th placed Nakumatt, who have 36 points. Wazito, who gained promotion from the National Super League (NSL) last year, join Thika United who were relegated early this month. The third-placed team from the NSL will play the side that finishes 16th in the SPL in a relegation playoff at the end of the season. Wazito coach Frank Ouna, who cut a brave face after his side lost 2-1 to Kariobangi Sharks on Wednesday, expressed hope of a return to the top flight. “We now have a sponsor on board, we’ve picked our lessons from the Premier League, we know what to expect in NSL having been there but we shall be back,” said Ouna. He added: “We still have two games to play, we will fight until the end but the turning point was losing 18 players in June,” he said.   The Mombasa based side now has an unassailable 59 points.
