Police in Tigania East, Meru County are investigating the death of a woman who was killed and her head chopped off 10 days ago. The body of the 55-year-old woman was found a few metres away from her home in Antoandrew village. She went missing on September 17, 2018. MAIN SUSPECT The head of the victim was found seven days later stuffed inside her handbag and dumped in a nearby stream. Tigania East Directorate of Criminal Investigations Benson Omondi said they have arrested a Mr Peter Murungi Muthinja who is said to be the main suspect. “The investigations are at advanced stage. So far we have arrested one Mr Murungi who will be arraigned in court tomorrow, Thursday,” said Mr Omondi. Mr James Kirima whose mother was killed told the media that his son came running and told him that together with other villagers, they had seen a body of a woman without a head. DELAYED BURIAL Mr Kirima said his son identified the body because of the clothes the deceased had worn. “We reported the matter at Muthara Police Station. The body is being preserved at Miathene Sub-County Hospital mortuary,” said Mr Kirima whose hand was chopped off a few years back. The family members said they delayed the burial because the victim's head was still missing. LAND DISPUTES “We are now planning to bury our mother on Saturday,” he said. The family is accusing their uncle who is the main suspect in the murder. Mr Kirima claimed they have been having land disputes with his uncle.   The dead man was expected to join Chuka University for an engineering course.
