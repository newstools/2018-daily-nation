Police in Busia town have seized 88 bags of contraband sugar with an estimated value of Sh1.5 million. The illegal goods, which were packed in 50kg bags, are suspected to have been smuggled into Kenya from neighbouring Uganda thorough the porous border. WARAGI Busia County Commander Wambua Katithi on Sunday said 68 bags of the sweetener were found at a warehouse at Bulanda on the outskirts of Busia while 20 others were confiscated in Butula. “We have arrested one suspect in Bumala who was transporting 20 bags of sugar in a Probox to an unknown destination. In total, we have impounded 88 bags each weighing 50kgs,” Mr Katithi said. “We have impounded three Probox cars whose owners are still on the run. Other goods we have impounded include Waragi brand of illicit liquor from Uganda." He said measures they have put in place to tame smuggling at the border are bearing fruit. He said they had already identified a number of cars suspected to be involved in smuggling. “Last month alone, we lost five people in a case of hit and run and we suspect the cars used by smugglers are behind the deaths." SH1.5BN Mr Katithi warned that the war against contraband goods would continue, adding that police had already changed tact to deal with law breakers. The seizure comes a day after President Kenyatta led destruction of contraband goods valued at Sh1.5 billion at the East African Portland Cement grounds, Athi River. The goods, seized for tax evasion and failing to meet set standards, included rice, sugar, medical equipment, vehicles and building materials. He said those who import fake goods are enemies of Kenya’s industrialisation. Mr Kenyatta warned heads of parastatals and government agencies against passing the buck when faced with corruption scandals. “If your junior is corrupt, it means you are also corrupt and negligent. If you cannot fight corruption in your organisation, there are Kenyans who can take up that job,” Mr Kenyatta said.   Kebs drops the bombshell.
