Ulinzi Warriors put up a spirited fight to shatter Kenya Ports Authority’s unbeaten run in the Kenya Basketball Federation men’s Premier League at the KPA Makande hall on Sunday. This happened as KPA women beat Kenyatta University Oryx 59-41 in their top flight encounter. It was a sweet victory for Ulinzi, who last beat KPA in the 2016 play-offs. Ulinzi started the match with clear intent racing to a 22-11 run in the first quarter with Tiberius Menya combing well with red-hot Eric Mutoro, who nailed three pointers at will. Ulinzi, however, suffered a set back in the second quarter when Menya was ejected for committing two fouls, a decision that was strongly opposed by the soldiers causing a quarter hour stop to the game. When play resumed, KPA pressed their advantage to outscore Ulinzi 22-10 in the second quarter for a 33-32 half time lead. That’s probably the best the Dockers could do as the soldiers went ahead to outscore them 20-19 and 20-14 in the third and fourth quarters respectively to claim the big win. Eric Mutoro scored a game high 25 points while John Washika and Antonia Bwire scored 14 and 11 points respectively.
