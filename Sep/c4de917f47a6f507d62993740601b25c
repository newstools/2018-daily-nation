For universities — the citadels of reason, learning and professionalism — to be bogged down by long-drawn-out management disputes is a crying shame and an embarrassment to the higher education sector. Egerton and Masinde Muliro have been in the news over leadership rows that threaten their very stability and ability to discharge their core mandate — teaching and research — as the vice-chancellors fight claims of mismanagement, abuse of office and corruption. While that may not be unique, the way the universities have gone about resolving the issues raises eyebrows. They have chosen the court of public opinion with all sorts of accusations and counter-claims thrown around. RESOLVE CONFLICTS Though these are public bodies, it is prudent to resolve conflicts through the established organs — such as the university council and the senate. Whether the allegations are true or not, no one should be condemned unheard and the VCs, who are learnt, diligent and respectable individuals, should not have their reputations so soiled. Claims of tribalism, internal feuds, unethical behaviour by lecturers and examination malpractices have lately rocked the universities, both public and private. FILL POST Moi University, one of the oldest in the country, only got a substantive VC in March following a protracted attempt to fill the post for a whole year. The world over, universities operate under a clear and strict set of rules that should make them the bastions of professionalism. The council and the senate closely oversee the use of funds and the running of academic programmes. However, the leadership in our universities is increasingly being made to answer to the whims of politicians and influence peddlers. The Commission for University Education (CUE) and other regulatory bodies must step in and stop the needless bitter feuds.
