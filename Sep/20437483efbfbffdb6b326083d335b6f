Former Safari Rally star James Kahumbura is embroiled in a legal battle with a tenant he allegedly evicted from a business premise in Kawangware three months ago. Kahumbura on Wednesday appeared before a Kibera court but the case was adjourned to Friday as one of his co accused was said to be unwell. He has maintained that he had a lawful eviction order to evict Mr Evans Muriuki, but the complainant is accusing him and four others of stealing and damaging his property. What started as a dispute before the Business Premises Rent Tribunal, has seen the parties seek redress at the High Court, where Kahumbura attempted to block his prosecution at the Magistrate court. Mr Muriuki is accusing him of stealing property valued at Sh3 million. He was the proprietor of Uchumi Bar in Kawangware 46 area. He claims that Kahumbura, Shariff Obadiah Musumba, Jotham Okwayo Osochi, William Kilemia and Kedias Kezza Nduma broke into the bar and stole his property. They denied the charges before Kibera Chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani and are out on bond. Mr Muriuki has also accused Mr Kahumbura of threatening to kill him, claims the retired sportsman has vehemently denied and even moved to the High Court to block police from arresting him. A judge ordered him to appear before the police for interrogation and he complied.
