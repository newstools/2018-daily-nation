Detectives on Tuesday arrested Michael Oyamo, the personal assistant of Migori Governor Okoth Obado, in connection with the abduction of Nation journalist Barrack Oduor and a university student. Migori CID boss Benedict Kigen said Mr Oyamo was arrested in Uriri. The arrest came shortly after two media lobby groups, the Kenya Union of Journalists and the Media Council of Kenya, condemned the Monday night abduction and asked police to investigate the incident. At the same time, Mr Obado's office denied playing any part in the abduction of Homa Bay-based Oduor and Sharon Otieno, a second-year student at Rongo University. Mr Obado’s press secretary Nicholas Anyuor said linking the governor to the incident could be a political ploy meant to tarnish the name of the county boss. “Governor Obado is not aware of such a plan and his name should not be dragged into such criminal schemes. Let police do the investigations and take necessary actions,” Mr Anyuor said. Mr Oduor and Ms Otieno were abducted moments after leaving Graca Hotel in Rongo on Monday night. Mr Oduor jumped out of a speeding vehicle on the Homa Bay-Kisumu road but the whereabouts of Ms Otieno are still unknown. Speaking to the Nation, Melida Auma, Ms Otieno’s mother, broke down explaining the heartache she is going through because she cannot reach her daughter on phone. “Please don’t tell me they have killed my girl. I hope she is still alive and that she will finally reach me,” said Ms Auma, a primary school teacher in Homa Bay. She added that her 26-year-old daughter is pregnant. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations in Nyanza said Tuesday that the search for the student was underway. Nyanza CID boss Michael Baraza said police will fast-track their investigations.
