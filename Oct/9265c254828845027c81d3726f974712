President Uhuru Kenyatta has said KDF soldiers will only pull out of Somalia after terror group Al-Shabaab is defeated and stability restored. Mr Kenyatta on Sunday said the Kenya Defence Forces will maintain their presence in the war-ravaged country under the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) until all terror networks are crushed. "We went to Somalia in 2011. We shall continue our presence in the country until the restoration of full security in Somalia," he said during the 7th annual KDF Day at Kenyatta Barracks in Gilgil, Nakuru County. KDF Day is marked to commemorate soldiers who died while on official duty. He said the country appreciates the commitment of the soldiers in promoting peace initiatives. "Kenyans are proud of the way their soldiers have handled themselves - in a professional, patriotic and disciplined manner." FOOD SECURITY Mr Kenyatta further urged the military to continue cooperating with other security agencies in times of disasters and emergencies. During the ceremony, the widows were presented with mementos and certificates of appreciation. As a way of promoting food production, Mr Kenyatta opened a Sh3.8 billion agro-processing factory within the barracks under the Kenya Ordnance Factories Corporation. Farmers in Nakuru, Nyandarua, Narok, Elgeyo Marakwet and Nyeri counties who plant cabbages, carrots, kales and potatoes will benefit. "I am happy to note that the KDF is actively supporting the Big 4 vision. This initiative by KDF addresses the pillars on food security and manufacturing," he said. Those in attendance were Cabinet Secretaries Raychelle Omamo (Defence), Monica Juma (Foreign Affairs), Chief of Defence Forces Samson Mwathethe, governors Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru) and Francis Kimemia (Nyandarua).
