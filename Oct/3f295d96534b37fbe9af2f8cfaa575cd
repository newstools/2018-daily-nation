Several journalists have on Wednesday been attacked and ejected from covering Nyandarua County Assembly leadership row as MCAs bar Speaker Wahome Ndegwa from chambers. The assembly's security officers allegedly rained blows, slapped and clobbered the journalists, claiming they were under instructions from the embattled Speaker who has been barred from entering the chambers. Royal Media Services reporter Patris Simbili sustained injuries on his head during the incident. The first victim was Radio Africa Group reporter Ndichu Wainaina whose press card was confiscated at the assembly's gates. Kameme FM reporter Jimmy Muguo and Sauti ya Mwananchi journalist Jathan Kamau have also been attacked. TUESDAY CHAOS On Tuesday, chaos erupted at the assembly forcing the Speaker to adjourn the session. The ward reps are plotting to oust Mr Ndegwa, accusing him of failure to recognise new House leaders. Those opposed to the new leadership have extended their frustrations to the media, accusing journalists of filing stories without consulting them. “You must understand that I am the local party boss. I was born in this county. You are a stranger in Nyandarua, and I am going to use all means to ensure you are moved from here, Don’t joke with me,” said the local Jubilee Party boss, Mr Peter Machithi, in threat to the Nation reporter based in Nyandarua. During the interview, a section of the MCAs called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve the House and the county government to allow fresh elections.
