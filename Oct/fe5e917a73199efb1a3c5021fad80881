Hi Brenda, My house help spends her afternoons taking selfies. I donâ€™t have an issue with that as the baby is in school and that is her free time but recently , she uploaded a new WhatsApp photo which made me feel I should be concerned. She took a photo without a trouser and posted a sexy selfie of herself. We never discussed social media rules because I never thought I had to but this latest photo had me a little worried about what else she is exposing herself to. There are predators online. I am concerned for her and ultimately for my child. How do I deal with this without her feeling muffled?  Hi, Do you have a contact with your help? If not, then perhaps it is time to do so. Obviously her actions may affect your child, seeing as yes, there are predators out there. I have questions about what the point of the selfie was, but outside of a professional context, you cannot dictate what someone can and cannot do with her WhatsApp profile photo. It's like how, when a company is hiring, they should not be looking at your Facebook profile, but they still do. Unless it's in ink, you don't have the power to do or say anything. So, get some ink. Whichever way you propose it, she'll be offended, so be as kind as you can. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
