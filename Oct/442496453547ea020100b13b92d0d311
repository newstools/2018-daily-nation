The crowning for the sixth time in a row of Maasai Mara Game Reserve as the best destination in Africa cements a legacy Kenya should cherish. The recognition of the Mara in the World Travel Awards — edging out competition from South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda — is, indeed, another reminder that we have a gem in our midst that we may not be giving the attention it deserves. This honour is the best advertising and promotion that our tourism industry would ever have. That the panel has consistently picked the Mara since 2013 means that there is something valuable here. This award is significant, coming not so long after last year’s acrimonious elections that sparked fears of bloodletting similar to the post-2007 election violence. However, this is not the time to rest on our laurels. There is a lot of work to be done to ensure that our tourist destinations continue to receive visitors. TERRIBLE STATE One of the biggest challenges is, of course, insecurity. The travel industry is very sensitive as people will hardly travel to places where their lives will be endangered. The threat of terrorism hovering over the region is a source of concern. Secondly, there is a need to develop infrastructure. The Mara has decent hotels and lodges but the roads leading there are in a terrible state. The good news, however, is that they are now being fixed. However, the tourism industry should be alarmed at the reports that the annual wildebeest migration, which attracts many visitors, is now threatened with the Mara River waters declining. The thrill of the animals swimming across the river is a great spectacle and tourist attraction that has earned a place among the Eight Wonders of the World. Conservation must be stepped up to ensure that the river fills up again lest we lose this treasure.
