The trial of Jane Muthoni, who is accused of killing her husband Solomon Mwangi, was adjourned after she said she was unwell. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP), though its Twitter handle on Friday, said Justice Joel Ngugi ordered Ms Muthoni be taken to hospital. "Justice Joel Ngugi directed that a medical report be presented in court before the case is mentioned on October 25." The ODPP further said that the prosecution had opposed the adjournment, arguing that it was a delay tactic. "The prosecution had opposed application for adjournment citing such numerous applications by the accused aimed at obstructing and stalling the case. The prosecution was ready today with two witnesses and has five more to present before case closes." The former Icaciri Girls Secondary School headteacher is suspected of orchestrating the murder of her husband, who was the principal of Kiru High School, in 2016. Mr Mwangi's body was found dumped in a thicket in Kiambu County after he went missing.   Accused says her children are out of school for lack of fees.
