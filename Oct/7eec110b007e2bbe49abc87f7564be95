Over 6,000 athletes have confirmed participation in the 10th edition of Isaiah Kiplagat Foundation Ndalat Gaa Cross Country to be held in Nandi County on Saturday. The 2018 edition of the race will see at least 30 pupils and students benefit from a mentorship programme under the Isaiah Kiplagat Foundation. According to the organisers, the mentorship programme will go a long way in shaping the future of the young athletes so that they can become responsible citizens in future. It will involve training in areas around personal awareness, personality development and emotional intelligence. The race is synonymous with being a launch pad for young athletes. Some of these include 10,000m world bronze medallist Agnes Tirop, 3,000m steeplechase World and Olympic champion Conseslus Kipruto and former London Marathon champion Prisca Jeptoo. Speaking during an inspection tour of the venue at Ndalat Gaa Girls High School, Athletics Kenya Central Rift chairman Abraham Mutai said they were set for the race. “As you can see, everything is in place ready and we expect competition to be high given the star studded list of entries," he said. The race will be graced by world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge, who is the race’s ambassador. Noah Kipkorir and Sandrafelis Chebet will be out to defend their senior race titles while World under-20 10,000m champion Rhonex Kipruto is expected to star in men’s junior race with stiff competition expected from World Under-20 champion in 5,000m Edward Zakayo. "The race will be competitive and everyone wants to win but I'm ready to tackle the field after my good training," said Londiani-based Chebet.   Over 3,000 athletes expected for the event.
