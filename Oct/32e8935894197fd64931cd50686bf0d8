Police have on Tuesday arrested a head teacher who allegedly showed up drunk to collect Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examinations in Nyandarua County. The teacher, Mr Peter Kamau Ndegwa who head private primary school, caused a stir when he staggered to the collection centre at the Nyandarua County Commissioner's office demanding to be served first. "You need to know people. I am the manager of the learning institution I work for. Stop joking with me," the teacher is said to have shouted as he headed to the exams distribution centre. Nyandarua Central Deputy County Commissioner Gideon Oyagi who confirmed the arrest said the teacher has been replaced. "We have directed the police to arraign him, that's a professional misconduct," said Mr Oyagi.   Some candidates failed to sit the exam because they were not registered.
