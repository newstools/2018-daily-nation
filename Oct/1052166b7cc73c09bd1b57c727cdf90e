A total of 30 schools across the country are under investigation for collecting money from parents in order to aid cheating in the national examinations set for next month. Kenya National examinations Council (Knec) Chairman George Magoha on Monday disclosed that three of the schools that are involved in the practice are in Garissa, four in Kisii and five in Meru. “We are closely monitoring those schools and we want to ask them stop such plans immediately,” said Prof Magoha. He was addressing journalists at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) after attending a meeting with regional education officials and school principals. VISITED SCHOOLS He said he had visited schools in Migori, Homa Bay, Nyamira and Kisii while Knec acting chief executive officer Mercy Karogo had visited central Kenya in an examination pre-monitoring exercise. Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang will Tuesday visit Nyeri and Isiolo counties while other Knec officers will visit other regions. Dr Kipsang urged school heads not to be tempted into cheating, saying the penalty for it will be severe. “We are determined to deliver credible examinations the way we have done in the last two years,” said Dr Kipsang. The Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association assured Kenyans that it will support the move to maintain high levels of exams integrity.
