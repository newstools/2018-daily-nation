Hi Brenda, Thank for your good work. I am over 30 but I can’t seem to settle down. I keep falling in and out of love frequently, dating many people and dumping them for flimsy reasons. I don’t want to keep hurting people. Is there a problem with me? How can I stop this and just settle or at least stop hurting others?  Hi, Are you sure you even want to settle down, or are you telling yourself that you should be settling down? If you know you're dumping them for flimsy reasons, then you are clearly self-sabotaging. Either you want to be in a relationship or you don't – and your heart clearly doesn't. Perhaps figure out why you have an issue with actual commitment, because until you do, you will just continue to hurt people around you who will in turn hurt the next person they come in contact with. Falling in love is easy – staying in love is the hard part. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I have remedied that sentence, thanks for pointing it out.
