Kenya Simbas leaves the country on Wednesday for the Rugby World Cup qualifying Repechage tournament scheduled for November 11-23 in Marseille, France. The Simbas will make a stopover in Romania where they will play the hosts on November 3 in an international friendly before heading to Marseille where they will meet Canada, Hong Kong and Germany. The winner of the round robin competition will secure a ticket to compete against New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and Namibia in Pool “B” of the Rugby World Cup next year in Japan. UNPAID ALLOWANCES The team’s preparations has not been easy with the players going on strike owing to unpaid allowances and salaries. The players only resumed training a few days ago after Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) was forced to source for money to pay them. The Union has been struggling to get sponsorship, making it difficult to fund the Simbas programmes. What has made it worse is the Sports ministry has given them a cold shoulder since March. KRU has contracted 40 players for the months of September, October and November purposely for the World Cup qualifier where each player is entitled to Sh40,000 a month. SH60 MILLION KRU had presented a budget of Sh60 million to the Government for the Repechage qualifier two months ago, which was later scaled down to Sh36 million, but nothing has been forthcoming. All national teams need to be treated equally by the government since they all represent the country. At the same time, KRU has to put in place a strong marketing team to source for funds instead of relying on the government for sustenance. National outings should be a shared responsibility between the government and sports federations. Kenya is a heartbeat away from qualifying for the World Cup but the Government does not seem to care. At this time, the team needs to have settled down devoid of sideshows that could harm their chances. It is not right for the team to have only one build-up match before the qualifier.
