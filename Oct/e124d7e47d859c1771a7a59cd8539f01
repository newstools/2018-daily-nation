A young girl has described Deputy President William Kenyatta as a good ‘Sunday school teacher’. In her poem, Esther Mwangi said that the DP had cleared the air over whether there were crocodiles in River Jordan. “Uncle Willy you are a good Sunday school teacher because now I know River Jordan did not have crocodiles. Yaani safari ya Canan haikuwa na mamba,” recited the girl. Mr Ruto was the chief guest during a ceremony to consecrate regional Bishops and scores of other clergymen of the Pentecostal Evangelistic fellowship of Africa (PEFA) in Karatina on Sunday. Dressed in a white and blue dress, the girl left the guests and other faithful in stitches. CHURCH SERVICE She also invited the Deputy President to a Sunday service at her Church in Nyeri town. In his speech, the DP said that he would honour the girl’s invitation. Mr Ruto asked leaders to be careful with their utterances. The DP said that from the girl’s poem, it was clear that children pay attention to what politicians say. “It is important that when we speak as leaders we should know children are also listening, we should always speak the truth so that we don’t mislead them” he said as he promised to visit the girl. Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who has often justified the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Building Bridges Initiative with tale that his trip to the Biblical Canaan had briefly been halted by crocodiles on the banks of River Jordan. CROCODILES During Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kakamega, the Deputy President made fun of Mr Odinga’s analogy insisting that during Sunday school they were not told of any crocodile infestation. The girl was invited to the podium by PEFA Kenya country presiding Bishop Josphat Moffat Kiliomba.
