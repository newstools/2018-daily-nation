Armed bandits abducted a woman and her two children on Tuesday in Tharaka North, officials say. Kathangacini chief, Kibuti Ndango said the bandits later set free the woman and one of the children and took off with her teenage daughter. Mr Ndango said the assailants attacked Nkiruni village around 1pm and stole 22 cows, 47 goats, two sheep, and a donkey and vanished into the neighbouring Meru National Park. He said police and warden officers are pursuing the attackers inside the park. Gatunga Ward Rep Mutegi Ruujia said the attackers sacrificed a goat and spread blood on the bank of River Ura after crossing it, signifying successful raid. Mr Julius Njeru Kathenya whose wife and children were abducted said he hoped that her daughter who was still at the hands of the bandits would be found safe and the animals recovered by the police. The region has been experiencing frequent attacks by heavily armed bandits who in the course kill and injure people. Mr Ruujia has called on government to beef up security in the region and deploy ant-stock theft police officers in Nkiruni camp that has remained without officers for a long time even after completion of its construction. “For many years our people have been killed and livestock stolen and government has made little effort to end the menace,” he said.
