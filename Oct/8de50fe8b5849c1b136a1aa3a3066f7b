The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has directed the Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet to conduct an investigation into the deadly bus crash in Fort Ternan, Kericho County that claimed 58 lives. The investigation, Mr Haji said, should cover “all government agencies charged with the responsibility of ensuring safety on our roads as well as the owners of the subject motor vehicle”. “In exercise of the powers conferred upon me, I direct that you cause investigation into the matter to determine the persons who may have, through acts of commission or omission, contributed either directly or indirectly into the occurrence of the accident,” Mr Haji said in a statement Thursday evening. The public prosecutor ordered the file be forwarded to him immediately after investigations for what he said will be “appropriate directions.” The 67-seater bus, belonging to Western Express Sacco, is said to have veered off the road while descending a steep slope. The bus then hit a guard rail, rolled and plunged down about 20 metres, where it landed on a rocky farm. By Thursday evening, death toll of those who perished in the crash climbed to 58, 32 men, 17 women and 9 children.   56 people were killed, 16 injured in horror dawn crash in Kericho.
