Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board (KMLLTB) is targeting 10 institutions for closure for admitting students who do not meet the minimum qualifications. KMLLTB which regulates business practices in medical laboratories says over 3,000 students who do not qualify for diploma have been admitted to the institutions. Senior Lab Auditor of the Board, John Nyamuni said that the institutions either admit students who do not meet the minimum requirement, lack adequate human resource f or have inadequate physical infrastructure. He added that the institutions not recognised by the Ministry of Health and Technical and Vocational Education and Training Authority will be stopped from further training. Mr Nyamuni said managers of institutions that have been training illegally have been arrested and arraigned in court. “Regional Institute of Business Management in Nairobi, Kitengela and Migori Campuses, Kings Medical College in Nyeri, Meru Institute of Medical and Social Studies in Meru and Vihomi College in Kisumu are the colleges whose managers were arrested,” he said. He said Sang’alo Technical Institute, Kisiwa Technical institute in Bungoma County had their students transferred due to lack of requisite standards. Mr Nyamuni said that inspection of the Kenya School of Medical Sciences and Technology in Thika, all Kenya Institute of Professional Studies campuses and Royal college in Ruiru revealed that they admitted some students who did not qualify to take the course. “The rules specify the required grades needed to be admitted for the lab technicians course yet these training facilities fail to comply. They waste time and money for these students,” he said. Diploma trainees in medical laboratory sciences are required to have a KCSE mean grade of C.
