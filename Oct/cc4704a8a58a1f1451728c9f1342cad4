Complaints by parliamentary staff about being mistreated by the MPs they work for have the ring of truth around them. Indeed, the worst-kept secret is that many constituencies are poorly managed with the MPs obsessed with only rewarding their close allies, aides and relatives. As a result, the professional workers end up getting needlessly frustrated. There are, of course, a few exceptional cases where MPs and their staff run efficient outfits. And these have often been recognised with awards for efficiency in the delivery of services. But the majority are in a mess. That’s not surprising, since the MPs’ core business of politics is not always accompanied by good managerial skills. REGULATIONS It is encouraging, therefore, to hear from the Clerk of the National Assembly, Mr Michael Sialai, that his office has received complaints about long working hours and late payment of salaries. Such treatment of staff is the easiest way to demotivate them and the constituencies will not only not get value from the workers but the MPs will also suffer the backlash from poor services. Parliamentary staff play a key role in executing administrative and other tasks to enable the lawmakers to concentrate on their principal duty. It is in the MPs’ interest to ensure that they have competent and experienced constituency managers to properly plan for the implementation of projects and programmes. Clerk Sialai has advised the parliamentary staff to take their grievances to the constituency liaison officer for redress. This is commendable, but it does not go far enough to solve the problem. And he has pointed out that there are clear constituency regulations on how to deal with cases of staff indiscipline. What is required is a win-win situation, where staff issues are streamlined so that constituency operations are enhanced for the people’s benefit.
