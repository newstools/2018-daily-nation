Hundreds of villagers descended on the suspect’s homestead at Kaminjeiwet village in Chesoen Location on Sunday and torched 13 houses including those of his parents and brothers. They then proceeded to the neighbouring Tebeswet village and brought town a house belonging to a family member before moving to Kiptergekiat village on the border of Sotik and Bomet central sub counties where they torched two other houses belonging to another member of the suspect’s family. SUCCUMBED TO INJURIES Police officers led by Bomet Officer Commanding Police Station Daniel Nyagako and other local administrators, arrived at the homestead only to find the houses on fire. "The victim was stabbed at around 6pm on Saturday and was rushed to Tenwek Mission Hospital where he succumbed to the injuries," said Kipleji Assistant Chief Elisha Langat. Mr Langat confirmed that the suspect’s family was notorious for selling illicit brews. SERVING JAIL TERM "Recently, a family member was arrested during a raid and was fined Sh70,000 which she was unable to pay and is still serving a jail term," said Mr Langat.

Villagers accused policemen from the area of receiving bribes to protect illicit brew sellers in the region.
