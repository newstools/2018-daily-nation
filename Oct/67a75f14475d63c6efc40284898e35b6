The latest flare-up of inter-clan clashes in Marsabit County, in which 14 people have been killed, is a grim reminder of the endemic violence in the northern region. The fighting broke out just when the national examinations were about to begin. The closure of 10 schools, though regrettable, is a means to avert more casualties. Quite laudable, however, are the efforts by the authorities to quell the violence. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i certainly has his hands full, considering the numerous hotspots and volatile regions around the country. The fighting in Marsabit comes not so long after clashes in Mau and Njoro, in the Rift Valley, in which several people were killed and property destroyed. CRACKDOWN In Marsabit, security personnel have moved with commendable speed, zeroing in on suspected inciters of the violence. And the authorities are not mincing their words in laying the blame for the deadly clashes on politicians. The arrest of two MPs for questioning over the violence should send a strong signal to the communities involved that no one will be spared in the crackdown. The Interior ministry has warned that more leaders could be arrested as the investigation into claims that local politicians are arming their communities to attack their neighbours continue. This new bloody episode trashes the Boma Peace Agreement of 2014, where the leaders pledged to maintain peace and called for stern action against those who fail to comply. It is imperative that rival politicians learn to shun warlike activities and seek reconciliation. Where there are differences over boundaries or the sharing of resources, these should be resolved through dialogue. It’s a big shame that in the 21st century, some leaders opt to solve their differences through violence. Punishing errant leaders will deter others from committing crimes.
