The Embu County Government has completed constructing and equipping Embu Level Five Hospital's cancer wing. Health executive Jamleck Muturi said seven medics from the hospital are undergoing training in Mombasa before they start administering chemotherapy. Mr Muturi said the facility will ease the burden of patients who had to travel to other regions to seek treatment. He also said the county received drugs from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. "Patients have been going to hospitals and being frustrated due to lack of drugs. We have now purchased the drugs and they will be distributed immediately," he said on Tuesday last week. The regional administration also organised a free medical camp where about 2,000 residents received services.
