Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has invited Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) for second round of talks as it moves to cool tension ahead of the national examination in coming weeks. The meeting between the parties will be held next week on Friday (October 19) in Nairobi following the collapse of talks in Naivasha last week. “As you are aware, upon adjournment of the Knut/TSC retreat in Naivasha on October 3, parties mutually agreed to meet later to deliberate on pending issues,” reads a letter to Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion by TSC chief executive, Mrs Nancy Macharia dated October 9. Mrs Macharia said the meeting will start at 10am. The latest development is a major shift in hardline positions that had been taken by Knut and TSC and which had created tension in the sector as they both blamed each other for the collapse of the talks. Knut has also threatened to call a strike starting October 17 in order to force talks with TSC. The meeting collapsed after TSC rejected a demand to revoke the transfers of 85 head teachers holding union positions.   TSC said it needs more time to look into the issues raised.
