A househelp who allegedly killed her employer together with her child in Muhoroni in Kisumu County has been charged with murder. Ms Jackline Auma on Wednesday appeared before High Court Judge Fred Ochien'g, where she pleaded not guilty to the murder of Mrs Elizabeth Achien'g and her three-month old son in June, this year. MENTAL ASSESSMENT The house help took a plea after she underwent a mental assessment and was found fit for trial. Mrs Auma, a Ugandan national, is said to have stabbed the 26-year-old woman and her baby before fleeing the country. She was arrested in Uganda and brought back to the country to face trial. The accused was denied bail after the judge insisted that she is a flight risk. HISTORY OF FLEEING “You have a history of fleeing the country and that is a compelling reason not to be given bond,” said the judge. Ms Achieng's body had several knife wounds on the chest and burns on the left side of her body which her husband, Evans Otieno, said was inflicted by a hot iron box that was found beside her body. The accused had lived with the family for only one month and did not present any identification card to her employer. The case will be heard from November 6, 2018.
