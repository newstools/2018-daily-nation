Several county assemblies have been hit by violence, putting to shame their claim to democratic credentials and leaving the members in utter disgrace. MCAs in Nyandarua, Kisumu and Homa Bay have resorted to violence while trying to resolve issues such as House leadership, Bills and debate priorities. Several other county assemblies have also had their share of the ignominy since devolution came into effect about five years ago. Their actions have been crude, and relentless, and have, in some instances, resulted in serious injuries to some of the combatants. That elected leaders can choose to resolve their differences by attacking one another physically is a shameful indicator of just how low and dishonourable they have become. RESPECTABLE CHAMBERS County assemblies are supposed to be respectable chambers, where reasoned debate, brainstorming and intelligent conversations take place. They should be the citadels of honour, dignity and methodical legislation, attracting only respect and admiration from the electorate, especially youth. But the MCAs have turned them into centres of insults and chaos inviting only contempt and shock. It could, perhaps, be understandable if the chaos was driven by charged debates on grave and sensitive matters touching on the lives of the voters. SETTLED AMICABLY The fact that it is sparked by simple issues that can be settled amicably and quickly is regrettable and embarrassing. It raises deep questions about the calibre, dignity and education standard of the MCAs. It might seem like a far-fetched thought, but it might not be long before the precincts of the assemblies degenerate into chambers of death. This is why the law enforcement agencies must move in to control the situation. Those involved in disturbing the public peace, violence and assault must be arrested, tried and, if found guilty, jailed and blocked from ever holding public office.
