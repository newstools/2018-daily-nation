BOMBING SPREE Thirteen improved explosive devices were sent to different individuals in the mail bombing spree, including PVC pipe, a small clock, a battery and wiring, Wray said.He said it was "too early" to publicly identify a motive for the bombing spree, while also warning there "may be" further packages. "It's too early at this stage for us to be discussing motivation in this particular case," Wray said. "We're concerned about people committing acts of violence under any motivation." PROMINENT PEOPLE According to pictures posted on social media and broadcast by US television, a van impounded in Florida in connection with the suspect, Cesar Sayoc, was covered in stickers denouncing Democrats and supportive of Donald Trump.
