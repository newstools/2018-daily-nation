A student at Lugusi Boys Secondary School in Kakamega County stabbed his colleague to death in a vicious attack which disrupted learning at the school on Wednesday. The two students had engaged in an argument which ended in a nasty scuffle in class before they were asked to go the staff room by a teacher to face disciplinary action. The attacker is reported to have sneaked to the staff room armed with a knife and lunged at his colleague inflicting a deep cut on the left shoulder. Teachers who rushed to the staff room after they heard screams found the injured student sprawled on the floor and bleeding profusely. There were no teachers in the room when the Form Two student attacked his colleague. The attacker was handed over to police in Malava and the murder weapon recovered at the scene. The student succumbed to his injuries as teachers were administering first aid and making arrangements to rush him to the nearest hospital, Malava Sub-County Hospital which is located 10 kilometres away. A sombre mood engulfed the school after principal Charles Kokonya announced the death of the student. He described the students as hardworking and a talented rugby player. He said teachers had decided to appoint him as the entertainment prefect because of his good conduct and leadership skills. “What has happened is quite unusual and unfortunate. This is what happens when we are unable to manage our anger,” said Mr Kokonya who was accompanied by Kakamega North Sub-County Education Director Anne Shiundu. He said students in Form One to Three would be allowed to travel home until Monday as the incident is investigated.
