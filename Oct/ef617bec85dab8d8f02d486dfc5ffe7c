IN LONDON Kenya captain Victor Wanyama’s return to first team action for Tottenham last week puts him in a good position to start the club’s crucial Champions League game at home to Barcelona Wednesday night. Wanyama made his first start of the season in Tottenham’s Carabou (League) Cup victory over premiership rivals Watford on Wednesday although he was substituted late on. He also played a full second half on Saturday. The Sh1.57 billion midfielder suffered a recurrence of his knee injury earlier this season which prevented him being available for the Premier League until late September but he will now be anxious to be included in the squad for this week’s vital game. Tottenham lost their first Champions League match to Inter Milan 2-1 despite being ahead until the 85th minute and they would love Wanyama to be on fire again on Wednesday and reproduce the form he showed the last time he played the Spanish champions. That was when he was playing for Scottish Champions Celtic in 2013, when he scored in a famous 2-1 victory at Celtic Park. Wanyama’s chances of playing have increased due to a number of first team injuries at Spurs including to England player Dele Alli, Belgian internationals Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele and Denmark’s Christian Eriksen. Tottenham have had an erratic season so far with 3 wins in a row (including a 3-0 away win at Manchester United) followed by three losses including against table topping Liverpool. However they got back to winning ways with a 2-1 win away to Brighton and followed that with a 2-0 win at Huddersfield on Saturday to put them into fourth place.   Messi has already scored eight times this season.
