Konoin MP Brighton Yegon has been charged with assault. The MP is accused of assaulting Mr Nicholas Kipsang Ngetich on October 14 in Kapset, Kimulot location, Konoin. Mr Ngetich, who was present in court, sustained actual bodily harm following the alleged attack by the legislator. RECONCILIATION Mr Robert Asembo, the MP’s lawyer, informed the court that reconciliation efforts between the accused and the victim had been initiated and were in advanced stages. “I wish to inform the court that we are in full compliance with the orders to appear before it today and we pray that the accused be released on affordable cash bail,” said Mr Asembo. The MP had been directed to appear in court on Friday morning following an application by Mr Felix Mutua, the Konoin sub-county criminal investigations officer, who claimed he had defied summons to record a statement. The MP, however, recorded the statement on October 20 at Konoin police station. Principal Magistrate Benard Omwansa said the law cannot be applied selectively as each citizen is equal.  “I have considered the application by the prosecution and the affidavit sworn by the Directorate of Criminal Investigation, and the allegation leveled against the accused person. It must be noted that all citizens are equal before the law,” he said. RELEASED The magistrate ordered the MP to be released on Sh30,000 bond or a Sh15,000 cash bail. The hearing was set for February 4, next year while the mention will be on November 13. The Jubilee MP walked into the courtroom with his supporters at 10:30am. A police officer escorted the MP to the prisoners’ holding area after the ruling was made, where he was held for 30 minutes as his lawyer paid the cash bail and processed the release documents. After securing his release, Mr Yegon was mobbed by his supporters outside the courtroom before being driven off.
