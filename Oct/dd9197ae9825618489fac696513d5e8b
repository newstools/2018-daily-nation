The National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) has joined the push for a referendumÂ aimed at overhauling the structure of government. During a one day tour of Turkana County to witness the unveiling of the NCCK branch chairman, General Secretary Canon Peter Karanja said that for a long time NCCK has been in support of the referendum. INCLUSIVITY In a press statement after the ceremony at the Bethany Hall Catholic Diocese of Lodwar, Canon Karanja said among the recommendations they have so far made is the expansion of the Executive and reducing the number of elected and nominated leaders. He says NCCK is of the view that the Executive should accommodate the position of the Prime minister and two deputies then reduce the number of the Cabinet Secretaries for the purposes of inclusivity. Canon Karanja further added that Kenyans are over represented by many leaders. He said there is need to reduce the numbers to see a resultant reduction in the wage bill that is already hurting most Kenyans. According the Canon Karanja the debate on referendum is healthy and it calls for public participation.   Odinga said there were issues in the country that could only be fixed through legal reforms.
