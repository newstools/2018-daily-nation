Police in Ruiru are holding two security guards following an attempted robbery at the Cooperative Bank in Githurai on Sunday night. The two, 32-year-old Richard Amboya and 30-year-old John Mukanya, work for a local security firm and were on duty when the incident occurred. Confirming the incident, Ruiru police boss James Ng'etich told Nation that the robbery attempt was foiled after a member of the public noticed the activities on the wall and informed the branch manager. "The unknown suspects were in the process of drilling a hole on the wall of the bank's building when someone noticed the activities on the wall and alerted the manager who then called in the police," said Ng'etich. The police commander said nothing was stolen from the bank and that investigations into the incident are ongoing. Police suspect the drilling must have started on Saturday night. A crowbar, chisel and pliers were recovered at the scene.   Titus Murakaru Githui blames Kenyans for accepting and entrenching corruption and impunity.
