A win in Sunday's National Super League (NSL) fixture against Talanta at Camp Toyoyo grounds is all Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) need to return to the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) after three years in the second tier. Victory for the bankers, who beat Coast Stima 2-0 in midweek, will see them open an unassailable lead of five points between them and third-placed Nairobi Stima with a game to spare. Nairobi Stima, third on the standings with 67 points, host stubborn Kenya Police at Karuturi grounds in Naivasha and only a win will revive their promotion hopes after dropping points in a 1-1 draw against leaders Western Stima on Wednesday. The Ibrahim Shikanda-coached Stima play KCB in the final match on October 13 but the bankers have promised to wrap up business against Talanta. “We’ve prepared well for the match with a clean bill of health in camp,” KCB caretaker coach Elvis Ayany told Nation Sport. He added: “We want to seal it although we know it will be tough, the best is to wait for 90 minutes.” Talanta top scorer Rodgers Omondi has not spared his former employers and says he wants to continue banging in goals. Talanta’s 1-0 win over the bankers in May is the only positive record between the two teams in five matches so far. “We are going to play according to the coach’s strategy. As a striker of course your job is to score goals,” said Omondi who has netted eight goals for the Abdallah Juma-led side. It will be interesting to see how Juma lines up against his former employers with who he won the KPL coach of the year award in 2013 after guiding them to a historic fourth position. Elsewhere, focus will be on the relegation battle between Nakuru AllStars and Golden Field Evangelism (GFE) who play Ushuru and Kangemi AllStars respectively. Both teams, level on a paltry 21 points, need to avoid defeat to have chances of surviving should they win their final matches next weekend.
