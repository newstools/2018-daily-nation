Migori Governor Okoth Obado will remain in police custody until October 24 when the High Court will give a ruling on his bail application. The governor, his personal assistant Michael Juma Oyamo and Migori County assembly clerk Casper Obiero were charged with the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno and her unborn child in early September. Earlier this week, the High Court in Nairobi allowed state prosecutors to merge the suspects’ murder cases. Mr Obado has been in police custody for three weeks now. Already, the governor’s stay at Industrial Area Prison Remand has been characterised by illness, which has seen him admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya and Ms Otieno’s mother have filed an application seeking to have the suspects detained until the trial is completed.   He was remanded at Industrial Area Prison after being denied bail by Judge Jessie Lesiit.
