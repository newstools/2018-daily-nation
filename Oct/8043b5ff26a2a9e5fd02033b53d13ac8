Nearly eight years since Kenya Defence Forces crossed into Somalia in pursuit of Al-Shabaab terrorists, President Uhuru Kenyatta has made it clear that the troops are not coming back home soon. This is a clear indication that the objectives of the military campaign in the war-torn neighbouring country have not yet been achieved. Indeed, the stabilisation of the internationally recognised government in Mogadishu remains a big challenge. The consequence is the spillover of insecurity across the border. In the recent past, there have been numerous terrorist attacks in the northeastern region of Kenya. Mandera, Wajir and Garissa counties are still under threat from bands of terrorists. STABILITY EFFORTS The KDF’s presence in Somalia is an effective strategy to engage the enemy on their own territory. It’s an effective way to keep them at bay. It is also instructive that KDF is operating under the auspices of the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom). This has the support of the United Nations, and its sole mission is to help to restore a government in the lawless country. As an AU and UN member, Kenya has an obligation to support regional peace and stability efforts. Kenya, which shares a long, largely porous border with Somalia, is bound to directly suffer the impact of the jihadist activities. Since the threat that sparked KDF’s entry into Somalia exists, it would be foolhardy to abandon the mission midstream. That would only embolden the enemy. It is a dangerous but crucial campaign with huge casualties in terms of the KDF soldiers killed in Somalia and increasing attacks on Kenyan territory. This is what has prompted calls for KDF’s withdrawal. But as the President stated, this is not an option now. We must carry on with the mission to liquidate Al-Shabaab.
