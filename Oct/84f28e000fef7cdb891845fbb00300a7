Kenya Police boxing team risks a ban from all boxing activities following the team’s failure to hand over to Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) the National Boxing League trophy they were wrongfully awarded last year. Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) Governing Council had given Kenya Police 14 days to return the trophy to the federation’s offices for it to be handed over to KDF who were the rightful winners. Kenya Police, popularly known as ‘Chafua Chafua’, failed to turn up for the third and final leg of the National Boxing League at Uwanja wa Mbuzi in Mombasa. BAK chairman John Kameta on Monday said the federation had asked Police to return the trophy last year after they were declared winners through a scoring system which had been tampered with to deny KDF victory. The matter was discussed during BAK’s Governing Council meeting on September 26. The meeting resolved that Kenya Police be asked to return the trophy. Kenya Police’s acting secretary general, David Munuve, was also banned for 10 years after investigations revealed that he had tampered with the system to give Kenya Police boxer Morris Ochieng victory over Dennis Muthama of Nairobi, enabling Kenya Police to get extra points that enabled them to beat KDF by a point. Police scored 121 points against KDF’s 120.
