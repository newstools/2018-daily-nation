Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu-K) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli wants the Constitution revised so that inclusivity may be fostered. Mr Atwoli said inclusivity will promote peace, which will in turn improve the confidence of investors. "We will change the Constitution so that we have peace in the country. We do not want this Constitution where whoever wins takes it all. We want inclusivity," he said during a fundraiser in aid of St Christopher Catholic Church in Kyumbi, Machakos, on Sunday. He said people opposed to the referendum quest are not committed to the reconciliation process initiated by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga on March 9. Further, he said misappropriation of public funds must also be checked to promote growth. CORRUPTION He cited the presence of several commissions with overlapping duties, an issue he said must be tackled. Other leaders who are endorsing the law review are Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, among others. "I agree with majority of Kenyans that time is ripe to change the Constitution. Let us not ask whether we need to change the Constitution, but rather what we need to change in the Constitution," Mr Wamalwa said. He observed that the cycle of violence after every election will be tackled by reviewing the law. Mr Malala said: "The problem with Kenya is not the number of members of Parliament. We may have fewer MPs who may loot the country if they lack integrity."   Handshakes have a history of realigning the political scenario in Kenya in the past.
