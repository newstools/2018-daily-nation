Former National Olympic Committee of Kenya official Stephen Soi was on Friday night arrested in connection with the Rio 2016 Olympics financial scandal. Police source told Nation that Mr Soi is being held at Muthaiga Police Station. In the recent past, detectives have been seeking to establish whether there is evidence that officials either misused or stole money allocated to the Kenyan team to Brazil in 2016, resulting in one of the most scandalous international outings in Kenya’s athletics industry. In 2016, Mr Soi, the man who led Team Kenya to Rio Olympics, admitted that he carried Sh25 million in cash to the games for accommodation and medicines A tribunal found that top officials in the Sports ministry had embezzled Sh88 million meant for air tickets to the games and recommended the prosecution of those found culpable. TICKETS The Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games Probe Committee discovered that the ministry had signed a ticketing deal with a local travel agency to provide air tickets at a much higher price than the national carrier, Kenya Airways, had quoted.
