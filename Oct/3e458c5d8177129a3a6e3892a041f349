Football Kenya Federation (FKF) delegates have approved a Sh1.2 billion budget for next year. Of the Sh1,241,993,000, Fédération Internationale de Football Association (Fifa) will provide the largest share, at Sh454 million, while grants from the Confederation of African Football (Caf) will amount to Sh10 million. Some Sh730 million will come from local sources, while mobile service provider Safaricom, under the ‘Chapa Dimba’ competition, will provide Sh47 million. ADMINISTRATIVEThe leagues and other competitions will consume the largest amount, at Sh745,570,180, followed by technical development (Sh236,392,350), and staff salaries at Sh85,028,563. Governance, which includes holding NEC and AGM meetings, among others, will consume Sh13 million, with administrative costs taking up Sh30,598,000. Marketing and communication will use up Sh37,968,750. Safaricom Chapa Dimba and capital costs, among others, will take Sh93 million. SPONSORSHIPHowever, for a federation struggling to get sponsorship even for the national football team, Harambee Stars, FKF should reduce the expenditure. Spending more than Sh13 million on meetings, for instance, is imprudent. And with FKF president Nick Mwendwa disclosing that close to 42 firms had turned them down as they sought sponsorship, that doesn’t augur well for the country’s most popular sport.With Fifa having increased its funding to FKF, we expect the sport’s managers to be transparent and accountable. FKF should also help to improve port’s infrastructure, especially playgrounds. It was a shame that Kenya failed to host the 2018 African Nations Championship (Chan) in January owing to lack of facilities and tangible progress in preparations.
