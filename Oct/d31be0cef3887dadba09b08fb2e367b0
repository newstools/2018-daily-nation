The withdrawal of two English textbooks from the school curriculum over questionable content is an indictment of the quality control systems in the Ministry of Education. It is even more disgraceful that the books have been in use since the beginning of the year and that they were specifically published for the new curriculum to be rolled out in January. Still, it took the intervention of keen parents, who raised their concerns through an aggressive social media campaign, for the publisher, the Jomo Kenyatta Foundation, to capitulate under the mounting pressure and recall the books. PERFORMANCE INDICATOR It may well be argued that these are only two books out of hundreds being used in primary and secondary schools and that such recalls, while not uncommon, are few and far between. Unfortunately, this incident raises a poignant question on the preparedness of the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to shepherd the country into the new curriculum in just two months. If it’s the KICD’s sole mandate to evaluate and approve all learning materials, it has failed in its basic performance indicator. REVIEW PROCEDURES Were the books taken through the usual stringent quality vetting systems? Was it laxity or sloppiness by the employees responsible for approving books? Could some steps in the approvals have been compromised deliberately? The least the institute can do is to answer these and other relevant questions besides explaining to the public how it plans to seal the loopholes. Notably, the director has been quick to apologise to the public for the blunders but the offensive content may already have caused damage to the young minds. The institute must immediately undertake a review of its procedures to avoid such errors. More importantly, it must identify the those responsible for the errors and facilitate investigations and punishment of culprits.
