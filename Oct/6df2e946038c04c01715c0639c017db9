The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) is on Wednesday set to commission the first-ever college to train public and non-state actors on integrity in bid to tame corruption. This comes after the Technical and Vocational Education and Training Authority approved establishment of the program. “It will offer training and capacity building in the areas of ethics, integrity, anti-corruption and good governance to both internal and external clients of the commission,” the anti-graft commission said in a statement on Tuesday. The school, National Integrity Academy, started operations on July 18 and learners have been receiving training at the Kenya Leadership and Integrity Forum on Ngong Road, Nairobi. “The Countrywide Needs Assessment (TNA) conducted by the commission in 2016 revealed that the national and county governments need specialized anti-corruption and ethics capacity building for purposes of entrenching good governance, mainstreaming anti-corruption, integrity and sealing corruption loopholes in their systems, policies and procedures of work at the institutional level,” EACC said. Among the main functions of the academy will be to develop and review an anti-corruption curriculum and engage in capacity building on various sectors to combat runway corruption. The college will be launched on Wednesday by the Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum.   Officials locked up at Karatina Police Station in Nyeri as investigations continue.
