The Kenya National Examination Council (Knec) has said results for the ongoing Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams will be out next month. Speaking at Uhuru Gardens Primary School in Nairobi on Wednesday, Knec chairman Prof George Magoha said the results will be out by end of November after which the selection for Form One slots will begin immediately. “We are confident that results will be out by end of November. This will be followed by the Form One placement process that will see students report to secondary schools early January next year,” Mr Magoha said. The Knec boss had accompanied President Uhuru Kenyatta who made an impromptu visit to the school to inspect the conduct of the exams and encourage candidates. President Kenyatta had a one-on-one chit-chat with the pupils who were about to seat their Kiswahili paper. “All you need to do is do your best, exams are just an event. There are many more events in life which you will need to overcome,” President Kenyatta said as the pupils clapped in joy. The President assured the candidates that they will all get a chance to join secondary schools. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed, who was also at the event, assured the President of the integrity of the exams as the exercise continues across the country. Other education officials who accompanied the President in the early morning visit are: Education Chief Administrative Secretary Prof Colleta Suda and Teachers Service Commission chief executive Nancy Macharia. A total of 1,060,703 candidates are sitting this year's end of primary school examination.   Some candidates failed to sit the exam because they were not registered.
