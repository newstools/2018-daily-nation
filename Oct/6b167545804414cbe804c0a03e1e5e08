Four jetties in Lamu County will be renovated at a cost of Sh649 million starting next month as the State looks to accommodate increasing trade volumes. The jetties - Mokowe, Mangrove and Manda Airport, all in Lamu West, and Mtangawanda in Lamu East- will be expanded to handle more boats, travellers and cargo, ministry officials have said. Transport and Infrastructure Principal Secretary Paul Maringa said the government has already set aside Sh520 million for Mokowe, Sh62 million for the Mtangawanda and Sh32 million for Lamu Mangrove. Manda Airport Jetty works will cost the taxpayer Sh35 million. Speaking during an inspection tour of various jetties in Lamu on Wednesday, Prof Maringa said preliminary requests, including drawing works and the general planning have already been finalised. The jetties, he said, will all be ready by May, 2019. “We have found that some of the jetties are structurally unsound and need repairs. For the Mokowe Customs Jetty, we expect it to be complete in two years’ time,” said Prof Maringa. Structural Engineer in the State Department of Public Works Hillary Nyaanga said the construction works include expansion of some of the landing sites. “We will have to construct the Mokowe Jetty afresh and in a modern style. We want it to have the large waiting bay, a mini-petrol station. It will also be designed in such a way that will accommodate the disabled.   The government has released Sh130 million to renovate four key jetties in Lamu County which are structurally unsound.
