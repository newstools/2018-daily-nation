The Ministry of Sports on Thursday announced free entry for fans wishing to attend the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match pitting Harambee Stars against Ethiopia's Walya Antelopes at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. The two East African giants clash for the second time in fours day on Sunday following their 0-0 draw in Bahir Dar on Wednesday which saw Harambee Stars leapfrog Ghana to the summit of the Group F standings on four points. A win for Sebastien Migne's Stars will take the country to the brink of qualification to the 2019 Nations Cup after a 14-year hiatus. “Harambee Stars has continued to perform well in the Afcon matches where Kenya has beaten Ghana and drawn with Ethiopia, in this respect, the government has stepped up support for the team to ensure that Kenya qualifies for Afcon 2019 championships to be held in Cameroon,” Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa said in a statement on Thursday. “I wish to announce that entrance to the stadium at Kasarani will be free of charge to allow Kenyans cheer their team to victory. Consequently it’s important that as patriotic Kenyans it is our duty to support the team unreservedly.”   Harambee Stars will host Ethiopia on Sunday at the Kasarani Stadium.
