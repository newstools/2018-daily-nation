IN DAR ES SALAAM Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) men's basketball team were bundled out of the Fiba Zone Five Club Championships at the semi final stage after going down 81-57 to Smouha from Egypt here at the Dar es Salaam Indoor Courts on Sunday. The Dockers, who played a match improved game compared to how they started the championships, gave their all but were too inferior for the more tactful Egyptians. Smouha led 18-5 in the first quarter and 39-26 at the break, before exploding to 59-38 in the third quarter putting the game beyond the reach of KPA. Inspirational James Justice, arguably the best play maker here, scored game high 26 points to lead the Egyptians' onslaught, while Ali Fathi had 16. The Kenyans, who resorted to a physical game to contain their opponents, had Victor Bosire lead their offence 15 points, while Arou Liu and James Mwangi contributed seven points each. "We gave the game our all but truth be told, the Egyptians did their homework better and won," KPA assistant coach Mike Opel said. Smouha tactician Ashraf Tawfiq was however not very impressed with the Dockers' physical approach to the game, saying his main players sustained unnecessary injuries ahead of the final. "I thought they were a bit too physical on us but it's good we won", he said. In a match played earlier, champions KPA women defeated Uganda Christian University 49-34 to set up a decisive final round robin final clash with bitter rivals Equity Bank set for Sunday evening. Both KPA and Equity have not lost a match, meaning that the winner of the clash will be crowned champions.
