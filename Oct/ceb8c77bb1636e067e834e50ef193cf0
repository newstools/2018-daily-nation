Eleven people were arrested in Narok County on Wednesday after science and Kiswahili papers for the national exams went missing. They are the headteacher of Oloonamuka Primary School in Narok County, three of his colleagues and three security officers. PROBE The 11 were taken to Olpusimoru Police Station for interrogation and the security officers replaced. The test papers for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Educations (KCPE) examinations went missing while being taken to the school. Narok County Commissioner George Natembeya and a team of security agents swung into action following the report. “A lady collected the exams in a container at the Olokurto division education office and put them in a handbag. How they slipped out of the vehicle is a matter of investigations,” said Mr Natembeya. He led the security team in searching for the papers in villages. Mr Natembeya said education officials were forced to find a quick alternative for the pupils. “The pupils will write their tests without a hitch,” he told the Nation on phone. Meanwhile, 31 pupils of different schools in Narok East did not take the tests as they dropped out due to pregnancy. “Others were married off. We are following up on individual cases,” said Mr Natembeya.   Matiang'i says the lists will help facilitate placement and smooth transition of the candidates to Form One.
