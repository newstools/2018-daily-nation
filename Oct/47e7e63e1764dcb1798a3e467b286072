The Khartoum International Airport has been closed following a collision between two military planes on Wednesday. The Soviet-era Antonov aircraft had landed within seconds of each other when the accident occurred, an airport official said. Airport authority spokesman Mohamed Mahdi, however, told the local media that no casualties has been reported in the incident. But another official who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity said eight people were injured and taken to hospital. Video footage posted on social media showed two planes moving along the runway before one suddenly rams the tail of the other. Both planes appeared to have been badly damaged in pictures posted online. Mr Mahdi confirmed that an investigation had been launched into the incident. The Sudanese army has no commented on the incident. Wednesday's accident is the third to have hit Sudan's ageing military fleet in less than a month. On September 21, two pilots were killed when their military jet crashed near Omdurman, the twin city of Khartoum on the west bank of the Nile. It came days after a military helicopter crashed on landing in Darfur. All passengers were rescued as the helicopter caught fire. Most of Sudan's fleet consists of Russian-made aircraft, and in recent years it has suffered several crashes, with the military frequently blaming technical problems and bad weather.
