Parents are to blame for the high number of school dropouts at Marioshoni in Elburgon, an administrator has said. Area chief Samson Salimu said: "Parents and guardians have neglected their roles and responsibilities. Many family conflicts have been reported in my office. This contributes to studentsâ€™ absence and the increase in number of school dropouts," Molo Sub-County Director of Education Joseph Chebor urged parents to take their roles seriously. "A number of parents do not provide basic necessities for their children," he said. Mr Chebor warned boda boda operators who have been preying on young girls, saying the law will soon catch up with them.
