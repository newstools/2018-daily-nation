The Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) has issued the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) with a seven-day notice to reconvene talks on teachers' welfare or face the consequences. A meeting in Naivasha collapsed after TSC rejected a demand to revoke the transfer of 85 headteachers holding union positions. "We read disinterest on your part as regards the resolution of the unresolved issues. We justifiably read mischief and mistrust on your part. We are keen on protecting the rights of our members as enshrined in the Constitution and relevant labour laws," Knut Secretary-General Wilson Sossion told TSC Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia in a letter dated October 18. TSC and Knut were to meet on Friday but the former deferred the talks. Mrs Macharia notified Mr Sossion that the meeting had been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. "The Commission wishes to therefore seek your indulgence so that the meeting may be rescheduled to a further date that is convenient to both parties," the letter dated October 17 read. APPRAISALSDuring the Naivasha meeting, the TSC also rejected a demand to have such headteachers exempted from future transfers, a move that saw deliberations on the issue pushed to another date. The meeting had also been called to discuss performance appraisal and promotion of more than 30,000 teachers who have attained higher academic qualifications, among others. The 10-member joint team failed to agree on four of the six issues on the agenda. According to the eight-page document, the team could only agree on the delocalisation policy. The threat comes ahead of the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams scheduled for next week.
