Harambee Starlets has been pooled in Group B alongside Africa Women's Cup of Nations defending champions Nigeria in the 2018 edition scheduled for November 17 to December 1 in Ghana. South Africa, who've qualified for previous three editions, and Zambia complete Group B. Hosts Ghana are in group A with Mali, Cameroon and Algeria. Starlets are making a second consecutive appearance at the women championship after making their debut in 2016 where they lost all group B games. They returned for this eleventh edition after Equatorial Guinea, who had eliminated them 3-2 on aggregate in the final qualification round in June, were disqualified by Caf for fielding ineligible players. The best three sides from the eight-team biennial competition will advance to the 2019 Fifa Women's World Cup slated for June 7 to July 7 in France.   Eight countries will be divided into two groups of four teams each.
