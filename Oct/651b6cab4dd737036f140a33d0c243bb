The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) candidate in the Migori senatorial by-election, Mr Ochilo Ayacko, has praised the electoral agency's preparedness for tomorrow's exercise. Addressing the media on Sunday at Hill View Hotel, the former Rongo MP and Energy minister expressed confidence in clinching the seat. He also dismissed claims that he is anxious about Federal Party of Kenya candidate Eddy Oketch's chances of winning. "The fact that top ODM leadership came here to campaign for me does not mean that we are scared of him. We have no apologies that our party is big and commands a big following," he said. Further, Mr Ayacko said that the police officers deployed to provide security have so far conducted themselves professionally. He urged all voters to cast their ballots. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission communication boss Andrew Limo said: "Electronic transmission of results will not be used in the by-election. Results from polling stations will be scanned and sent to the county tallying centre before being relayed to the public." Also, commissioner Abdi Guliye and Regional Police Commander Leonard Katana said all is set for the big day. Polling materials have been distributed to the eight constituencies.   Migori senate race is seen as a two-horse race between Ochillo Ayacko and Eddy Oketch.
