Drama unfolded at Eldoret Central Police Station on Monday after suspects defecated in cells in a bid to avoid being taken to court. Operations at the station were paralysed for hours after the suspects smeared human waste on the walls and floor of the cell. Some are said to have thrown the stool to officers. UNPLEASANT SMELL The more than 20 suspects, who were arrested on Sunday, were to be taken to court in the morning when their three counterparts defecated in the cells. Uasin Gishu Chief Fire Officer Peter Kurgat said his department was called to clean the mess. “Due to our close working relationship with the police officers, we were called to clean the cells after suspects decided to soil the place with their waste. They had smeared stool up to the reception section, and we have cleaned it. I’m told they did not want to appear in court,” Mr Kurgat told Nation. The incident attracted curious residents, who thronged the station to find out what was going on. “I came here in the morning to find out if my brother, who was arrested on Sunday, could be released. But when I arrived, I was welcomed by an unpleasant smell of human waste,” said Mr Geoffrey Juma. “I was told by one of the officers that services have been put on hold. I saw one of suspects throwing his stool to an officer,” added Mr Juma. Police later managed to take the suspects to court to answer TO the charges they were facing. Senior officers, however, declined to comment on the incident.
