Coast football fans will be allowed free entrance to watch Bandari play Thika United in their last SportPesa Premier league match at Mbaraki Sports Club in Mombasa on Sunday. Bandari Chief Executive Officer Edward Oduor told Nation Sport that they felt it was prudent to appreciate the fans who pushed the team to a historic second place finish this season. “I’m happy to say that we’ve achieved what we aimed for, to complete the league in the top three places. That's why we are giving free access to our fans for this match. We’ll be aiming to win the premier league crown in the coming season,” said Oduor. He appealed to fans to turn up in great numbers and cheer the team as they have done all year. It is the first club from the region to finish second since the start of the modern day Kenya Premier league (KPL). He revealed that the club has organised an awards gala after the match. Those to be awarded are the season best player, best goalkeeper, best defender, best midfielder, best striker and the most disciplined player “The party will be held at the club immediately after the match and we’ll award to those players who perform well throughout. We want to award the players as a way to encourage them to perform better next season,” said Oduor. As part of celebrations for their second place finish, Bandari will visit Lamu, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Tana River and Kilifi counties to meet their fans. The Dockers will be out to get maximum points against Thika United to increase their points tally and became the first team from the region to go past the 60 points mark.
