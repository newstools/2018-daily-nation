The government has finally released Sh15.4billion for free day primary and subsidised secondary education. Education Principal Secretary Bellio Kipsang on Monday announced that Sh2.8billion will go to primary schools and Sh12.6billion to secondary schools. SMOOTH OPERATIONS “We have this released funds to schools to enable them run their activities effectively,” said Dr Kipsang. He spoke during a meeting at Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD), Nairobi County, where he also addressed measures to stamp out cheating in the 2018 national examinations. Kenya Secondary School Heads Association (Kessha) chairman Kahi Indimuli welcomed the development saying schools will be managed effectively. Kenya Primary School Heads Association (Kepsha) National Treasurer Joseph Otiende lauded the government for releasing the funds. Primary, special needs and secondary school heads had complained about a one month delay in the release of the money, some having faced difficulties providing essential services to learners. Last month, Kessha asked Parliament to help address the issue. “Delays lead to failure to provide services and payment of salaries to non-teaching staff and the board of management,” Mr Indimuli noted. Last week, the National Assembly reduced the budget of the Ministry of Education by Sh1billion in respect of the expenditure. Schools re-opened for third term late in September and are expected to close on October 26 to allow 1.7 million candidates to sit for their national examinations.   Magoha says three of the schools are in Garissa, four in Kisii and five are in Meru.
