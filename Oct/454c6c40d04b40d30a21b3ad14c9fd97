The fate of five Nairobi County ministers hangs in the balance after City Hall advertised their positions. The Nairobi County Public Service Board has, on its website, called for competent and qualified individuals to apply for the positions. The applicants are required to have knowledge in fields including economics, commerce, investment, law, engineering, finance, business administration and natural resources. The board’s chairman Philip Kungu said Governor Mike Sonko notified the board of his intention to recruit new Cabinet ministers. “The County Executive Committee (CEC) members' contracts have expired. He will seek to renew some of the contracts but will replace others. I don't know who they are or the sector they represent,” said Mr Kungu. Currently, the health and devolution dockets have no heads after Ms Veska Kangongo, who was heading both, was suspended by the governor last month for insubordination. Former health executive Hitan Majevdia was also suspended in August for alleged laxity. “Let us not be presumptuous. The governor can seek to replace all of them if he wants to. That is up to him. We really cannot question that, because it is his prerogative,” said Mr Kungu.   Nairobi County health bosses contradict governor Sonko’s alleged discovery of bodies of newborns stuffed in boxes.
