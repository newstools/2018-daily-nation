The National Government has postponed a meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and musicians to allow for adequate preparations. Spokesman Eric Kiraithe on Sunday said that the government received more than 10,000 requests from musicians wishing to attend the forum, which is meant to discuss issues afflicting the industry. "To allow for adequate preparations so that the meeting meets the intended purpose and systematically improve the music industry in Kenya, the October 16 meeting has been postponed," he said in a press statement. Mr Kiraithe said the Sports ministry has been directed to establish a multisectoral team to organise the meeting. "The President is keen to meet musicians at the earliest possible opportunity, and therefore the ministry has been directed to expedite these preparations." He said the meeting must address all crucial concerns of musicians and that the resolutions should be sustainable. Mr Kenyatta made the invitation on Thursday last week in Murang'a during the burial of benga artiste Joseph Kamaru.
