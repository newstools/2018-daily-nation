Kenya has in recent months witnessed a wave of killings that has left many citizens shocked and terribly worried. Almost every other day, we hear of one gruesome murder after another, carried out either by hired hitmen or killers driven by motives only known to themselves. These incidents have left families, friends and associates of the victims devastated and crying out for justice. In a number of the cases, arrests have been made and the suspects taken to court and their fate lies in the hands of the criminal justice system. The most logical expectation is that investigators have done a thorough job and presented watertight evidence that will withstand the rigours and demands of the criminal process. The history of murder trials in this country is not flattering. In many cases, some involving high-profile individuals as victims, the prosecution could not meet the high threshold set by the law to secure convictions for murder, leading to the release of the suspects. But the prosecution only relies on evidence collected, analysed and interpreted by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). In many trials, it is let down by shoddy investigations, complicity and corruption and lack of resources and modern facilities for forensic tests. Evidence and scenes of crime have also been tampered with. For the DCI to meet the high expectations of Kenyans, it has to be fully equipped to tackle the increasingly complex murders that we are witnessing. Similarly, the personnel deployed in the agency must be sufficiently trained and motivated to carry out their work diligently. Only then will those inclined to commit murder get the loud and clear message that there will be no escape from the long arm of the law.
