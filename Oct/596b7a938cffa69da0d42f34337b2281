You will not be able to travel with your passport after October 2019, the Department of Immigration has said. Dr Dan Opon, the Senior Assistant Director of Immigration said on Monday that the current Kenyan passport will expire on September 1 so Kenyans should acquire e-passports by March next year. INTEGRATION “No country will accept the current passport from September next year,” Dr Opon said when launching a new report on free and safe movement in East Africa. Dr Opon said the department has started implementing the announcement President Uhuru Kenyatta made last year. “The government’s efforts to promote regional integration by opening up territorial access to migrants is evidence of our position and commitment. To this end, the Department of Immigration is developing a National Migration Policy framework and has harmonised classification of work permits and encourage free movement of persons within the East African Community,” he said. The government is also establishing the National Coordination Mechanism on migration. It will serve as a forum for all migration stakeholders, ministries, the academia and the civil society to engage with bilateral and multilateral partners on promoting safe and orderly migration in the region. The government is also working in partnership with the University of Nairobi to develop a curriculum for a post-graduate diploma that will be launched in November. Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda developed a coalition of the willing that allows citizens of the three countries to travel using their national identity cards. Dr Opon noted, however, that a single visa territory within the East African Community remains elusive because the harmonisation of immigration practices and policies is yet to happen.   The project is a presidential initiative that would first profile all public servants and their property and relations.
