Joram Lumbasi will be looking to retain his title in the Family Bank Half Marathon in Eldoret on Sunday. The Iten-based athlete said that he will be participating in the race as he prepares to compete in other road races abroad. “I have been training well and I will be expecting stiff competition because all athletes participating are in good shape. I will be using the race to gauge my performance ahead of other international road races this season,” said Lumbasi. This even as the newly crowned Kaptagat Half Marathon champion Cynthia Cherop will also be featuring in the women category. The athlete, who has been training in Iten, is expected to use the race as part of her preparations to compete in the Standard Chartered Marathon in Nairobi.More than 700 athletes have registered to participate in today’s race, which marks the 12th edition of the event. Family Group Foundation Manager Jacqueline Mathaga on Friday said registration has been ongoing in the bank’s branches situated in Eldoret West, Eldoret East, Kericho, Kapsabet, Nakuru, Kitale, among other towns. Mathaga said that the race has changed its name from Family Bank Marathon to Family Group Foundation Marathon. Winners in both men’s and women’s half marathon races will take home Sh250,000 and runners-up Sh150,000 and Sh100,000 respectively. The race, which was inaugurated in 2007 as Family Bank Marathon, has produced talented athletes, among them former world marathon record holder Wilson Kipsang. “As organisers of the race, we have changed the marathon route this year so as to make it better, favourable and more competitive to the participants,” Mathaga said in Eldoret Town. Unlike the previous years when the race has started in Eldoret’s central business district, this year the men and women’s 21km races will start at Tendwo High School.
