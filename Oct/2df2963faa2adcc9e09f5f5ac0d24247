Strong winds and high seas are expected along the Kenyan coastal waters for the next three days, the Ministry of Environment has said. The advisory targets small vessels, fishermen and inexperienced sailors. “Strong to at times very strong south to southeast winds and high seas are expected to prevail across Kenya coastal waters. Small craft advisory is in effect from Tuesday through Friday,” read the urgent marine weather message from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The ministry said the winds are expected to be of speeds between 15 to 24 knots and of gusts around 33 knots. The waves/seas will be of wave heights of 6 to 7 feet near shore with occasional seas of up to 12 feet. “A small craft advisory means that wind speeds of 21 to 33 knots are or wave heights of 7 feet of greater are expected to produce hazardous conditions to small craft,” warned the marine meteorological port office in Mombasa. Inexperienced mariners or sailors, especially those operating smaller vessels, are cautioned against navigating in those conditions. Fishermen and other mariners are also warned to pay close attraction to marine forecast and consider wind and sea conditions before going for their expeditions in the sea.
