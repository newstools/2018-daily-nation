Kenya says it has received a pledge of 215,000 Euros (about Sh24.9 million) as funding from the European Union towards the upcoming conference on the blue economy. Foreign Affairs PS Macharia Kamau Monday said the amount, which is equivalent to more than a quarter of the total budget for the meeting, forms part of a pool of funds from donors ahead of the conference. “The EU has confirmed 215,000 Euros, a donation in support of the blue economy conference to be held in (Nairobi) on November 26 to 28, 2018,” the PS said. The conference is being co-hosted by Kenya and Canada and is seen as part of the country’s move to engage stakeholders on how to harness sea, lake and river resources, commonly called the blue economy. THEME The theme of the meeting, which organisers say may attract up to 4,000 participants, is: "Blue Economy and the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development", reflecting a connection with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. A document on the website of the conference says the meeting “will focus on new technologies and innovation for oceans, seas, lakes and rivers as well as the challenges, potential opportunities, priorities and partnerships.” But Kenya is seeking to raise up to Sh800 million to ensure the conference runs smoothly. Already, Canada, who are the co-hosts, have put in Sh200 million plus another Sh100 million in non-monetary contributions for the conference. Other countries such as Portugal, Norway, the United Kingdom, Fiji and South Africa have also indicated they will contribute, according to a document provided by the ministry on Monday. The UNDP, Capital Markets Authority, and the Ocean Foundation are some of the non-state donors who have also pledged to support the conference.   Other countries that will also contribute money are UK, Norway, Portugal, Fiji and South Africa.
