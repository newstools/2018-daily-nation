Migori Governor Okoth Obado was taken to the hospital Wednesday after becoming ill in remand. Mr Obado was admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital's private wing at around 12pm, acting Clinical Services Director Dr Peter Masinde confirmed. “He is sick, but not in critical condition,” Dr Masinde said, adding that he is not allowed to give details of what the governor is suffering from. Mr Obado has been in police custody at the Industrial Area Remand Prison in Nairobi since last week after he was charged with the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno. He was charged with killing Ms Otieno, an offence he allegedly committed between September 3 and 4 at Owade in Rachuonyo, Homa Bay County. The charge stated that he committed the offence with others not before the court. Last week, a judge rejected his application to be released on bond. Justice Jessie Lessit rejected the application, saying the court was yet to see the witness statements and documentary evidence to be used in the case to make a determination as to whether it was okay to free him on bond.   Sleuths turn focus on those close to the governor, including his wife and aides, say motive for murder seems clear.
