Kenya’s Brigid Kosgei atoned for her second place finish last year to win this year’s Chicago Marathon in personal best of 2 hour, 18 minutes and 35 seconds on Sunday. Kosgei, who had finished at London Marathon in April in another personal best of 2:20:13, broke away with a huge lead near the end of the race, outpacing her closest competitor, Ethiopia’s Roza Dereje. Kosgei appeared to enjoy the rains as she put behind her loss to Ethiopia’s Tirunesh Dibaba last year to win with the sixth fastest time ever in the Windy City race. Kosgei finished second in Chicago last year, setting a big personal best of 2:20:22. Nine weeks later, she won the Honolulu Marathon in 2:22:15, taking more than five minutes off the course record. Kosgei opened her 2018 season with a boom, finishing second in London after losing the battle to compatriot Vivian Cheruiyot, improving her personal best to 2:20:13. Before heading to Chicago, Kosgei clocked 1:07:52 effort at the Great North Run, finishing a close second to London Marathon champion Vivian Cheruiyot “I was worried but the rains but I felt strong as I cruised on,” said Kosgei, who edged out Dereje to second place in 2:21:18 as another Ethiopian Shure Demise settled third in 2:22:15. It was also Kosgei’s maiden victory in the World Marathon Majors and she will take home the winner’s prize purse of US$ 100,000 (Sh 10million). The 24-year-old has now finished first or second in eight of her nine career marathons. The 2015 and 2016 champion Florence Kiplagat settled fourth in 2:26:08 with compatriot Veronicah Nyaruai finishing fifth but in personal best 2:31:34. RESULTS 1. Brigid Kosgei (KEN) 2:18:35 2.
