AFC Leopards will drop eleven players from the current squad and recruit five ahead of the new season scheduled to kick off on December 8, 2018. This is a repeat of happenings at the club last season when they parted ways with 11 and signed 10 new ones. Club Secretary, Oscar Igaida also confirmed that the executive is in the process of hiring a new coach to replace Rodolfo Zapata who left last month. “We shall be releasing some players on recommendation from our technical bench. Those who performed will remain as we embark on the plan to trim the squad from 31 to 25,” he said. Zapata advised Leopards to sign five quality players who should be good enough to start matches for the team to avoid a situation where some players only make five appearances per season and hang on to their young players. Igaida also revealed that Victor Bwibo has replaced Jacob Abisai as the new Chief Executive Officers (CEO) of the club. “Being a financial planner, we expect him to market the club internationally,” said Igaida. AFC Leopards who started the league on a high note struggled towards the end failing to win any silverware after playing most matches without eight key players. Igaida thanked the players, branch members and supporters for supporting with the team through their various challenges. AFC Leopards are training to face Ulinzi Stars at Kasarani on October 20 for the third playoff match of the SportPesa Shield. Sofapaka beat Leopards 1-0 in the semis to sail into the final where they will face Kariobangi Sharks. Igaida said the team will break after the match for two weeks before resuming training on November 5. There is also a scheduled retreat for the team where all issues will be sorted out. The technical bench under Tom Juma as the acting coach remains intact. Juma is assisted by team manager Gilbert Selebwa, goalkeeper trainer Mathew "Ottamax" Owino and team doctor Patrick Ngusale.
