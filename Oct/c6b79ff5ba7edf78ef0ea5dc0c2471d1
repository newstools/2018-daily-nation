A 14-seater matatu burst into flames on Juja Road on Wednesday morning with passengers on board. The vehicle was full of passengers, who escaped unhurt in the incident that happened in the Huruma Flats area. The PinPoint Sacco matatu was plying from Kayole to Eastleigh. The incident happened at 8:45am.   Mr James Muigai, 35, owner and driver of the vehicle, said that something exploded inside the vehicle in the second row of the passenger seats. “Niliskia mlipuko na gari ikaanza kuchomeka (I heard an explosion and then the vehicle burst into flames)," Mr Muigai said.   “Some of them (passengers) jumped through the windows,” he added.   Deadly crash occured hardly a day after the Traffic police boss warned about sharp rise in road fatalities.
