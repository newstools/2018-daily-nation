Teachers held demonstrations on Tuesday morning over alleged delayed investigating into the murder of a teacher and his wife in Chesingoro, Kericho County. Mr Willy Sang, 50, was murdered alongside his wife Everline, 42, at their home in July. POLICE BLAMED Teachers accused accused police of failing to deliver justice for their colleague and his wife. Acting Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers National Chairman Julius Korir and Kericho branch Secretary Julius Mibei led the teachers and residents in camping outside the home of the slain couple before proceeding to Litein town, where they held demonstrations. "We are giving the police 24 hours to arrest the main suspects in the murder of Mr and Mrs Sang. If not, let Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i transfer the security team in Kericho and send another," said  Mr Korir. The badly mutilated bodies of Mr Sang, a teacher at Cheborgei High School, and his wife, were found in a pool of blood in their bedroom on July 21. The main suspects are family friends, a wife of a bishop and their children, who were being hosted by the family. CALL FOR JUSTICE Mr Mibei wondered why other high profile killings like that of Sharon Otieno and Monica Kimani were being followed to the latter “while justice has been aborted in the case of sang". "We want justice for his children, teachers and the people of Chesingoro. The DCI and county commissioner should up their game or go home," said Mr Mibei.   Gabrielle Maina was killed as she walked on Miotoni Road in Karen last week.
