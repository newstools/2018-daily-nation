Nakumatt forward Joe Waithera played his last match for the club signing off in style with a brace against Ushuru at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Sunday to help the team retain Kenyan Premier League (KPL) status with a 3-0 aggregate score. Waithera, who joined Nakumatt in June, is set to be unveiled at the relegated side next week among other big names as they plan their way back into the top flight. “I feel good that I have given my best here, I wanted to leave the team where I found it and had to commit myself, thank God I scored the two goals,” Waithera told Nation Sport after the match. He added: “So many people have discouraged me against going back to the NSL (National Super League) but it’s a personal decision, whatever I decide comes from my heart and all my plans are dedicated to God.” At Wazito, he joins NSL top scorer Stephen Owusu, Victor Ndinya and left back Washington Munene from Nairobi Stima. The team, which finished 17th in the top flight, have also re-signed Dennis Gicheru and Anthony Gathu from Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Kennedy Ayako while Piscas Muhindo returns after a loan deal at Sofapaka. Zoo goalkeeper Vincent Misikhu, Wilson Anekeya (Kakamega Homeboyz), Joshua Orem (Bidco United) and Cain Okeyo (Sony Sugar) are some of the new faces set to be unveiled at the club.   Joseph Waithera claimed a brace as Nakumatt emerged 2-0 winners.
