The thinking behind the decision to lower entry grades into teacher training colleges for candidates in the marginalised areas is understandable. However, this would be the wrong way to go about it. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Teachers Service Commission has flatly rejected it. With no special national examinations for the students in the North, giving them mediocre teachers will only worsen the situation. The TSC and the Ministry of Education are committed to improving the standard of teaching and learning countrywide. This is only possible if, right from the grassroots, learners have the best tutors from an early age. Lowering entry grades for trainee teachers will undermine the quality of teaching. There are other openings for students who score grade D in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam. They are certainly not material for teacher training and should, instead, pursue training in skills as artisans or such careers. SHARPEN INTELLECT One of the most glaring challenges in these regions is an acute teacher shortage. This has lately been worsened by attacks in places such as Mandera and Wajir, which have led to an exodus of non-native teachers, leaving the schools severely understaffed. Kenyan children deserve the very best to compete fairly for entry into institutions of higher learning and the professions. It will be pushing these remote areas into further marginalisation by creating for them an inferior cadre of teachers. And to give all our children a fair chance, they must be exposed to an environment that fully sharpens their intellect, abilities and skills. There is a need to enhance security and prevent criminals from denying some Kenyans, including teachers, their constitutional right to freely work and live anywhere in the country.
