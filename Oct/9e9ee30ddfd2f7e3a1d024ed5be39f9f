Tragedy hit the Vohra family, which owns the Sarova Hotels, Sunday as four family members died in a road accident at Makindu. Police said Sarova Hotels chairman Mohinder Singh Vohra, his wife Swarna Devi Vohra and two other family members died when their driver Saveer Vohra lost control of the car. He is admitted in hospital in critical condition. The other two family members were identified as Reena Kaur Vohra, their daughter, and Atu Vohra, daughter-in-law. The SUV that the family members were travelling — a Toyota Landcruiser — in to Nairobi veered off the road and landed in a ditch, according to Mukaa OCPD Charles Muthui. The family members were travelling back to Nairobi from a religious ceremony at Makindu Sikh Temple to mark the death of their son, Jaideep S Vohra, a rally enthusiast who died in a road accident last year. Jaideep, who was the managing director of Sarova Hotels, which include Whitesands, Stanley and Panafric died in November 2017 when his vehicle rolled near Amboseli Lodge as he drove to watch the East African Safari Classic Rally. Another relative of the family, Sandy, died in Ethiopia in 2006, also through a road accident. “The driver lost control of his motor vehicle hitting a culvert and landing on the right hand side of the road,” said Mr Muthui. Mr Saveer Vorha was first admitted at the hospital with leg injuries before he was flown to a hospital in Nairobi for specialized treatment. Bodies of the four relatives were moved to Machakos County Referral hospital mortuary while the wreck of the ill-fated vehicle was towed to Salama Police Station. Editor's Note The print version of this article inaccurately described the age of Mr Mohinder Singh Vohra and Swarna Devi Vohra. The article also incorrectly identified MS Vohra as the chairman of Sarova Hotels, instead of Mr John Ngata Kariuki. Mr Kariuki was not involved in the Sunday accident.
