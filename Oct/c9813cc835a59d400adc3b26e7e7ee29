Sweden-based Eric Mapake Johanna has the dedicated their 3-0 win over Ethiopia in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Group “F” qualifier to thousands of fans who thronged the 60,000-capacity Kasarani stadium on Sunday. The former Mathare United midfielder says their early streaming in to the stadium motivated them to give back to the fans. “We were relaxing in camp in the morning following how they were turning up at the stadium from wee hours and we just wanted to give back, they didn’t deserve to be disappointed,” the 2015 Kenyan Premier League (KPL) midfielder of the year said after the game. He added: “I am happy with my contribution, it’s a nice feeling but what’s important is to focus on the next game as a team. We are anxiously waiting for the final against Sierra Leone next month and are not concerned about their suspension status, and we will prepare to take them on here.” The 24-year-old, who turns out for Swedish top tier side IF Brommapojkarna, has five goals in 24 games for Harambee Stars. Sunday's strike was his second in the Afcon qualifiers after scoring a stunner in a 2-1 win over Congo Brazzaville in the 2017 Afcon qualifiers in 2016 at the same venue.   Migne was delighted with his players’ output after struggling in the 0-0 draw.
