Meghan Markle displayed an unexpected talent for "welly wanging" in Auckland Tuesday, gaining bragging rights over husband Prince Harry after they competed in the oddball New Zealand sport. When she married into Britain's Royal Family in London five months ago, it's doubtful Meghan envisaged her duties would include standing in a rain-soaked paddock half a world away, hurling a wellington boot into the distance. But as schoolchildren on her team chanted "Meghan, Meghan, Meghan", the pregnant duchess gave a flick of the wrist and sent her red-and-white polka dot welly sailing past Harry's best effort. Clutching her prize, a miniature mounted wellington boot, the American-born former actress told her team: "You should put it in your school. Now that'll make a show and tell!" Pinehill School pupil Isabella Iti said there was a friendly rivalry between the couple as they lined up for the big event. "I think she was thinking that there was no chance that she would win. But she did," she said. Wellington throwing is one of the unusual activities seen at rural fairs and fundraisers in New Zealand, along with wood chopping, olive-pit spitting and speed tree-climbing. Despite her impressive performance, Meghan would need to train hard to match former Commonwealth decathlete Brent Newdick, who once reportedly threw his welly 48.5 metres only to be disqualified because he was not a local. Earlier, the royals helped plant native trees as part of an environmental project. They are in the final days of a jam-packed 16-day tour that has included more than 70 engagements in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.   The traditional skirts are a status symbol worn during formal occasions.
