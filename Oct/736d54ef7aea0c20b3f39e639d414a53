Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria and members of the county assembly (MCAs) Saturday snubbed Mashujaa Day celebrations held at Gakoigo Stadium in Maragua, sparking protests from local leaders. The governor had two weeks ago sworn not to work with County Commissioner John Elungata, accusing him of working with his rivals and using police to intimidate him in the raging water wars. "I have cut my engagements with the county commissioner and his appointing authority should take note of that and transfer him as he is not representing the interests of the national government," the governor told the Nation two weeks ago. But the county commissioner opted not to respond to Mr Wa Iria's accusations, telling the Nation that he would not comment on the matter. NDAKAINI FORUM The governor’s statement came after police officers dispersed MCAs using tear gas when they tried to access Ndakaini shopping centre for a public participation forum. Leaders present at the poorly-attended Mashujaa Day ceremony at Gakoigo termed Mr Wa Iria’s absence as regrettable, maintaining that his presence would have given him an opportunity to hear from his constituents. Maragua MP Mary Waithira asked Health Executive Joseph Mbai to deliver a message to the governor that the residents were concerned over his failure to attend the celebrations. "Whenever we have celebrations in other constituencies, the ceremony is usually characterised by pomp and colour. I don't know why this sub-county is ignored because the governor did not come. The attendance is very poor despite these being the county celebrations," she said. Murang’a Woman Representative Wanjiru Chege urged leaders to stop unnecessary competitions and serve the residents. "It's unfortunate that the governor and MCAs are not here with us. The MCAs should not be intimidated and should focus on enacting legislation that will guide development,” Ms Chege said.
