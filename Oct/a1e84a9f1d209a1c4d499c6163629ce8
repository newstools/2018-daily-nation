Counterfeit goods valued at Sh8.5 billion have been seized by a multi-agency team from May to October, an official has said. Anti-Counterfeit Agency Chief Executive Officer Elema Halake said as part of the fight against illegal trade, ACA alone has seized counterfeit goods worth Sh1.8 billion with more than 200 suspects facing charges. PROTECT KENYANS Most of the goods seized were household appliances, foodstuff, vehicle spare parts, cooking gas, cigarettes and textiles. Addressing journalists on Thursday at Prideinn Hotel in Diani during a workshop on combating counterfeit goods, Mr Halake said the government under the multi-agency team has heightened the war against counterfeits to protect Kenyans from harm that may arise from using such commodities. "The counterfeit and illicit goods are not only dangerous to people’s health, but also affect the business of local manufacturers," he said, adding that the war will help the country to achieve the Big Four Agenda. He said lot of manufacturing industries are running out of business because of the effect of the influx of counterfeit goods. "We are here to promote and facilitate legitimate trade such that the business taking place in our country is legitimate and products which are going to be sold in our markets are safe for the people and our country," he said. GAS CYLINDERS Energy Regulatory Commission Director-General Pavi Oimeke said they are working with Kenya Bureau of Standards to ensure substandard gas cylinders either imported or manufactured in the country are eliminated. "The government is aware that illicit gas which does not meet the market standards is illegally transported to the country through the porous borders," he said, He told the public to exercise caution when buying gas cylinders and check the expiry date. "Our standards require that a gas cylinder which is more than eight years old must be taken back to the brand owner and revalidated," he said.   Spotlight will likely turn to Kebs and KRA.
