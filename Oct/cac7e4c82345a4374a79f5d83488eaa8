The increasing verbal duels between supporters of Deputy President William Ruto and opposition leader Raila Odinga are degenerating into a veritable farce. If the politicians in the rival camps could listen to themselves, they would realise just how petty and ridiculous they sound. This needless sabre-rattling by people the rest of Kenyans look up to for guidance is, indeed, hurting the statuses of both Mr Ruto and Mr Odinga. The words that have been flying between the two groups are, to say the least, quite beneath the stature of the two men, who have both made distinguished contributions to the country in their long political careers. But the sorry situation is not being helped by the constant sniping at each other by these former allies-turned-bitter foes. The DP’s allies’ insinuation that Mr Odinga is pretending to be a co-president is rather base. But this whole acrimony is, interestingly, a reaction to Mr Odinga’s reconciliation with President Uhuru Kenyatta, which has largely helped to ease the political tension arising from last year’s highly divisive elections. Sadly, the seemingly relentless exchanges between the two leaders’ allies are stoking the dying embers of a fire that had threatened to engulf the entire country. The stark reality, however, is that this fight won’t, in any significant way, change the fortunes of both men, who are firmly rooted in their respective positions. The DP and the former Prime Minister have a firm grip on their respective camps and should encourage mature political competition by reining in their belligerent allies. The greatest folly of our politicians is to permanently engage in election campaign mode. With the next elections nearly four years away, the politicians should give the country a break and channel their energies into tackling the numerous socio-economic challenges the people face.
