A teenage boy who was charged with defiling a four-year-old girl in Voi, Taita Taveta County is in police custody after his family failed to raise Sh50,000 cash bail. The 17-year-old boy was arraigned in a Voi court in early May. In an interview with Nation, his mother raised concerns over her son’s health because the teenager, who is mentally ill according to medical records from the Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi, is also HIV-positive and accessing medical care has been difficult. The mother also criticised police for holding her son in an adult cell. Voi police boss Joseph Chesire confirmed that the minor was being remanded at the police station. “The court directed that he be held here and there is nothing we can do about it,” he said. County Children coordinator Juma Boga said the department was not aware of the case. Mr Boga said the police have not been giving information on the boy yet they have been receiving data from the station on the number of children arrested and detained at the facility. “This is very wrong. The police must avail data of all children detained at the station,” he said. He said he will liaise with the Director of Public Prosecution offices in Voi to know about the status of the case. Resident Magistrate Bernard Onkoba awarded the suspect a cash bail of Sh200,000 when he first appeared before him. But the suspect’s mother sought a review of the bail which was granted by Resident Magistrate Anne Karimi on May 24. Ms Karimi granted the suspect bond of Sh100,000 or a cash bail of Sh50,000, which his mother has been unable to raise nearly three months later.   Pastor arrested in Mombasa where he escaped to after incident was reported.
