A court has temporarily stopped the burial of former Kakamega District Commissioner Paul Yatich's wife, until a case by her relatives is determined. The relatives of Loise Yatich want police to complete investigations into her murder before she is interred. THE ORDER Eldoret Principal Magistrate Naomi Wairimu on Wednesday issued temporary orders restraining Mr Yatich from moving the body from the Moi Teaching and Referral hospital mortuary. “This honourable court restrains the respondents from removing, transporting or in any manner dealing with the body of Loise Yatich until all parties involved are heard on October 30,” ordered the magistrate. Mr Yatich had planned to move the body from morgue on Friday for a funeral on Saturday. Mrs Yatich was found murdered inside her house in Kiplombe estate near Eldoret last Tuesday. She had been working as a curriculum development officer with the Teachers Service Commission in Uasin Gishu County. FAMILY'S CASE Loise's younger sister, Ms Sophie Yegon, turned to court on behalf of the family, seeking the adjournment of the burial. Ms Yegon noted they are not in a hurry as they want the probe completed. She also told the court that Mr Yatich had not informed them of burial arrangements. Two men were charged on October 17 with the murder of Mrs Yatich. Laban Cheruiyot and Simon Lumile were arrested in Kabiyet, Nandi County, after they were found with a vehicle that belonged to her. They did not take plea as the prosecution requested 14 more days to complete investigations.   Police say Loise Yatich was raped before she was killed.
