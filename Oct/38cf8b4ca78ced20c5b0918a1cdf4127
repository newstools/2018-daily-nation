Rongo University students disrupted the burial of Sharon Otieno in Magare village, Homa Bay County, on Friday demanding justice for their slain colleague. The students cut short Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma's speech as they surrounded Ms Otieno's coffin. They prayed for her and her buried foetus chanting, "rest in peace and in power". Mr Kaluma, the family's lawyer, halted the programme for a while to allow the students to grieve. "The journey to fight for justice over Sharon Otieno's murder has just started," he said.   Shouting and wailing, the more than 100 students grieved in their own words and style, eulogising her as a "good comrade". The student leader, Mr Evans Baraza, said they want the perpetrators held to account. "Sharon did not have to die in such a brutal manner, " he said. Dean of Students Ben Asugo told Ms Otieno's family they empathise with them. Ms Melida Auma, Sharon's mother, said they have not yet come to terms with the death of their child. "It has been a very painful moment for us. Very tormenting. I wept when I saw her suspected killers in court," she told the gathering.   The 26-year-old student lived her life on Facebook, constantly keeping her followers updated.
