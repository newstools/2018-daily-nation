The Senate is battling claims of attempts to cover-up its findings in the Sh3.3 billion Ruaraka land saga. This is after questions were raised over delays to conclude the matter, almost three months since the report was tabled. The delay has also sounded alarm bells over the Senate’s role and commitment to defend devolution. CONCLUSION This comes as Homabay Senator Moses Kajwang’, who chairs the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC), which investigated the irregular payment of Sh1.5 billion in January this year to businessman Francis Mburu, officially complained to Speaker Ken Lusaka over the delays. “This letter is to request your office and the Senate Business Committee to schedule debate on this report as a priority. The logical conclusion to a report that has been tabled is for it to be debated and adopted by the members,” Mr Kajwang’ said in the October 22 letter. CULPABLE A section of the CPAIC members have also complained of schemes to frustrate the report. The Senate committee, in its report, found National Lands Commission (NLC) chairman Muhammad Swazuri, officials at the Education ministry led by then Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i and Mr Mburu, among others, culpable for the payment for the 13.7 acre parcel of public land. Mr Mburu claimed ownership of the land LR NO. 7879/4 where two city schools – Ruaraka High School and Drive-Inn Primary School – stand. ACQUISITION However, the payment was questioned prompting the Lands Committee of the National Assembly and CPAIC to lodge investigations into the possible loss of public funds through the compulsory acquisition of the land by the NLC. The report was tabled on August 8, 2018 but debate scheduled for September 20, 2018, failed to take place.   Outcome may jettison investigations, or lead to prosecution.
