Students of Kaimosi Friends University College in Vihiga County on Monday destroyed property in protest against higher tuition. Learners at the four-year old institution engaged police in running battles, threw stones at them and broke windows and their main gate, which was erected recently. NO LEARNING Most classes and offices had broken windows and learning did not take place as the protesters prevented the rest from getting into the school. Police resolved to camp at the institution to keep the protesters away and prevent further damage. County Commissioner John Chelimo said the students also complained about delays in the disbursement of loans from the Higher Education Loans Board (Helb). "That is according to the initial report we got. Helb loans should not have caused unrest as it is not the institution's challenge. The delay has affected institutions across the country," he said, adding they would give more information later. Kaimosi University College is an offshoot of Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology. Principal Jack Nandi was not in his office at the time of the demonstrations and did not respond to a message for comment on the matter. His secretary said he left for Nairobi and that he would address journalists upon arrival. Deputy Principal Maurice Amadalo said he is not authorised to speak to the media.   Recipients who fail to start repaying their loans are listed with credit reference bureaus.
