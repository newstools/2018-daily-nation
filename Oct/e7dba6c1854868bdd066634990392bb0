Dozens of traders in White House estate, Kiti and Mchanga in the outskirts of Nakuru town are counting losses amounting to millions of shillings after a roads authority brought down their premises. The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) demolished kiosks and other buildings on the Nakuru-Nyahururu highway following the expiry of a notice it had issued to the traders about three months ago. The Tuesday evening operation was carried out under the watch of armed policemen. Also destroyed was the White House building. White House estate, in Nakuru, is named after the magnificent building which was build in the 1990s. In the 1990s,the house was decorated with United States flags, painted all white and christened the "White House". The building was once owned by a Kenyan who had lived in the US for many years and who upon returning home in the early 90s, decided to relive the memories by putting up the premises. He chose a serene location, four kilometres from Nakuru town on the Nakuru-Nyahururu highway , where he built the beautiful wooden house and painted it all white. On its wall, the building had the names of all former American presidents. Inside, the building, which housed a bar, was sub-divided into two sections, which represented the two major US political sides: the Republicans and the Democrats.
