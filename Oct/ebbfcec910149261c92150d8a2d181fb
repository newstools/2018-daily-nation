The late Kenneth Matiba was Saturday remembered by his family and his former schoolmates at the Alliance High School as the most ambitious man who fought for the country’s independence. Both the alumni associations of Alliance High School and Alliance Girls met at Matiba’s home in Limuru, Kiambu County, to remember a man whom they all recognised as a pillar of strength. The former students also presented a gift, an Excellence Award and Scholarship Programme in honour of the politician. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed, who graced the function, noted that Mr Matiba’s achievements are recognised nationally, regionally and internationally. WORKING IN GOVERNMENT His widow Edith recounted in an emotional speech how she stood by Mr Matiba during his energetic years working for the government as a minister, during his political life and when he became ill. “It is because of his work and service to this nation that we are able to sit down today and celebrate the life of a man I chose to support till the end,” said Mrs Matiba. She said she hoped the Excellence Award and Scholarship Programme will benefit deserving students. Mr Matiba was an old boy of Alliance High School while Mrs Matiba schooled at Alliance Girls’ High School. Mr Matiba’s son, Raymond, described his father as a man who will be remembered for many years for his determination to impact the lives of many. Alliance High School alumni association chairman Maurice Nduranu said the scholarship programme would go a long way in rewarding students who perform well in academics. “We felt we needed to recognise the efforts of Mr Matiba and decided to launch this programme in honour of the late Matiba,” he said.
