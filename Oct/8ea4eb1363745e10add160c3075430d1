Harambee Starlets have a second chance to participate in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations due in Ghana from November 17 to December 1. This was after Kenya’s protest against the eligibility of six Equatorial Guinea players was upheld by the Confederation of African Football (Caf) Disciplinary Board. Kenya will make their second appearance in the championships, joining hosts Ghana and defending champions Nigeria. The other teams are Algeria, Cameroon, Mali, South Africa and Zambia. The team learnt great lessons in the previous championship in 2016 in Cameroon, where they lost all their pool matches — to Nigeria, Ghana and Mali. They, however, exhibited much potential in women’s football to scale the heights with support from stakeholders. It can be recalled the Starlets used to beat some of their rivals, such as South Africa, many seasons ago. CONSISTENT LEAGUE There is potential, but it needs to be tapped through functional national leagues and sponsorship for the team and training for the players. Even though Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has tried to revive the league, it has not been consistent. Perhaps FKF needs to liaise with the government and sponsors to supplement its efforts to create a robust and consistent league. Participation in the championship gives the sports authorities another opportunity to re-evaluate women’s football and see how best to build it. The Harambee Starlets require equal attention and care as their male counterparts. We hope the government and FKF will put in place programmes to help the girls prepare well for the competition, as the team has less than a month to their first match.
