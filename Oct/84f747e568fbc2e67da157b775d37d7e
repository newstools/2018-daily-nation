Armoured Brigade will Monday square it out with Moi Airbase as Rangers Regiment face off with Eighth Brigade in the opening quarter-final fixtures of the Chief of Defence Forces football tournament at Laikipia Airbase. Armoured Brigade, who topped Pool ‘A’ in the group stage of the football tournament, will kick off their campaign for a place in the tournament’s semi-finals at 9am with a match against Moi Airbase who finished second in Pool ‘C’. At the same time, Eighth Brigade will be looking to pull an upset against unbeaten Rangers Regiment who topped Pool ‘B’ with 10 points, the highest in the competition so far. Rangers have a hard task defensively against an Eighth Brigade team which boasts the most number of goals so far in the tournament with 10 goals so far. In the second round of the quarter-final fixtures planned for 11am, Pool ‘C’ leaders Artillery Brigade will battle it out for a semi-final spot with Kenya Navy Mtongwe. In the other fixture, Kahawa Barrier will take on Engineers. Artillery Brigade were the first team to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Chief of Defence Forces Football Tournament at Laikipia Airbase after convincing wins over Moi Airbase and Second Brigade. Speaking to Nation Sport, Defense Forces Football Association Secretary General Major Edwin Muta has predicted tight fixtures for each team. “We anticipate very tough matches here in the quarter-final matches. We have already witnessed some very competitive games here, and raw talent on display,” Major Muta said. “Note that in case of a draw, the teams will proceed to penalties directly so you can expect some very entertaining 90 minutes in each match,” Major Muta added. The tournament has already witnessed huge upsets, with last year’s finalists Laikipia Airbase, who are also the hosts, and champions Defence Headquarters failing to make it to the last eight of the tournament.
