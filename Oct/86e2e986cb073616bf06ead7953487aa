Police in Kwale County have arrested two suspects and seized three ivory tusks weighing 19 kilograms and have a street value of Sh1.9 million. Msambweni police boss Joseph Chebusit said the two suspects were nabbed at Mvindeni as they were transporting the ivory to unknown destination on a motorbike. He said the officers acted on a tip-off from members of the public and seized the ivory. "Our officers acting on tip off raid an ambush on the suspects at around 1pm and nabbed the three pieces of ivory," he said. Mr Chebusit said they are still hunting for more suspects as they believe there could be more people connected to the seized ivory. â€œWe suspect they are more people involved in this ivory business in the county and we will hunt them down," he said. The suspects are being held at Diani Police Station and will be arraigned in court on Monday.
