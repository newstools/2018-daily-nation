Former World Youth 2,000 metres steeplechase champion, Norah Jeruto, and Josphat Kipchirchir won senior races in the 28th edition of University of Eldoret Cross Country Championships on Saturday. Jeruto, who trains in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet ran a tactical race to time 33 minutes and 43.9 seconds to win senior women’s 10km race ahead of her sister Daisy Jepkemei who timed 34:03.3. Jeruto, a 3,000m steeplechase runner who came third in 2018 Ndalat Gaa Cross Country in Nandi County, said: “We trained well with my sister for the race and I didn’t want her to beat me. I’m happy she managed to come second.” The two sisters are using the cross country series to prepare for the World Cross Country Championships to be held next year in Denmark. Both are targeting places in Team Kenya. Newcomer Kipchirchir won senior men’s 10km race in 30:10:94 and immediately declared interest in gunning for a place in Team Kenya for the 2019 World Cross Country Championships. “We have started the cross country series and I will be looking forward to participating in the Athletics Cross Country series so that I can get a place in the team that will be selected,” said Kipchirchir. Kipchirchir won ahead of Frankiline Ngelel (30:24.8) and Joshua Kiplagat (30:27.3). Bravin Kogei, a Form Two student in Kombatich High School, won junior men’s 8km race in 24:21.2.
