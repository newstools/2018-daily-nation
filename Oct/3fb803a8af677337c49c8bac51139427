The High Court in Kigali has granted bail to Diane Rwigara, a prominent government critic, and her mother Adeline Rwigara. The three-judge panel said the prosecution did not give credible reasons why the pair should be detained during their trial. Diane is facing charges of forgery related to her unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2017 in which she was disqualified. She also faces insurrection charges along with her mother who is also accused of promoting sectarianism. They have been in prison since their arrest in September 2017. The trial will resume hearing on November 7.
