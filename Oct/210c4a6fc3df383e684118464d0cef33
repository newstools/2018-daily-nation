A Siaya ward representative has volunteered to provide lunch to all candidates who will sit for this year's Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) in his ward. South Gem Ward Representative David Onyango Audi said about 900 pupils from 27 primary schools will benefit from the programme that is aimed at enhancing the preparation of the students in the examinations. Addressing the media in Siaya town, Audi said he decided to come up with the programme as part of his contribution to ensure success of the pupils in the national examinations. He said he had set aside Sh100,000 for the lunch programme where each candidate will receive one meal. "The decision to start the programme was made upon realisation that quite a good number of the pupils cannot afford at least two meals a day," he said. The MCA said the programme was expected to be extended to day secondary schools next year and appealed to well-wishers to support the initiative so as to motivate the students to perform well. Audi, who wished all the candidates success during the examinations urged them to ensure they follow the laid down guidelines to avoid being penalised. Siaya County has 26, 067 KCPE candidates who will sit in 686 examination centres.
