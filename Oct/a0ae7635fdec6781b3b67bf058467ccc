Ethiopia national team coach Abraham Mebratu expects Harambee Stars Captain Victor Wanyama to up his first leg performance when the two nations lock horns in the second leg of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Group "F" qualifier at Kasarani stadium on Sunday. The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder received sharp criticism from a section of Kenyan fans after failing to make his presence felt in Bahir Dar on Wednesday as Ethiopia's pair of Gatoch Panom and Shemeles Bekele won the midfield battle. “He (Wanyama) has a very good experience, we are expecting he will play more than he did in Bahir Dar but it will be a difficult match because both teams need the three points,” said Mebratu speaking to journalists before their training session at Kasarani stadium on Saturday. That aside, Mebratu is confident of making amends to pick three points on the road. “We were supposed to win at home but we missed scoring chances, we will correct our mistakes to try play well and get very good result here in Nairobi,” the 48-year-old coach added. Ethiopia arrived in the country on Thursday night. As things stand following Sierra Leone’s suspension by Fifa a fortnight ago, the Walya Antelopes are level on four points with Kenya who boast a better goal difference. The West African nation have to comply to Fifa in good time before the round five qualifiers next month lest they are expunged hence Ethiopia forfeiting their three points gained in the 1-0 win last month. “We didn’t receive any official communication from Caf regarding Sierra Leone situation, we just heard rumours but that’s not our concern, we are focusing on getting three points against Kenya,” offered Mebratu.   With 16 goals for Kenya, Olunga will be the man to watch.
