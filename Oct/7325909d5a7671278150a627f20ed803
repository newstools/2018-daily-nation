It is only school principals, who are also centre managers, who will be allowed to have mobile phones during the administration of the national examinations, Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has said. Ms Mohamed said the phones will be monitored by security officers on a 24-hour basis to get to know which people the head teachers will be communicating with during the period. “We will restrict use of mobile phones to principals alone; supervisors, invigilators and security officers will not have phones in schools during examinations,” said the CS. She said the new regulation is aimed at curbing cheating in the national examinations which start late this month. Ms Mohamed also announced that more schools had been put under surveillance for planning to cheat in the examinations. “Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) chairman, Prof George Magoha, indicated that there are 30 schools under surveillance. We have more schools than the 30 and we will not spare anyone who gets involved in cheating,” she warned. The CS made the remarks at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development after meeting members of the curriculum steering committee. She responded to a claim that she had left critical exam issues to junior officers by saying necessary measures to secure exams were already in place.
