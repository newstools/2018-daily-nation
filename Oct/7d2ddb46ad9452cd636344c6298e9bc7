MANCHESTER Under-pressure Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho saw his side score three goals, including a late winner, as they beat lowly Newcastle 3-2 at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday. Amid newspaper speculation he could be sacked this weekend, Mourinho's side fell 2-0 behind as early as the 10th minute after goals from Kenedy and Yoshinori Muto fired the visitors -- who haven't won in the league this season -- into a shock lead.But Juan Mata pulled a goal back in the 70th minute with a fine free-kick, Anthony Martial equalised six minutes later and Alexis Sanchez scored in the 90th minute to end United's run of four games without a win.
