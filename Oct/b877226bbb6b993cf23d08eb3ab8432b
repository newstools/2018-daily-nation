Hundreds of unsuspecting land buyers in Kajiado risk losing millions of shillings in investments to well-organised con artists. The cartel, comprising elderly locals and some youth, occupy idle land claiming to be squatters. They then set up manyattas and later demand 25 per cent of the property value from the rightful owners, citing historical land injustice to justify their claim. Kajiado West deputy county commissioner William Ngochila said more than five land buying companies and individuals had lodged complaints at his office. “It’s a crime for an individual or a group to invade private land and demand 25 per cent of the land. This is conmanship on the highest order. My office is profiling some of the known suspects to face the full wrath of the law,’’ he said. The victims are mostly Nairobi residents who formed saccos and self-help groups to buy land in Kajiado. Some of the buyers used member’s contribution while others took out loans from financial institutions. Unscrupulous land brokers are also part of the cartel. They target companies, saccos and individuals with large parcels of land that have been paid for in full. The brokers use a vigilante group to keep away the owners prompting negotiations for the 25 per cent of land be hived off the prime part of the property.
