Scientists have developed a new HIV drug available in powder form. The drug, according to researchers, is effective and ideal for children and is in its last stages of formulation. Dr Olawale Salami — the clinical project manager, Paedetric HIV, Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative — said paediatric patients have been neglected for long and this was derailing the fight against HIV. “In as much as mother-to-child transmission has reduced tremendously globally, the infected children have been left out. They cannot swallow the existing drugs and that’s why it is important to come up with the formulation,” Dr Salami said. Dr Salami was speaking Monday during an international conference for researchers. The current drug available for children is in syrup form, which is very bitter. The pellet contains 40 percent alcohol. It is also expensive and requires special storage and transportation considerations. Unpalatable medication has been a hindrance to viral load suppression in children, thereby increasing possibility of children becoming severely ill. However, the powder formulation is safe, easy to administer and heat-stable. The powder is a combination of three currently available HIV paediatric drugs combined with a booster drug.
