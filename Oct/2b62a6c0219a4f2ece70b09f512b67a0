Daniel Muindi Muteti of Machakos Athletics Camp and Uasin Gishu’s Delvine Meringor on Saturday won titles in the 13th edition of Safaricom Madoka Half Marathon at Ngerenyi Farmers Training Centre in Taita Taveta County. Twenty-four year-old Muteti who is preparing to defend his Bucaramaga Half Marathon title in Columbia next week won men’s 21km race in one hour, 06.04 seconds. It was the second time for the Machakos runner to take part in the event, having first competed in the race in 2011 without finishing. Muteti, who has competed in several races in Europe and America, said he did not expect to win yesterday as he was just running to stay in shape to compete in Colombia. “Despite the hot humid conditions, I managed to beat my challengers starting at the 14th kilometer mark,” he said. Muteti was followed by Stephen Mwendwa who returned 1:06.56, with George Njoroge third in 1:06.67. Meringor, 26, won women’s 21km race in 1:16.10. “Winning this event has given me motivation to compete and win in future races,” Meringor said. Meringor, who trains at Kaptagat Camp in Eldoret, said she was using Saturday’s race to prepare for forthcoming Athletics Kenya weekend meetings, and Team Kenya selection ahead of 2019 World Cross Country Championship. Lydia Njeri finished second in 1:18.07, with Esther Chesang third in 1:18.43. Muteti and Meringor will be awarded Sh500,000 each. The race was sponsored by, among others, Kenya Ports Authority, Brookside Dairies, Kenya Revenue Authority and Kenya Commercial Bank. Men’s 21km race: 1.
