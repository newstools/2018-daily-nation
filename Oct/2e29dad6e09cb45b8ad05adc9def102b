Two people were killed after a 14-seater matatu they were traveling in rammed a bus in Lososi on the Chavakali-Kapsabet road Thursday evening. Six passengers, among three students, sustained serious injured and were taken to Vihiga County Referral Hospital. Vihiga Health Chief Officer Dr Arnold Mamadi said two students were later transferred to Kisumu and Kakamega for specialised treatment. One of the students was from St Peter’s Boys in Mumias. He sustained serious head injuries and has been taken to Kisumu’s Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. The other student is from St Teresa, Luereko and was taken to Kakamega County Referral Hospital for ICU care. Dr Mamadi said another student from Butere Girls was treated and discharged. The driver of the matatu that was badly damaged was attempting to overtake another matatu that had stopped to pick a passenger when he rammed into a Modern Coast bus. Mr Clifford Cheptoi, a passenger who escaped unhurt, said he had warned the driver to be carefully but he did not listen. Mr Evans Makori, a witness, said the driver of the matatu was speeding when the crash occurred.
