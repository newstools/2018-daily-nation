Machakos traditional medicine woman Annah Mutheu has been discharged by court after police failed to produce evidence linking her to car theft claims. "Police have not found enough evidence to sustain a criminal case," prosecutor Ms Adeline Rugoto told Nairobi Senior Resident Magistrate Elector Riani when she made the application to drop the case. Ms Rugoto asked the court to refund Ms Mutheu's Sh150,000 bail cash. Detectives raided Ms Mutheu’s home in Tala on Tuesday where they found 112 national identity cards and three “stolen” vehicles. Police said they were acting on a tip-off from members of the public. Following the arrest, Ms Mutheu was released on a cash bail but ordered to report to the police for seven days.
