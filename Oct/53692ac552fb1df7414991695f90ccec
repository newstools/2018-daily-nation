It’s a tragedy that both the government and Football Kenya Federation are yet to embrace the fact that the national football team, Harambee Stars, is close to qualifying for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. The team now needs only four points from their remaining matches — with Ghana and Ethiopia — after Sierra Leone were banned by the world football governing body, Fifa. Harambee Stars meet Ethiopia on Wednesday and Sunday in their Group ‘F’ matches. Beating the northern neighbours over two legs would see Kenya qualify for the premier continental championship, ending a 14-year jinx. However, the emerging sideshows, with the Kenya coach Sebastien Migne threating to quit over unpaid salaries, is sure bad recipe for failure. This comes weeks after some key players also turned down call-ups to the national team for lack of motivation. NO SPONSOR There has been no cohesion in the team’s training. There is no residential training, while locally based players only linked up with their 14 foreign-based colleagues in Ethiopia for the match. Finances have emerged as the biggest threat to Kenya’s plans. FKF has been pointing fingers at the Sports ministry, accusing it of neglecting the team. While this may be true, it begs the question, how come the national team does not have a financial sponsor? And what was the wisdom of acquiring a Sh130 million second-hand outside broadcasting van during such dire financial times? The team is a national asset having multiple sources of revenue will ease the burden on both the government and the federation. Our western rivals, Uganda, are not struggling to get sponsors. In fact, they are spoilt for choice with Airtel, Nile Special, NIC Bank and BUL coming on board. The prevailing state of affairs at Harambee Stars is a national disgrace. It’s simply unacceptable and must be rectified.
