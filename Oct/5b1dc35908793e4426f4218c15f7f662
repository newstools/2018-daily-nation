MADRID Alaves found themselves atop the Spanish league table on Friday after their 1-0 win over Celta Vigo hoisted them ahead of Sevilla and Barcelona in the top three. Alaves have 17 points from nine games with Sevilla on 16 and Barcelona on 15 before they face each other on Saturday. The new leaders are best remembered outside Spain for a run in the old UEFA Cup when they made it to the final in 2001, losing 5-4 to Liverpool in extra-time.
