Over 18,000 participants are set to grace the 16th edition of Standard Chartered Nairobi Marathon that will start and end at the historic Uhuru Park on Sunday. Route director George Kariuki said that preparations for the event that includes five races are complete with an elite field of 80 elite athletes set to battle in the men’s and women’s 42km full marathon and 21km half marathon races. The full marathon starts at 7am, the half marathon at 7:20am and the 21km wheelchair at 6:50am. Participants in these races will start at Uhuru Park’s processional way and make their way down Haile Selassie Avenue while the 10km, CEO and 5km fun races will start along Uhuru Highway. Kariuki noted that those coming to finish the full marathon, half marathon and Wheelchair races will enter through Haile Selassie Avenue while the 10km (8.30am), CEO (7.40am) and Family Run (9.25am) will enter through Kenyatta Avenue (Serena Hotel). Kariuki said that the two finishing points are 150m apart with the media ramp stationed in the middle to enable photographers capture the race finishes with ease. No athlete has ever defended or won the 42km men’s title twice while Alice Chelangat has won the women’s 42km race twice - the inaugural 2003 and in 2012 as she set a course record time of 2:28:04. No woman is yet to defend the title. The scenario is replicated in the half marathon where no athlete has ever won it twice or defended the title. Elgeyo Marakwet’s Brimin Kipkorir and Kapsabet’s Celestine Chepchirchir, who won last year’s men and women races, will not be defending their crowns. The only athlete back to defend her 21km title is Valary Aiyabei, who is fresh from winning the Beijing Marathon in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 04 second in September. Kipkorir clocked 2:12:39 while Celestine Jepchirchir timed 2:31:41 to win last year’s races. Aiyabei timed 1:11:04 for victory in the women’s half marathon as Felix Kibitok went for men’s top honours in 1:03:26. A close affair is expected in men’s marathon where Peter Kosgei is out to recapture the title he won last in 2014 in 2:12:24. Sammy Kipyego, who finished 21st with Cornelius Chepkok, who came in 22nd last year are back keen to atone for their poor show last year. Julius Kipyego Keter, who finished second at the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon last year, Edinburgh Marathon champion Julius Kiplagat Korir and 2012 "Nordea" Riga Marathon champion Titus Kipkorir Kurgat, are also targeting the top prize of Sh 1.5 million. Keter, who is yet to compete this year, won the Mérida Marathon in Mexico in January last year in 2:21:22 before finishing second at Hong Kong Standard Chartered Marathon in 2:10:34 a month later. Emmanuel Kibet, who finished sixth in June’s Lanzhou Marathon in China and Abraham Kipchirchir Limo, who finished second in Verona Marathon in 2016 in Italy and third in Salzburg Marathon last year, will also be in the mix. The 2016 Rock and Roll Madrid marathon fifth place finisher Sylvia Jemeli in a time of 2:44.31 goes for this year’s 42km top honours. Jemeli face among others Naomi Jepkorir, who won the Bank of Jiangsu Nanjing Lishui Half Marathon last month in 1:17.05. Aiyabei braces for a tough battle in her half marathon title defence. The field has 2008 Beijing Olympics 5,000m bronze medallist Sylvia Jebiwot Kibet and seasoned long distance runner Eunice Chebet. Kibet, who won silver in 5,000m at the 2009 Berlin and 2011 Daegu World Championships, is fresh from finishing fourth at Hamburg Marathon in April this year in 2:30:27. She finished second at the same course in 2015 in personal best 2:26:16. Kibet, 34, holds a personal best 1:09:32 in the half marathon from Ostia, Italy in 2015.
