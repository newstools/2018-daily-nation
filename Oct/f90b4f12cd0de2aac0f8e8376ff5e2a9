About 800 students from poor families are set to benefit from full secondary school scholarships at Safaricom's M-Pesa Foundation Academy. The Sh3 billion ultra-modern academy located in Thika was opened on Wednesday by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The academy located in Mang’u opened its doors to the first group of students in 2016. It currently has 487 students. “When we opened the doors to the first cohort of students, it marked the start of the M-Pesa Foundation biggest programme, and probably the one closest to our hearts," said Michael Joseph, M-Pesa Foundation chairman. The academy is a mixed boarding high school and besides preparing students for KCSE, it has redesigned subjects taught so that they are delivered in diverse and excitable ways. Speaking during the event, President Kenyatta said the academy is building a cohesive nation as each county is represented at the institution.   Matiang'i says the school's approach to learning provides the students with an opportunity to discover and nurture their talents.
