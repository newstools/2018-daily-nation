Former Kenya Power Secretary Beatrice Meso and two others have on Tuesday been arraigned over the missing document that stalled a graft case against electricity firm's former bosses. On Monday, the court allowed the case against former Kenya Power officials, among them former managing directors Ben Chumo and his successor Ken Tarus, to be adjourned to give the prosecutor time to probe and find the missing document. State counsel, Mr Alexander Muteti, told the court his case against the officials could not go on since he planned to rely on the original Energy Regulatory Commission report on faulty transformers, which is the missing document. Following the revelation, the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji ordered a probe to establish under what circumstance the key document went missing.
