Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has ordered investigations into fraud claims concerning land said to belong to the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). In a statement on Twitter on Monday, Mr Haji's office said it had learned of fraudulent activities involving Makonza Society, Kamulu Self Help Group, Makonza South and other entities claiming to be the holders of several parcels of land. NO ENGAGEMENT The properties in Machakos County were identified as IR NO.514 (LR. NO 7374), IR 10055/1 (LR NO. 8332), IR NO. 940 (LR 1371/1) and IR NO.15988 (LR NO. 9918/4). Mr Haji said the people behind these organisations particularly operate in Mavoko. "Members of the public are advised not to make any further payments or engage with any of these entities either by themselves, through their agents or proxies," he said. "The land in question is alleged to be the property of ILRI and is therefore unavailable for allocation by and/or to anyone." He asked people who have fallen victim to the alleged fraud to report their cases to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) which will investigate the matter. Complainants are to avail documents concerning their dealings.   The governor wants a review of the commission's importance.
