The biggest criticism of our politicians is their tendency to permanently engage in the pursuit of self-interest and gain. And yet, these are the same people who purport to have been inspired into leadership for public service. Nothing can be further from the truth. They are preoccupied with efforts to entrench themselves in those positions for their own benefit. One can see why the country is always in election mode day and night, throughout the tenures of the Senate, National Assembly and county assemblies. Politicians are driven by an obsession with their own success. Even the management of funds allocated to the constituencies is manipulated to achieve political goals. POLITICAL COMPETITION Sadly, with the daily focus on political competition, programmes meant to improve the lives of the majority suffer. The end of one election immediately ushers in campaigns for the next. Ideally, the leaders should be delivering on their pledges and campaign promises instead of viciously defending their turf and trying to undercut those whom they perceive as their potential opponents. Indeed, the time and terms for the delimitation of boundaries and the procedures used are well-anchored in the law and the IEBC is quite right that this is not the time for it. There are more immediate challenges and needs that the leaders should address to help improve the lives of the voters. Tackling corruption and the current economic difficulties now makes much more sense.
