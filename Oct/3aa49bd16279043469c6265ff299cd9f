United States First Lady Melania Trump has left Kenya for Cairo, Egypt, the final stop in her solo, week-long Africa tour. Mrs Trump left Washington on Monday and began her trip in Ghana and then headed to Malawi. She visited mothers and their newborns in Ghana and a primary school in Malawi.   ACTIVITIES The US First Lady landed in Kenya on Thursday night and was received by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi County. On Friday, they visited the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust’s elephant nursery at Nairobi National Park and later discussed health matters at State House. Mrs Trump and Mrs Kenyatta's talks centred on the welfare of mothers and children and conversation, in line with their Be Best and Beyond Zero campaigns, respectively. The two undertakings “are united under the goal of improving and protecting the well-being of children,” the White House said of their meeting there in August. At that time, President Uhuru Kenyatta met US President Donald Trump. During their discussions at State House, Mrs Kenyatta gave her counterpart a copy of Beyond Zero’s strategic framework for 2018-2022, which she launched earlier in the year.   Mrs Trump also visited the Kenya National Threatre where she and Mrs Kenyatta were treated to cultural performances. President Trump earlier tweeted: "Our country's great First Lady, Melania, is doing really well in Africa. The people love her, and she loves them! It is a beautiful thing to see." Mrs Trump left Kenya early Saturday morning and was seen off by Mrs Kenyatta at the JKIA. The plane departed shortly after 8am, Mrs Trump concluding the longest stay in one country during her maiden tour of the four African countries.   US and Kenyan first ladies hold 'open dialogue' on ' common goals'.
