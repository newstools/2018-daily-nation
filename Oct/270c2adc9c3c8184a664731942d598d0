Premier Lounge is set to 'quench the thirst' of revellers in Karen and its environs. The club, located along Magadi Road at Park Place, opened last Friday in a red carpet affair that was graced by local celebrities like Jalang’o, DJ Pierra Makenna, Fred Omondi and DJ Joe Mfalme. The launch party was a collaboration between the club and Hennessy. Premier Lounge is more than a club. With three bars (two inside and the third being outside), grounds for wedding and party events, a first-floor pool, a VIP lounge area as well as 55 rooms for accomodation, it stands out as one in a class of its own. One doesn’t need to be here just for the clubbing as it’s also ideal for quiet lunches and dinners. The club is fully soundproof. When its doors are fully closed, those at the restaurant and bar outside are completely in a different ambience to those inside the club.   The outdoor bar has a touch of country with barrel tables and high stools, as well as couches made from restored wood items. It’s ideal for drinks under the skylights.  A conference room in the facility can also accommodate 200 people. According to one of the directors, Barbara Kilile, they took over the management of Park Place Hotel, with the accommodation part retaining the original name, while the restaurant and the club are under Premier Lounge brand.   “We wanted to attract people from this side because there’s no club worth mentioning from Galleria all the way to Rongai. People from even as far as Rongai had to go all the way to Kilimani to find reputable clubs to enjoy themselves at, so we wanted to bring this closer to them,” she said. The club’s conception is a year-old although the renovations that went into creating it happened every day for the last two months. The lounge will be having theme days that include guest deejays on Fridays and Saturdays, family days on Sundays that also includes comedians, while Wednesdays will have live bands.
