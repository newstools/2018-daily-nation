Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) enhanced their chances of returning to next season's SportPesa Premier League when they registered a morale boosting 2-0 victory over Coast Stima during a mid-week National Super League match at Mbaraki Sports Club in Mombasa on Wednesday. Dennis Ng’ang’a and Chrispinus Onyango were KCB's marksmen with both goals scored in the first half. KCB head coach Elvis Ayani said he was impressed with the fighting spirit shown by his players. “We are now going to Nairobi for our crucial and important match against Talanta on Sunday and we want to seal our place in the country’s top league prior to our last match against Nairobi Stima. We want to win the game and qualify for the Premier League next season,” he said. The bankers are second on 72 points, five ahead of Nairobi Stima who sit third. A win against Talanta on Sunday will see them seal a return to top flight football after a three-year hiatus. His Coast Stima counterpart Swaleh Kinero blamed poor officiating for their defeat. “I’m not satisfied with the way the whistler handled the match, his decisions favoured our opponents,” said Kinero. The game started at a cracking pace with the visitors making their first attempt on goal in the second minute when Kibwana Shami collected a cross from Kennedy Owino and sent a powerful shot which was brilliantly saved by Stima goalkeeper Ali said. Two minutes later, KCB's Martin Nderitu should have given his team the lead when he was put through by Dennis Gicharu, but his show went wide. In the 37th minute, KCB took the lead when Ng’ang’a sent a free-kick which Ali failed to hold on to. KCB increased their lead a minute to the halftime when an aerial fight for the ball between Onyango and Stima’s Shariff Omar resulted in the latter injuring himself. Onyango dribbled past a defender, before placing the ball home. Omar was rushed to hospital and the extent of his injury is still unclear.
