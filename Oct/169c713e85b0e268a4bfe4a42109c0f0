The Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission (EACC) has written to the Rural Electrification Authority (Rea) demanding nine documents in the probe into corruption claims against the authority’s managers. EACC is investigating procurement irregularities in the awards of tender, installation of solar Photovoltaics and systems in primary schools by the authority. In a letter dated October 2, 2018, EACC asked Rea to "kindly but urgently" furnish them with all board minutes, all board committee minutes, all board members files, quarterly management reports to the board and the solar systems and external and internal audit reports. It also requested for management question to audit queries, initial service purchase orders, list of schools to be electrified on solar, those that have been electrified to date and the authority's payroll. EACC Deputy Director of Investigations Humphrey Mahiva directed the firm to submit the documents to its investigating officers. A report by Rea’s board had implicated the management in corruption.   EACC has for the whole of last week been investigating the management of Rea.
