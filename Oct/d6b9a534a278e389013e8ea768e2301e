Citizen TV journalist Jacque Maribe is fit to stand trial in the Monica Kimani murder case, her lawyer Katwa Kigen has said. Ms Maribe, who is currently being held at Lang’ata Women’s Prison, is accused alongside her fiancé Joseph ‘Jowie’ Irungu in the murder of Ms Kimani in September. Justice Jessie Lesiit this week gave the defence a week for Ms Maribe to undergo a mental test to establish her fitness to stand trial for murder. Her fiancé ‘Jowie’ was also allowed to seek medical attention for treatment of a bullet wound on his chest. The mental test was conducted on Thursday at the Mathari Hospital in Nairobi. The couple is expected back in court on Monday to answer to murder charges against them.   Mr Maribe says police seeking to "become famous" by prosecuting her because she is a celebrity.
