Continental Cup and Africa 3,000m steeplechase champion Beatrice Chepkoech from Kenya is among 10 female athletes who have been nominated for the IAAF Female World Athlete of the Year. Determined to put behind the disappointment from last year’s World Championships in London, where she missed the water barrier, Chepkoech has simply been phenomenal this season. She won the 1,500m race at the National trials, before settling for silver in the metric mile race at Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in a personal best of 4:03.09. Chepkoech went back to her specialty, the 3,000m steeplechase, where she won the National Championships in 9:23.73, before going for the Africa title in a Championship Record time of 8:59.88 on August 5 in Asaba, Nigeria. Chepkoech won four of her five Diamond League races this season with her victory in Monaco on July 20, producing a World Record time of 8:44.32, making her the first woman run under 8 minute and 50 seconds. She shattered Ruth Jebet’s (Bahrain) previous record (8:52.78) by a massive nine seconds. She also won Shanghai (9:07.27), Paris (8:59.36) and Brussels (8:55.10), where she got to claim her first Diamond League Trophy setting the stage for her World Cup victory in 9:07.92 in Ostrava, Czech. According to the IAAF, this week marks the opening of the voting process for the 2018 World Athletes of the Year ahead of the IAAF Athletics Awards 2018 on December 4 in Monaco. The 10 nominees for Female World Athlete of the Year were selected by an international panel of athletics experts, comprising representatives from all six continental areas of the IAAF. Voting for the Female World Athlete of the Year closes on November 12. At the conclusion of the voting process, five men and five women finalists will be announced by the IAAF. A three-way voting process will determine the finalists. The IAAF Council and the IAAF Family will cast their votes by email, while fans can vote online via the IAAF's social media platforms. Individual graphics for each nominee will be posted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram this week; a 'like' on Facebook and Instagram or a retweet on Twitter will count as one vote. The IAAF Council’s vote will count for 50 per cents of the result, while the IAAF Family’s votes and the public votes will each count for 25 per cent of the final result. Chepkoech will battle among others Caster Semenya from South Africa, who won both the 800m and 1,500m at Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast and 400m and 800m titles at Africa Senior Athletics Championships. She went on to win the Continental Cup and Diamond League Series. She was unbeaten in her nine 800m finals including the Commonwealth Games, African Championships, Diamond League final and Continental Cup. The male nominees will be announced on Tuesday.
