A woman who sacrificed her two-year-old son was on Thursday sentenced to three years in probation by the High Court in Nakuru Justice Joel Ngugi handed Beth Njoki the non-custodial sentence after she confessed to have killed her son. THROW IN WELL Njoki, who has been in remand for four years, threw the child in an open well at Muthenji village, Kuresoi within Nakuru County on April 1, 2014. The woman killed the child after she parted ways with her husband following a domestic brawl. She was arrested in 2014.Upon thorough questioning by police, she revealed what happened to the son and led the officers to the scene of crime. The childâ€™s body was retrieved from the well. The investigating officer, who testified in court, said the woman confessed to them that she had met a devil worshipper in Molo, who convinced her to sacrifice the child. She, however, told the court that she had turned a new leaf after receiving salvation and abandoned the cultic religious practices. NON-CUSTODIAL SENTENCE She will now serve the sentence out of custody under the supervision of the probation officers in Nakuru. The judge noted that the four years she has been in remand had served the purpose of the custodial punishment. "The court has considered the context and the surrounding circumstances of the case, and concluded that justice will best be served by the accused being given a non-custodial sentence," ruled Justice Ngugi   How backward traditions are pushing Kenyan women to infanticide
