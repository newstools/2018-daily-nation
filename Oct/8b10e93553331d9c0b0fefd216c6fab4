World Half Marathon record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei and newcomer Kevin Kiptum are the new champions for this year’s Family Bank Half Marathon in Eldoret. The race, which was inaugurated in 2007, has produced a number of world beaters including women’s record holder Jepkosgei. Jepkosgei, who ran a tactical race, broke away from Flomena Cheyech after 16km and led all the way to the tape. “I came to run in the race to encourage the young and upcoming athletes to compete in the local races. I started here before going for the world record and I must say it is a good race to gauge your performance,” said Jepkosgei. Jepkosgei clocked one hour 11 minutes and 01 seconds, ahead of former Commonwealth Marathon champion Cheyech, who came in second after timing 1:11:05, while Antonina Kwambai was in third place after running in 1:11:13. Cheyech on her part said that she was using the race as part of her preparations to participate in Shanghai Marathon in November. “I’m happy I came in second behind the world record holder, though she gave me a hard time and I think I’m in good shape,” said Cheyech. In the men’s category, Kiptum won after clocking 1:02:01 ahead of former Daegu Marathon champion Mathew Kisorio, who ran in 1:02:18, as Wilfred Kimitei came in third after clocking 1:02:31. “I have been training hard to win this race so that I can get international races," said Kiptum. Family Bank chairman Wilfred Kiboro said that they will continue supporting the race. “We have been supporting the race for the last 12 years and our goal is to make it better year after year. We also ask members to always support us and we will be looking forward to more investors coming on board so that we graduate into full marathon and even increase the winner’s prize,” said the chairman.
