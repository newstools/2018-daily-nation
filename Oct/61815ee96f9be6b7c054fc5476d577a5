A court has found Moses Dola guilty of manslaughter in the death of his wife, former NTV journalist Sarah Wambui Kabiru, in 2011. Ms Kabiru was killed in the couple's Umoja estate house in Nairobi County on May 1 that year. NO BOND High Court Judge Roseline Korir made the ruling on Friday and ordered the cancellation of Mr Dola's bond terms. Justice Korir said prosecutors had proved Ms Kabiru died an unlawful death. The judge also ordered prosecutors to prepare a pre-sentencing report ahead of the mention of the case on October 26. The accused will remain in custody until then. Mr Dola had denied committing murder in the trial that began in 2011. That year, the Attorney-General rejected his plea to have the charges reduced to manslaughter, saying there was sufficient evidence to sustain a murder trial. This was after a psychiatrist found him fit for trial.   A journalist accused of killing his wife beat up a warder at the Industrial Area Remand Prison, forcing authorities to put him in his own cell, a court was told on Tuesday.
