Gunshots were fired in the air on Tuesday afternoon at the Kisumu County Assembly after ward representatives caused chaos over adjournment of House sessions by temporary speaker Erick Agolla. Sergeant-At-Arms George Amayo fired in the air after angry MCAs confronted him and accused him of taking away the mace. The MCAs termed the adjournment illegal, arguing that no one moved a motion of adjournment. When the ward representatives turned chaotic Mr Amayo walked into the assembly with police officers. Mr Amayo’s decision to bring police to the chambers angered the MCAs, who booed off the officers. Mr Amayo sought refuge at the sentry box for some minutes and later took to his heels as the MCAs hurled stones at him. He went to the Kisumu Central Police Station to record a statement alongside some MCAs. MCAs who recorded statements included Majority Leader Kennedy Onyango, Majority Whip Gard Olima, Joachim Oketch (Kondele) and Joseph Olale (Nyalenda B). Mr Onyango accused Speaker Onyango Oloo of mismanaging the assembly.   The speakers have been accused of gross misconduct and abuse of office.
