Singer and songwriter Atemi Oyungu, termed the queen of love ballads, is back with a song titled 'Romantic' that features Nameless. Just like she did not disappoint with hits such as 'Bebi bebi', 'Usijali' and 'Moyo', she has impressed with this song. “I had been wondering whether Kenyan men are romantic. I do not want to speak of African men because we all know how our Nigerian brothers are. So I talked to Nameless and he asked 'why not write a song about it?',” she said on NTV's Lit360 show. "I wrote the lyrics and came up with the tune and he liked them. He wrote the bridge and 'Romantic' was made.” Atemi is one of the few respected singers in the country, who dazzles her fans with her unique afro-soul and melodious vocals. Her career as a solo musician started like most – with back-up singing for established artistes such as Eric Wainaina and Tim Rimbui. LONG ROAD What most people do not know is that when Atemi was introduced to the industry, she was in high school. With friends, she formed an all-female a cappella group that only sang in church. Atemi started singing professionally after university. Perseverance through highs and lows has seen her sing for more than 10 years. “I am glad Eric Wainaina found me and that I joined his band as a background vocalist. He is a very good guy ... he helped build songs you wanted to record and told you the producers to work with. It was at that time that my career was shaped." Asked about her advice to artistes, she said: “There is talent but many young musicians do not understand that it simply gets you to the door. Your character keeps things going. Don't overexert your voice because the microphone is supposed to amplify it. If you shout, you will kill your voice."   He wrote more than 2000 songs; his favourite were romantic love, city life and political power.
