LARISSA, GREECE Italian coach Gianluca Festa on Thursday signed a three-year contract with Greek side Larissa, turning down a better deal with the Liberian national team, the mid-table Super League club said. Festa, 49, had joined last month without having signed a contract and has overseen on win and two defeats. Larissa are currently in 10th place in the 16-team standings with six points in as many matches. "Larissa is particularly pleased with this choice of Guanluca Festa since yesterday he received a proposal to take over the Liberian national team with more money than he receives at Larissa but he turned it down," the club said. Festa has previously coached Italian sides Como (2015-2016), Cagliari (2015) and Lumezzane (2012-2013).
