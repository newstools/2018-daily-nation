The death toll in the Fort Ternan bus crash has risen to 50 from the 42 that was initially reported. The bus, belonging to Western Cross Sacco, crashed in an area locals call Tunnel on the Londiani-Muhuroni road on Wednesday morning, with eyewitnesses putting the time of the accident at about 4am. The 67-seater bus is said to have veered off the road while descending a steep slope. The bus then hit a guard rail, rolled over and plunged down about 20 metres, landing on a rocky farm. Kericho County Police Commander James Mogera has said the casualties could rise since more people are still trapped in the wreckage. The injured have been taken to Fort Ternan dispensary and Muhoroni Sub-County Hospital for treatment. Among those who died in the crash are eight children below five years old. An eyewitness, Mr Jackson Koskei, told the Nation that he heard a long hooting sound, then a screech that was followed by a bang and loud screams from passengers.
