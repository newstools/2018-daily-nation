Defending champions Vihiga Queens bagged three points without kicking a ball after Mombasa Olympic failed to honour their Football Kenya Federation (FKF)  Women Premier League match at Mumias Sports Complex on Saturday. The match's fourth official Winnie Were inspected Vihiga players at 12.30pm and thereafter allowed them to go ahead with the mandatory pre-match warm up while waiting for the kick off which was set for 1pm. Vihiga took to the field ready to battle Mombasa Olympic, whom they thrashed 6-1 in the first leg of the 16-team competition in Mombasa. And after waiting for the Coastal team for the mandatory 30 minutes, centre referee Agneta Itubo, in consultation with match commissioner Elias Kuloba, decided to award the match to the hosts. “My players are in top form. They are determined to retain the league title. My wish is to win all the matches in order to be in a good position to retain the title,” Vihiga coach Alex Alumira said. Vihiga players Lillian Adera, Phelistus Kadari, Vivian Nasaka, Cynthia Shilwatso, Corazone Aquino, Terry Engesha and Phoebe Owiti had been lined-up for the match before reporting to Harambee Starlets camp on Monday. The seven comprise part of 32 players summoned by Starlets coach David Ouma to start preparations for the upcoming African Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) tournament set to be held next month in Ghana. In the second match that was played at the same venue, Gaspo Women FC defeated Wadadia 1-0. Gaspo’s Winnie Mugechi scored the solitary goal in the 44th minute.
