After a 14-year absence, the national football team Harambee Stars is on the verge of qualifying for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations following their emphatic victory over Ethiopia. Harambee Stars beat Ghana 1-0 in Nairobi last month and drew 0-0 with Ethiopia away in Bahir Dir on Wednesday to move closer to the Afcon Finals in Cameroon. But the 3-0 victory in Nairobi yesterday took Kenya even closer to confirming a place in Africa’s top national football team competition for the first time since 2004 in Tunisia. Kenya top Group F with seven points, followed by Ethiopia (four) and Ghana (three). Sierra Leone, which was suspended by world football governing body Fifa, is last with three points. LAST MINUTE Yesterday’s victory, helped in part by the government’s decision to waive the entry fee for fans at Moi International Sports Centre - Kasarani, the venue, and a pledge of Sh50 million to the team should it qualify, is commendable. However, that the government only stepped in at the last minute to aid the team’s preparation for the match is testimony that football administrators woke up late to the reality that Harambee Stars were on the verge of qualifying for the Finals. It is embarrassing that the players were fed on promises after their preparations for the first leg match were marred by sideshows. Before travelling for the previous match, Kenya coach Sebastien Migne had threatened to quit over unpaid salaries. Weeks back, some players had turned down call-ups to the team for lack of motivation. It’s awkward that the Stars do not even have an official team bus to ferry players to matches. The government should take the responsibility of funding the team more seriously so as to give them a realistic chance of qualifying for next year’s tournament.
