Kisumu’s main referral hospital now says a review of a woman who claimed doctors left cotton wool in her womb has shown no foreign object was abandoned in her body. Instead, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital says Ms Irene Joyce Oluoch may have been suffering from pain arising from an existing medical condition. CHEST PAINS The hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Peter Okoth said on Thursday that a medical team which re-observed the woman following her complaints found no cotton wool or any other object in her body. Ms Oluoch had complained of severe chest pains, swelling of the body and deteriorating health after a cesarean section birth surgery that was done seven months ago at the referral hospital. “There is no need for surgery because we found nothing in the abdomen warranting her to have an operation,” said Dr Okoth. The hospital boss told Nation the claim Ms Oluoch made may have been influenced by a lumpy feeling she had in her abdomen. Kisumu County Press Secretary Aloice Ager said the medical team at the hospital found that the areas Ms Oluoch felt pain could directly be linked to a condition she has. HEART CONDITION “There is nothing to back up the claims. The team did another scan that showed the patient had an existing heart condition, which the hospital has been managing at no cost,” said Mr Ager. “The patient is free to consult another hospital on the results,” he added. However, the patient’s husband, Mr Bernard Oluoch, said the doctor who attended to her felt something in the abdomen. “This is a mystery. The doctor who gave us the medical results was from Jaramogi Oginga Referral Hospital. He is actually the one who recommended urgent surgery. We had even scheduled for an operation in April, but nothing has come forth to date,” said Mr Oluoch. He said his wife had never had a history of a heart condition as the hospital had mentioned.    Medics’ negligence plunges mother into pain and misery that has lasted seven months.
