A dispute over fish threatens to sour the cordial relations Kenya and China have enjoyed in recent years with increased development co-operation. Now the biggest infrastructure project in Kenya in centuries, the standard gauge railway, built with huge Chinese loans, could be in jeopardy. China is incensed that Kenya has decided to stop importing its fish. The mounting acrimony started the other day, when President Uhuru Kenyatta questioned why Chinese fish had flooded the Kenyan market at the expense of local fishermen and traders. But the President was only echoing public complaints about the imports, some of them illegal. This dispute is sobering confirmation that relations between nations are all about interests. ARM-TWISTED Opening the floodgates of Chinese fish is likely to ruin the market for many Kenyans, denying them a livelihood. Kenyans catch 130,000 tonnes of fish annually. A shortfall of 37,000 tonnes is what importers should plug. The fishing industry supports no less than 100,000 Kenyans directly and nearly 800,000 indirectly. However, the fish issue could just be a manifestation of a deeper problem in the growing unequal ties between the two countries. Indeed, quite alarming is the threat by China to withhold funding for the second phase of the SGR. It is a subtle warning that the more indebted Kenya becomes, the more it risks getting arm-twisted over other interests. This is bound to put the Kenyan leadership in an awkward position as the people have sampled the benefits from the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR and the stalling of the second phase would be a huge setback. It is for this reason that we agree with the politicians calling on the government to reduce its appetite for huge infrastructure development loans and cut its coat according to its cloth.
