A court in Embu has dismissed a petition seeking removal of Governor Martin Wambora in connection to a failed ouster bid four years ago. Justice Florence Muchemi ruled the petition by former Manyatta MP Emilio Kathuri lacked merit since he failed to prove that Mr Wambora was impeached. Mr Kathuri was seeking interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment saying Mr Wambora stood impeached for gross violation of the Constitution. Mr Wambora’s impeachment by the Senate was invalidated by the High Court on the basis that then Speaker Kariuki Mate and Assembly Clerk Jim Kauma, had acted in contempt of court by allowing debate on the motion. Mr Kathuri had pegged his hopes on a Supreme Court judgment early this year which ruled that Mr Kariuki and Mr Kauma were not in contempt. He argued that since Mr Wambora’s impeachment was quashed on the basis of the now annulled contempt of court allegations, the January 16 2014 process stands. However, Justice Muchemi said despite the apex court ruling on the contempt, it did not address other issues that were cited by the High court during the twin impeachment. The judge said the Court of Appeal also nullified an impeachment against the governor on the basis that the county assembly failed to hold public participation forums.
