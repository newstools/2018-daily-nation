At least 40 bodies have so far been recovered after devastating mudslides swept villages in eastern Uganda. The mudslides followed heavy rains that lasted for over four hours on Thursday in Bakalasi Sub County in Bududa District. Bududa District chairman Wilson Watira confirmed the number of mudslide victims, saying the search is still ongoing to rescue trapped people and recover more bodies. “With the help of police and Red Cross officers, we have so far managed to recover 40 bodies of people who were killed in the mudslides. Some of the bodies recovered had missing parts like limbs or heads,” he said. Several survivors have been admitted to Bukalasi Health Centre III with serious injuries.Mr Watira added: “Government has promised to give USh300,000 to each family that lost their relatives to assist in burial arrangements.” However, some residents were heard saying they are fed up of being buried alive by mudslides and the government sending condolence messages. More than 500 people are reported to have also been displaced and are in need of shelter and food, according to the local leaders. The displaced residents, most of them living near a river bank, have sought refuge in nearby schools, churches and trading centres.   Four children among those dead in Bududa foothills of Mount Elgon.
