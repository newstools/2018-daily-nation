Former Youth and Gender Principal Secretary Lilian Omollo on Thursday accused the Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) of misleading the court when it obtained orders to freeze her accounts more than four months ago. Calling for the suspension of the orders, Ms Omollo, through her lawyer Stephen Ligunya, said the authority misled the court when it said Sh900,000 was deposited into four accounts belonging to her and her three children. Mr Ligunya said ARA presented no evidence to the magistrate court which granted the freezing orders or the High Court, which extended them on August 30. NYS Mr Ligunya said 140 days later, the agency is yet to file any report showing how far it has gone with the investigations or what it has found. The lawyer said there were only four transactions in one of the accounts — two deposits and two withdrawals. “It is not true to say Sh900,000 was deposited in the accounts on July 24, 2017,” he said. He added that ARA had not shown or tabled any documents linking the money in the accounts to the National Youth Service. “The applicants have never been summoned by ARA. They were never served with this application,” he said. CHARGED In an affidavit filed in court, ARA says the money was deposited in the four accounts at Equity Bank in one day. The agency’s lawyer Mohammed Adow said more than 300 accounts are being investigated and the progress is slow. The lawyer added that Ms Omollo has not shown where ARA went wrong in obtaining the orders. Ms Omollo, former NYS boss Richard Ndubai and 50 other people have denied abuse of office charges.   5 Ngirita family members still in remand.
