Relegated SportPesa Premier League (SPL) side Wazito coach Frank Ouna has thrown in the towel with reports linking him to the newly promoted Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB). The youthful tactician, who guided the club to earn promotion to the top tier last year, is reported to have sealed a deal with the bankers who sealed a return to the top flight last weekend with caretaker coach Elvis Ayany following the sacking of John Kamau last month. Wazito confirmed the former Harambee Stars assistant coach had resigned with his assistant Ahmed Dmchulla being elevated to head coach. “Our coach Frank Ouna has requested to pursue his coaching career outside the club, the management has reviewed his request and painfully accepted,” read part of the statement posted on the club’s Twitter handle on Saturday. “In the interim, Ahmed Dmchulla 'Moha', will take charge of the team. The management will provide him support to constitute his technical bench and undertake his duties,” the statement further read. Wazito had a decent start in the Premier League before financial instability contributed to the mass exodus of its key players in the June transfer window, something Ouna admitted turned tables in quest for survival. After 34 rounds, Wazito managed 31 points coming from eight wins and seven draws as they finished second from bottom on the 18-team table.
