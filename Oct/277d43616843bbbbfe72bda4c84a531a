Nineteen players have been selected for trials with Kenya Premier League side Ulinzi Stars as Kahawa Garrison clinched the Chief of Defence Forces football tournament title at Laikipia Air Base on Friday. Former Ulinzi Coach Benjamin Nyangweso led Kahawa to a 2-1 victory over Armoured Brigade in the CDF final. Nyangweso’s side took the lead in the 26th minute through a penalty for a foul in the box. Stephen Makau capitalised on the open chance to put his spot kick past Armoured Brigade keeper. Armoured Brigade staged a comeback with a close range shot from a corner in the 80th minute but eight minutes later, Marcus Mukolwe grabbed the winner with a lobbed header over the gunners’ defence. Multiple attempts by Armoured Brigade to get an equaliser in the dying minutes of the game only ran into a tight defence by the Kahawa boys. Ulinzi Stars Coach Dunstan Nyaudo, who watched the match from the side lines, picked 19 players from the tournament with the hope of signing a few for the upcoming season. The players will join the KPL side for build-up matches and Nyaudo is optimistic to sign a few of the scouted talent before the beginning of the new season in December. “There is raw talent and we will bring them on for our build up matches and see what they can add to the team,” he said.The Ulinzi boss lauded tournament debutant Eighth Brigade from where he picked several players for trials. “They have a very beautiful style and such raw talent," he said. Champions Kahawa Garrison will host 2019 CDF tourney.   Last year’s finalists Laikipia Airbase and Defence Headquarters were bundled out.
