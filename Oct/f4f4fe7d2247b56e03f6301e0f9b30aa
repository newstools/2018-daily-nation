Champions Vihiga Queens showed little respect for Thika Queens thrashing them 4-0 in a top of the table Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Women Premier League (WPL) clash at the Mumias Sports Complex on Sunday. Marceline Odinga, Phelistus Kadari, Phoebe Owiti and Topister Situma scored a goal apiece to sink the three-time champions. The victory saw Vihiga Queens open a six-point gap at the top with 51 points from 19 matches. Thika Queens remain second in the 16-team league with 45 points after 18 matches. Vihiga coach Alex Alumira was overwhelmed by his side's near perfect display. “The girls actually put in their best. They were in good mood and above all they followed my instructions to the letter,” he said. His opposite number Benta Akinyi, who masterminded a 2-1 win in the first leg, rued the missed chances which ultimately proved costly. “We controlled the better part of the first half, but unfortunately we did not score. The defeat will not kill our quest to reclaim the league title as we are determined to fight to the end,” she noted. The hosts went ahead four minutes into the encounter against the run of play when Oginga capitalized on a defensive blunder from Wincate Kaari to find the roof of the net with a drive that gave Monicah Karambu no chance. Thika Queens were the brighter of the two sides in the opening exchanges and Harambee Starlets forward Mwanahalima "Dogo" Adam should have crowned their early dominance with a goal on 21 minutes but her shot from the edge of the box was parried by Samantha Akinyi. Vihiga found their way back to the game and won a penalty after Nelly Sawe fouled Owiti in the box. Kadari made no mistake from the spot to double her side's lead in the 27th minute. Owiti, a constant menace to Thka Queens, got on the score sheet in the 59th minute with a screamer before Situma completed the rout with a solid header ten minutes later. In an earlier match at the same venue, Wadadia held Vihiga Leeds to a 3-3 draw.
