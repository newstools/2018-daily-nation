The University of Nairobi’s Mean Machine are the inaugural Varsity League champions. Fullback Trevor Arina slotted over a curling penalty as Machine downed Blak Blad from Kenya University 15-12 to lift the trophy in a thrilling final at the University of Nairobi grounds. Blak Blad stormed into a lead 3-0 when fly-half Lionel Ajelit scored one of his three penalties but eighthman Aaron Otieno landed from a maul to put Machine ahead 5-3. Then Ajelit would chalk a drop goal followed by a penalty as Blad Blad, who are the Kenya Universities champions, took a 9-5 lead at the drinks. The see-saw affair saw Machine awarded a penalty try for a 12-9 lead. Ajelit’s third penalty levelled matters for Blak Blad before Arina’s exploits handed Machine victory at home. Egerton University crushed Catholic University of East Africa 20-0 after leading 13-0 at the break to finish third. Flanker Bramwel Omwago and fly-half Felix Oloo scored a try each before winger Brian Ndege curled over a penalty for Egerton’s 13-0 lead at the break. Omwago completed his brace as scrum-half Stanley Maina converted to put Egerton beyond reach. It was double victory for Machine when their other team handed United States International University (USIU) a 12-8 defeat to win the Varsity category at the Impala Floodlit tournament on Saturday. Skipper Shedon Munoko, who was declared the Most Valuable Player at Floodlit with a total of eight tries, scored a try in the final against USIU. Charles Kinyanjui added another try that Eric Muthama converted for victory.
