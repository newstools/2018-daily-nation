The Environment Court in Nakuru has allowed the State time to counter forgery claims in the purchase of 750-acre parcel for resettlement of the internally displaced people. Justice Dalmas Ohungo granted an application by the government seeking 21 days to file response to the report by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, confirming forgery of signatures by the seller of the land in Subukia. In the case that was filed in 2010, nine sisters claiming ownership of land want its purchase revoked. The women's lawyer Steve Biko Osur said his clients did not give consent to the sale of land by their brother Philip Kamau Ndun’gu who was the administrator of their late father’s estate property.
