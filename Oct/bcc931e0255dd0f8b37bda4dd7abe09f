A post-mortem report of a tout who died under mysterious circumstances in a Mombasa police stations last month is out. The examination done by Government Pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor, Prof Emily Adhiambo, Dr Muramba Irene and Dr Ngali Mbuuko shows that Mr Caleb Ospino suffered multiple injuries on his head, neck and chest. Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) director Khalef Khelef said the organisation will conduct their independent investigations with the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and Independent Medico Legal Unit (IMLU) to rule out any foul play. Mr Khelef insisted that the late Ospino was arrested and injured in police custody. “The role of the police is to protect and maintain law and order. They have exhibited laxity and bad faith in this issue. If there is a police officer on the wrong, he should face the law” Mr Khelef said. Mr Mohamed Mwalimu, an official from IMLU said they want the individuals involved in the death be suspended from duty. He also called on the Director of Public Prosecutions to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. The victim’s family said they were satisfied with the postmortem results. “We are now aware that Ospino sustained injuries that led to his death. We are sad about this because he died in the hands of those who are supposed to protect him, ” Patrick Okuyosi, an uncle of the victim, said. Changamwe police boss Peter Omanwa has denied claims that the victim died in police custody. Mr Omanwa claimed victim was pronounced dead on arrival at the Coast Provincial General Hospital. IPOA, IMLU, Muhuri and the Commission for Human Rights and Justice are some of the organisations that have launched independent investigations into the case.
