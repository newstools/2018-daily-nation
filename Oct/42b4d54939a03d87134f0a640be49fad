Four suspects have been arrested in connection to the murder of a 65-year old woman on Tuesday night. Ms Alice Muthoni, a resident of Gathanji village in Ol Moran, Laikipia County, was shot dead by suspected cattle rustlers. HOME RAID Ms Muthoni was reportedly killed by bandits who raided her home when she tried to raise the alarm “Three armed men raided her home at around 9 pm and attempted to steal her two cows. She was shot three times in the stomach after she tried to raise alarm,” said Mr Benson Kamara, a villager. He said bandits have carried out several attacks in the area and stolen an unknown number of livestock. Another resident said: “We are now living in fear as this is the third case in a week." County Police Commander Simon Kipkeu said the suspects were detained at Ol Moran Police Station for questioning. Local leaders have demanded the deployment of more police officers to the area. Sossian Ward Representative Jacob Edung noted that the attacks may interrupt the national primary and secondary school examinations. "Parents have started fleeing with their children for fear of being attacked. This is likely to affect the performance of KCPE and KCSE candidates,” he said and demanded government intervention.   Among the dead is a driver and a Nyahururu-based forester.
