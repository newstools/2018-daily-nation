Kenyan champions Gor Mahia continued their hunt for top players by roping in Kariobangi Sharks defender Pascal Ogweno and Zoo Kericho striker Nicholas Kipkirui on Friday. Gor Chief Executive Officer Lodvick Aduda confirmed that Ogweno and Kipkirui, put pen-to-paper to three and four year deals respectively. Aduda believes Kipkirui will be a good addition to the Gor Mahia striking force if the 13 goals he scored for Zoo during the just concluded season is anything to go by. “We have just captured Kipkirui who we believe is a top striker and will be a great addition to our striking force. We wish him the best of luck as he joins a team of several other talented stars,” Aduda said. Ogweno joins the champions on the Bosman rule after he was released by Sharks two months before his contract lapsed. The duo joins Kenneth Muguna and Shafik Batambuze who already reported to training on Thursday. K’Ogalo are reportedly in pursuit of Bandari winger Abdallah Hassan. “I am flying to Mombasa to seal another deal with a top player whose name I cannot reveal now and should be able to make an official announcement by mid-day,” hinted Aduda. He further added that technical bench has already identified players who will either be dropped or sent on loan but this would be made public at a later date. Gor resumed training on Thursday ahead of their trip to the United Kingdom to play English Premier League outfit Everton on November 6.
