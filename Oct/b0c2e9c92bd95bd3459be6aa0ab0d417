A bus conductor has been fined Sh100, 000 or serve two years imprisonment in default for contravening the law banning the use of plastic bags by a Kwale Court. The Tawakal Bus Company crew member, Mbwana Mohammed Mzee, who paid the fine, pleaded guilty to the charge before Senior Resident Magistrate Mr. Patrick Wambugu, who convicted him. Mzee told the court that he was unaware that the parcel he was given to load onto the bus comprised plastic bags. “I am a conductor and only found the parcel I was given was polythene paper at the border point when police inspected the bus. I can pay the fine,” he said. While sentencing Mzee, the Magistrate said: “I understand that these items are banned and smuggling them back will not help this country.” However, his co-accused, a businessman, Alividza Isaiah, denied the charge of being in illegal possession of 3,180 bundles each with 100 pieces of the outlawed bags valued at Sh159,000. He was released on a Sh500,000 bond and a surety of a similar amount and his case fixed for hearing on January 7, next year. The two were arrested at the Lunga Lunga border point while ferrying the illegal consignment in the bus which was traveling from Tanzania to Kenya. They were charged that on October 23 at Horo Horo in Lunga Lunga, Kwale County, they were found in illegal possession of plastic bags.
