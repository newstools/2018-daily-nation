Brian Kassaine, one of the suspects questioned over the murder of Monica Kimani, whose body was found in a bathtub at her house in Kilimani, has been released. But Mr Kassaine, who was arrested 13 days ago, will be required to report to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) every Thursday for the next two months. Lead investigator Maxwell Otieno said Mr Kassaine was still being investigated in connection with the murder. TV Journalist Jacque Maribe and her fianc√© Joseph Irungu will be produced in court on Monday after they were ordered to be remanded until Ms Maribe undergoes a mandatory mental test. Detectives investigating the matter applied to have Mr Kassaine released with the condition that he appears before them twice every week to facilitate further investigations. But the suspect, through his lawyer Kefa Ojijo, objected to the application, arguing that he should be released unconditionally. According to Mr Ojijo, the suspect has not in any way been linked to the murder. But Kiambu Principal Magistrate Justus Kituku directed that Mr Kassaine appears before the DCI every Thursday for next two months. He has also directed the he deposits his passport with the police within the next 48 hours.   It is likely that detectives have used his evidence to tie the two to the crime and its attempted cover up
