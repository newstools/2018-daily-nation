Citizen Television journalist Jacqueline Maribe has been freed while her co-accused Joseph Irungu will stay in remand after being denied bail. The High Court denied Mr Irungu's request for bail in the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani, with Justice James Wakiaga ruling that he is a flight risk and has access to weapons that can intimidate witnesses. "A picture that emerges from the prosecution's evidence as set out herein above and the pre-bail report of the accused is that he is a male version of a slay queen, which for lack of better terminology I'd call a woman eater," said the judge as he rejected Mr Irungu's bail application. However, Justice Wakiaga released Ms Maribe on Sh1 million cash bail or a Sh2 million bond with a surety of the same amount. The judge said the prosecution failed to table before him compelling reasons to deny Ms Maribe her freedom. The court asked the TV journalist not to contact any of the witnesses, either directly or indirectly. In addition, Ms Maribe will also accompany investigators to her house in Lang'ata, Nairobi, so they can make an inventory or gather any evidence they haven't got. Thereafter, they will allow her to use the house. Justice Wakiaga also barred Ms Maribe from reading news or interviewing any person related to the case during the trial period but the order will be reviewed regularly. Their murder case will be heard on June 18, 2019.   Prosecution wants Jacque Maribe ordered off TV screens as she might intimidate witnesses.
