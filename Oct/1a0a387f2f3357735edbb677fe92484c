Internet Solutions (IS), formerly Access Kenya Group, has unveiled consumption-based billing for businesses as opposed to the fixed costing following the conclusion of a pilot programme. The billing service dubbed IS Open Network will see businesses pay as per their usage, which the firm reckons will cut down on extra costs Kenyan companies incur during downtime and off-peak seasons. Managing director Richard Hechle said the disruptive solution would offer businesses better flexibility and control over their expenses. “With this new service, our clients will be given an open pipe and can utilise as much bandwidth as they like and only pay for what they have used at the end of the month,” he said. Mr Hechle said during the piloting of the product it had been clear that most companies in emerging markets were keen on consuming the Internet as a utility, like electricity and water, where they are only charged for what they use monthly. The new consumption-based service is now available in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Nigeria and Ghana. Businesses will be able to set limits depending on how much they would like to consume without contacting the IS support team. Customers will also be allowed to pick from four available speed options including 20Mbps, 50Mbps, 100Mbps and 155Mbps. The launch of the solution comes in the wake of an increase in demand for bandwidth in Kenya as needs of businesses evolve. For instance, many companies use video-based training and communications technologies such as Skype for meetings. Mr Hechle said the primary objective the solution is not pricing but rather to offer customers better experience through resolving technical issues. He also said IS plans to roll out non-connectivity enterprise solutions as it seeks to grow its market share and revenue.   Internet Solutions (IS), formerly Access Kenya Group, will offer consumption-based billing for businesses as opposed to the traditional fixed billing.
