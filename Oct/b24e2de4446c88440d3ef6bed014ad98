A 24-year-old patient said to be mentally disturbed has committed suicide using a bed sheet inside the psychiatric ward at Embu Level Five Hospital. The lifeless body of Mr Martin Njeru was found dangling from the window grills by a nurse doing rounds at around noon on Sunday. Embu West DCIO George Etyang said the patient had been taken to the hospital on Wednesday after his condition deteriorated and was admitted. “The patient had been rushed to the hospital by his parents two days ago where the health workers advised that he be admitted. He was being attended to and had been given medication to calm him and was under observation. “As one of the nurses was going to monitor his progress, he found him having taken his life with a piece of cloth. The nurse reported the matter and police were called in,” he said. Mr Etyang said scene of crime officers had visited the hospital for documentation and removed the body to the hospital’s mortuary as investigation started.
