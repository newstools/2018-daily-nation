President Uhuru Kenyatta has signed into law Sh47.25 billion supplementary budget, with the lion's share of the funds allocated for his affordable housing agenda. The Supplementary Appropriation Bill No. 2 of 2018, was presented to President Kenyatta for signing by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. The allocations in the new law reflect a significant reduction from what was allocated in the last financial year, which is in line with the ongoing austerity measures aimed at cutting down government expenditure. The Housing department is set to receive Sh21 billion to effect one of Mr Kenyatta's Big 4 agenda, to provide affordable housing. Other beneficiaries include the Judiciary which will get Sh1.5 billion and Public Works ministry with Sh1.9 billion. Chief Justice David Maraga had previously complained over the slashing of the Judiciary's development budget. The Bill signed by President Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi also allocatesÂ  Sh2 billion to for promotion of tourism programmes and Sh873 million to the Wildlife department.
