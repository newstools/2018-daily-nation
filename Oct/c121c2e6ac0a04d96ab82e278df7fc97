A Nandi County finance department employee was found dead in a hotel room in Eldoret on Wednesday. The woman checked in at Venus Inn Hotel on Tuesday around 6pm but her room remained locked until Wednesday afternoon. Hotel workers called the police who broke in and found her body in bed. Police said she could have committed suicide as a packet of poison was found on the table. Eldoret South police boss Wilson Abduba Waqo said investigation into the incident is ongoing. Mr Waqo said the woman was identified by her relatives and her body was taken to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary.
