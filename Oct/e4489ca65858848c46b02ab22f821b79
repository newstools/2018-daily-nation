While gaming desktops don’t come cheap, laptops always leave a hole in the pocket, a factor that does not deter serious gamers in Kenya, who don’t bat an eye at the ridiculously high hardware prices in the market. The new Razer Blade 15 has a near Sh200,000 asking price. It sits on a black aluminium chassis just as previous models, so in that respect hasn’t changed. It comes with an Intel eight-generation i7 6-core processor backed by 16GB RAM and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 video card. NOTABLE CUT-DOWN The unit will come with a single-zone RGB keyboard that will still react to Chroma standard for immersive in-game lighting effects, with the cut-down being that selective output on the keyboard is not an option. That is the first notable cut-down. The display is next to get the chop, with the screen being limited to 1080p 60Hz against other options such as 1080p 144Hz and 4K 60Hz, though if you are able, they will be available on upgrade. Also chopped is the storage, with options being a single 128GB Solid State Drive (SSD) with a 1TB Mechanical Drive, or a 256GB SSD with a 2TB Mechanical Drive against a single SSD. Even the logo at the back gets chopped with a non-illuminated option. Asking price for this “budget” gaming laptop? Around Sh160,000. These are currently shipping globally, and appetite for them is quite high so don’t be surprised if you wait for yours for over a month.
