Hi Brenda,I am my wits end. My husband wants to vie for a political seat in 2022 and has asked me to move to shags even though I enjoy my work here in the city and I have really started growing. Even my bosses think I am a prime candidate for a promotion. The problem is that he is the main breadwinner and also quite a dictator so disagreeing with him could mean an end to my marriage. Please help me. Hi,That is tricky! You clearly don't want to move, but you also don't want to lose out on the progress you've made at your job. Is your husband willing to reach some sort of compromise – seeing as that is what marriage is supposed to be about? Can you come to the village on the weekends, and continue working at home? Surely your dreams don't have to be put on hold for his dream alone, and he's being a bit of a bully because of his economic power, which is just mean. Ask yourself, if when put on the line, which one you would pick. Then go with the compromising option that's closest. If you're going to be miserable without your husband but happy with your job, consider that before you move completely. If you'll be miserable with your job but excited to be by your husband's side on the campaign trail and inevitably want to end up with him, then you know what to do. Regardless of what choice you make, it is time to have some sort of conversation on why he lords money over you, and how important your career is to you as well. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
