Three-year-old twins have died in a mysterious fire in Chorong’i, Nyeri County. The cause of the Monday afternoon fire could not be immediately established even as locals blame fire fighters of slow response. Nation established that the two children had been left in the house alone by their parents. The fire broke out at around 2pm moments after the mother left the children having lunch alone in the house. Neighbours said that that they only noticed smoke rising from the house as the fire spread rapidly. HUGE SMOKE “We just saw a huge smoke and rushed to find the house on fire. The heat was too much so there was very little we could do,” one of the locals said. Confusion hindered rescue operations as some rushed to use soil and water to try and contain the fire. County firefighters claimed that they were directed to the wrong village. The fire fighters initially rushed to Ruring’u, more than three kilometres from the actual scene of the fire, and had to re-route to get to the burning house, losing critical time in the rescue operation. HOUSE INACCESSIBLE The situation was worsened by inaccessibility to the house as the fire fighters were forced to leave their truck on the road as they pulled water hoses to the fire scene. The desperate situation angered the residents who turned their anger on the firefighting crew, accusing them of incompetence. But the firefighters stood their ground, insisting that they had responded swiftly.
