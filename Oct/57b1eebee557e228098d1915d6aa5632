The police are once again in the news for the wrong reasons. This should concern the National Police Service, which has in the recent past made commendable efforts to clean up its image. True, the police do a generally commendable job in difficult circumstances and deserve praise for that. They, in many instances, put their lives on the line to protect fellow Kenyans. But there are a few rotten eggs pulling their honest and hardworking colleagues backwards. When the word ‘force’ was dropped and replaced with ‘service’ in the official name of the police, it was deliberately meant to show a commitment to live up to is motto of Utumishi kwa Wote (Service to All’). This made sense as the police tried to repair a battered image as a result of the devious activities of a few, who had turned the unit into a repressive, brutal, corrupt, inept and deadly outfit. CRIME It is, therefore, disappointing that the NPS could be drifting back to its ugly past. In Nairobi in the past few weeks, a gang of serving and past officers, working in cahoots with some wayward former soldiers, has been terrorising residents, robbing and kidnapping them for ransom. Styling itself as a part of the Flying Squad, this gang has caused untold suffering to innocent people. Fortunately, some have been arrested by the real Flying Squad and others are on the run. And at the coast, there is a public outcry over the increasing number of police killings of suspects and innocent people, including schoolchildren. Five such recent incidents are being investigated. The rogue police and their collaborators must not be allowed to roam the country and terrorise law-abiding fellow Kenyans. They must be flushed out and punished.
