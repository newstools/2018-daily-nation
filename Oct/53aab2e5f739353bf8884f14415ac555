Some eight persons implicated in the Sh468 million scandal at the National Youth Service (NYS) will be state witnesses. The eight include Sammy Muchuki, Rodgers Nzioka, Josephat Njoroge, Stephen Riungu and Lucas Otieno. REVISIONS Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) Noordin Haji agreed to the suspects' request to be state witnesses as the trial begins so the court discharged them. In the case now are 36 individuals and companies. The prosecution has revised the amount of funds lost in corrupt deals at the NYS from Sh468m to Sh8 billion but the suspects in court on Monday faced charges concerning the loss of Sh468 million. All the accused persons took plea in the consolidated NYS 2 corruption case and the court allowed the Director of Public Prosecution to include new charges on proceeds of crime and money laundering that were not in the charge sheet. The court was adjourned to October 31 to allow disclosure of expert witness statements and evidence of those who turned into state witnesses. This will also allow the defence to seek instructions from clients on the additional charges.   So far, some 51 suspects have been charged with the loss of money.
