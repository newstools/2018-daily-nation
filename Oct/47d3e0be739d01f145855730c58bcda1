Police in Migori County are investigating the mysterious death of a Fourth Year student at Rongo University. The body of Kelvin Ngui, who was pursuing a degree in Tourism and Hospitality, was found next to a river nearly a month after he disappeared from the Migori campus. His decomposing body was found next to River Kuja, which is about two kilometers from the campus. Rongo police boss Kibet Kirui said although the body was found near the river but the student "did not die of drowning" “Investigation into the student’s death is underway and we hope a post-mortem will reveal how he died," said Mr Kirui. The university has been in limelight in recent days following the murder Sharon Otieno in September. Ms Otieno was a second year student at the institution. Migori Governor Okoth Obado and his two aides, Caspal Obiero and Michael Oyamo, were charged with the murder. They denied any wrong doing and they are currently remanded pending their bail application hearing on October 24. Rongo University Vice Chancellor Samuel Gudu said the death of the student shocked the institution’s community which is still coming to grips with the death of their other student Ms Otieno. Students of the institution have in the past raised concerns over rising cases of insecurity in the university and its environs. Mr Gudu, however, maintained the institution has put measures in place to ensure the security and safety of students in the campus.
