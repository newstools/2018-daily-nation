The complainants in a case in which a Catholic priest from Githunguri, Kiambu County, is being investigated for allegedly preying on female parishioners are yet to testify. The priest was suspended pending investigations by a tribunal. A man whose daughter is said to be a victim told the Nation that, despite having been promised that he would be given an opportunity to present his case before the tribunal, this has not been done. IMPREGNATED His daughter is reported to have procured an abortion, allegedly with the help of the priest, who was serving in the Kiambaa Parish, after he impregnated her. “I received a call from Nairobi (Archdiocese of Nairobi headquarters) informing me that I would be given an opportunity to present my case against the priest, but I am yet to get the chance, although I am aware that the parish leadership has, appeared before the tribunal,” said the man, who said it was a painful experience. He said he hopes the investigations will be expedited so that the truth can be established. TRIBUNAL According to sources, those who have appeared before the tribunal include the parish committee and a few parishioners who hold positions in the church. Before the matter was exposed by the Nation, there were efforts by, among other people, elders and some church members, to cover it up, saying it would add shame to a church that is battling claims that some of its priests are sex pests. The youthful priest has been accused of impropriety by luring young women, including Form Four students, to his house.   The cleric serving at Kambaa in Kiambu reportedly lured the teens to his residence.
