Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has been criticised for attending the homecoming party of businessman Don Bosco Gichana who had been imprisoned in Tanzania for money laundering. Former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile said the Wiper leader should not associate with people who have committed economic crimes at a time when the country was fighting corruption. He said even opposition leader Raila Odinga, who is Mr Gichana’s friend, did not attend the function as he was aware of the political implications. Mr Gichana gifted Mr Odinga with a hummer vehicle in the run up to the 2007 elections. WAR ON CORRUPTION Mr Ndile said Mr Musyoka should not 'sit on the fence' in the ongoing war on corruption. He pointed out that Mr Musyoka had publicly supported Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu who has been charged in court. Mr Ndile urged Mr Musyoka to stay away from people charged with corruption if he is serious about his 2022 presidential ambition. "In 2022 Kenyans will elect a person of integrity. If Musyoka were to be elected president, would he influence the outcomes of court cases facing his friends?” posed Mr Ndile. CHANGE CONSTITUTION The former Kibwezi legislator also supported a change of the Constitution to reduce the national wage bill. "Parliament is overcrowded. We have a problem of bloated wage bill. Even counties are overstaffed, we should also do away with MPs and MCAs’ sitting allowances," said Mr Ndile. He added that elected leaders should not be paid sitting allowances for doing jobs they were elected to do.   The flamboyant politician Don Bosco Gichana was recently released after a 5-year detention in Tanzania.
