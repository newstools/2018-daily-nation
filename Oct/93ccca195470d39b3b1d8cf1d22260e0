A huge appetite for domestic and international travel by members of county assemblies is a big blot on devolution, a system that has otherwise being lauded for its impact on grassroots development. It’s a pity that despite a public outcry over the so-called ‘’benchmarking” trips, the scourge festers. RAMIFICATIONS According to the Controller of Budget Implementation report for the financial year 2017/18, local and international travel gobbled up Sh1.3 billion. And the MCAs pocketed Sh133 million in allowances. It’s a racket, whose ramifications have been felt overseas, too, with some countries, most likely concerned about the looting of aid, denying MCAs visas. DIFFERENCE The orgy of lavish spending has seen some 12 counties in the Mt Kenya and northeastern regions splash a whopping Sh2.4 billion on travel. And the matter has been compounded by reports of the MCA fleecing the public using fictitious claims. As the politicians roam the world purportedly to learn from others how they tackle their problems, there are pressing needs in their counties that are denied funds that could make a huge difference. SIMULATED But the travel bug has also not spared senators and MPs. This is a conduit for the wastage of public funds that needs to be plugged. Indeed, there is hardly any proof that the numerous trips have added any value to the country. There is no evidence of any senators, MPs or MCAs returning from such “benchmarking” trips and initiating projects to improve their people’s lives. As we have argued before, in these days of high-tech communication, these learning can be simulated or virtual visits set up to enable the people to view real time what happens in other countries. The county and national governments must clamp down on the junkets.
