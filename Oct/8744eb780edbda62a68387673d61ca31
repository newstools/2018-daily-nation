Two exam centre managers in Meru were arrested on Tuedsay for going to work while drunk and failing to collect examination papers on time. Meru County Commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga said the two KCPE centre managers were immediately substituted to ensure the examinations continued as planned. In Igembe Central, a centre manager is said to have failed to turn up at the sub-county headquarters to collect the papers forcing officials to deliver the exams to Karama Antuamuo Primary School. “The centre managers are contracted by the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) to ensure the exams are done. Any attempt to sabotage the examinations will not be entertained. Students have prepared for the exams for many years and all officers must take this exercise seriously,” Mr Nyagwanga said. He said the team overseeing the national exams is on high alert to avert irregularities.
