ODM leader Raila Odinga says referendum on change of 2010 Constitution is inevitable. Mr Odinga on Thursday said "no one can stop an idea whose time has come" as he reaffirmed that Kenya will hold the plebiscite at an opportune time. Speaking in Rongo, Migori County, during the campaigns for the party Senate candidate Ochillo Ayacko, Mr Odinga dismissed critics of the referendum "as cries of a frog that will not stop cattle from drinking water." "The Building Bridges taskforce has begun work and they will move around the country to collect views from Kenyans. We want to fix our problems once and for all," he said. He explained that his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta is meant to address long-term issues that have affected socio-economic development for decades. Mr Odinga said the party handpicked Mr Ayacko because he was the best among the aspirants who came forth. "We conducted an opinion poll in Migori and he emerged the winner. His loyalty to ODM is also tried and tested," he added. The nomination of Mr Ayacko prompted Migori Governor Okoth Obado to revolt and back Mr Eddy Oketch of the Federal Party of Kenya. Mr Obado, who is now in remand over the murder of his pregnant girlfriends Sharon Otieno, said the nominee was picked through a boardroom deal and did not take into account the wishes of the majority. Mr Odinga is camping in the region for two days to ward off opposition from Mr Oketch who has deployed a chopper in his campaigns.  More follows.
