Agribusiness stakeholders are set for a trade mission to the Netherlands to study innovative food production systems and agricultural export models. The three-day tour will largely focus on horticulture, but integrate general agribusiness, seeking to expose Kenya to the Dutch’s developed and sustainable economy, mainly driven by innovative agribusiness production. “The key objective of this mission is to strengthen local production systems, access international markets, stimulate local food production and expand investment opportunities in agribusiness,” said John Karegwa, the organisers’ spokesperson. Through the involvement of partners such as GreenTech Trade Expo, and the Netherlands Export Combination (NEC), experts from the international horticultural industry, research institutes, and governmental institutions will share their insights and experience with the Kenyan delegates. With trade volumes between the two countries standing at Sh60 billion in 2016, Netherlands is Kenya’s third largest trading partner, with major Kenyan exports to Netherlands comprising horticulture, and importing machinery, chemicals and services. “This mission expects to attract buyers and investors to Kenya, as it showcases the milestones in the sector, with participants benefiting from information-sharing, market access and potential financial support,” noted Mr Karegwa. Delegates will also visit the GreenTech Trade Expo in Amsterdam, one of the leading horticulture and agribusiness exhibitions in the world.   Dairy societies can enhance business management skills and governance practices to ensure more profitable operations.
