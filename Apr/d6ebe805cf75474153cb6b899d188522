Schools are reopening this week for the second and most demanding term that will be fully packed with activities. It is also the longest term, combining academic and major co-curricular programmes. As the learners engage in games and other programmes, the examination classes will be putting their preparations in full gear, as teachers strive to cover the syllabuses and begin revision ahead of the tests. FLOODSHowever, this new school term begins at a time when rains have been wreaking havoc on infrastructure, including damaging buildings in some of these institutions. Schools in the worst affected areas will not reopen until their damaged classrooms and other facilities are restored. Of course, this will be to the detriment of the students, as they will have to stay away from school while their counterparts, with whom they will sit the same exam at the end of the year, continue learning. HEAD TEACHERSBesides this natural calamity of raging destructive floods, programmes in some of the schools will also be seriously affected by the recent massive transfer of head teachers and principals. Some of these school heads, who had made their plans for the whole year, now have to start afresh in their new stations. Though the transfers are good in principle, to rejuvenate the management of schools, the execution has been somewhat wanting. Ideally such transfers should be carried out at the beginning of the year instead of bang in the middle of the academic calendar, when they are likely to cause needless disruptions. However, the decision is not going to be reversed and itâ€™s important that the challenges notwithstanding, the school programmes must go on. The school heads and their teachers must do everything to minimise the adverse effect of these changes on the learners.
