Some 309 workers have been suspended by the Homa Bay County government. This was after a report showed they were “not employed procedurally”. The report, by a team appointed by Governor Cyprian Awiti, was to investigate a bloated wage bill. “Out of the 309 workers whose appointment raised questions, three did not have appointment letters, 24 had doubtful signatures, and two had fake or forged documents,” said Mr Awiti.
