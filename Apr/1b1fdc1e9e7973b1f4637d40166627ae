Several female students have accused Kenya Medical Training College in Mwingi of discrimination and harassment after they were barred from entering the learning facility wearing hijabs. The students said the dress code issue started two months ago after a new deputy principal ordered them to drop their hijabs when in class. “Our female students have not been able to attend school for the last three days as the management has directed the gatekeeper not to allow them [to enter] in their hijabs,” said Mr Abdullahi Hassan, a male student. Mr Hassan also claimed male Muslim students have also been subjected to discrimination at the school gate during security searches. The students are now pleading with the KMTC Board to intervene since their female colleagues have accessed the school for three days. KMTC Board chairman, Philip Kaloki, has directed the school management to allow the students to enter the facility as they seek to resolve the matter. Prof Kaloki promised to visit the medical college next week to meet with the management over the issue. Efforts by Nation to get a comment on the phone and in person from the deputy principal and principal have been futile.
