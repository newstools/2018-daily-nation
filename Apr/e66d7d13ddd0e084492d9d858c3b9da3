Marsabit County Public Service Board on Wednesday summoned the County Secretary Malicha Boru over transfers of 18 middle level officials. In a letter dated April 17, the Board has alleged that the transfer was effected without due procedure. The transfers come seven months after 32 other county officials were transferred without warning. DISCRIMINATION Some of the officials transferred last year wrote to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission claiming that the county government was discriminating against based on their ethnicity. In the recent transfer, those affected also accused the county government of ethnically discriminating against them. However, the county government spokesperson Issa Gambare told journalists that transfers were normal and that the government had the authority to manage county employees. “Every officer should accept the call to serve in offices that have been found suitable for them. Improvement of service delivery to our people can only be done when we have people serving them without hesitation,” said Mr Gambore. One of the employees affected by the job transfers refused to vacate his office forcing county officials to change the locks. “Everyone should report to their new offices without causing any fracas and by all means, the government will ensure that happens,” said Mr Gambore. Several of the employees who were transferred last year were fired after criticizing the county government’s decision to move them.
