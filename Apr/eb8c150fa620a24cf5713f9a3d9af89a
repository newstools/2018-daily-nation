Dear Brenda, What makes men sleep with house girls?  This is not a particularly great mystery, my dear. I'm not sure how to answer you. It's kind of the same answer to why do men cheat, which means it's a variety of answers. In summary, some men cheat. Some men sleep with house helps. Why do they do it? Some men do it because they can. Some men do it because they want to. Some men prefer house helps. Some men were already planning to sleep with the house help anyway. Some men like a buffet. Some men just do. What you need to figure out is if it bothers you and why it does. If you're in a relationship with a man who sleeps with house helps and you are not the house help, decide whether to fire her and your man, or retire the marriage. ***  Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
