Atheists have supported Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba’s call on rich men to marry many wives. In a statement, lobby group Atheists in Kenya (AIK) said Ms Wamuchomba has introduced a healthy social debate on the topic which churches should embrace. SOLUTION They said polygamy offers a solution to infidelity and divorces. “We must acknowledge that monogamy is hurting many married men and women in Kenya. Monogamy in many cases leads to marital infidelity, the lathering of 'illegitimate' children and the pursuit of younger women or trophy wives, ostensibly by men,” the statement signed by AIK President Harrison Mumia read in part. They called on the acceptance of polygamous marriages as it would lessen the financial burden and domestic strife in most families. The group urge the church to accommodate polygamous marriages as a more practical way of addressing family issues. They accused the church of propagating a monogamous stereotype and creating stigma against polygamy. “The stigma associated with polygamy is a creation of the church. The church remains the greatest barrier to change, even as we debate this subject,” Mr Mumia said.   Pastor makes case for polygamy saying there are many women without husbands.
