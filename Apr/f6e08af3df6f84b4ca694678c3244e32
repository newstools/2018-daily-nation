GOLD COAST English fighter Galal Yafai said he had trumped his two boxer brothers — one of them a world champion — after he sealed Commonwealth Games gold on Saturday. The 25-year-old is the younger brother of Khalid, the unbeaten WBA super-flyweight world title-holder, and Gamal, who is also a pro fighter. But Galal, a Rio 2016 Olympian, said his light-flyweight Commonwealth title at Australia's Gold Coast gave him bragging rights. "They haven't won the Commonwealths so it's something I've got over them," he said after his split-decision win over India's Amit, who goes by just one name. "I should have been European champion as well, but I can rectify that in the future." He added: "We're not really that competitive as brothers, I just do my own thing really." Gold was especially satisfying for Yafai after the disappointment of taking a contentious silver at the European Championships last year. Asked how he would celebrate getting one over his elder brothers, Yafai said: "I might have a few burgers and chips and a few fizzy pops." There was further cause for celebration for England's boxers when Lisa Whiteside, who suffered a fractured skull a few years ago in a freak accident, won women's flyweight gold. Paige Murney, another English fighter, lost her lightweight final and settled for silver.   He is one of the products of the GB Boxing programme.
