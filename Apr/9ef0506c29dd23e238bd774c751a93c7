Lately, the world has been desperately craving for a traditional Ericsson phone, after the great Nokia comeback with HMD, but in this case, the wait might be longer. Sony long dropped Ericsson, and is now just Sony, and though it’s been a while since we have come across a Sony phone, the new Xperia XA2 Ultra seems worth the wait. UPGRADE This phone comes running on an Octa-core 2.2 GHz Cortex-A53 processor on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 chipset, backed by 4GB of RAM and a choice of either 32GB or 64GB storage. The phone sports an Adreno 508 GPU that provides its handiwork on a 6.0 inch full HD display. They have gone all out on the cameras, tapping an interesting 23 MP rear camera with LED flash as well as face detection autofocus, while upfront, they have opted for a dual 16MP +8 MP arrangement, an interesting arrangement. It is an LTE phone with a dual-SIM setup, supports 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 5.0, has a rear mounted fingerprint sensor, and will take a Type C port to charge. It comes running on Sony’s older slate design, which doesn’t make it unattractive, just not the most beautiful of its kind. The 3850 mAh battery is utterly impressive, going for a solid two days without needing to recharge. This is one of Sony’s attempt at a nice mid-range phone, costing Sh45,000, which isn’t bad, given the specs. However, the one downside to this is that you will have to live with the bloatware this phone comes with.   It is a rock solid performer and will play nearly any game you throw at it.
