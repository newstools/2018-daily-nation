Police in Mumias are investigating the death of an Anglican Church of Kenya clergyman whose body was found in his rented house on Saturday morning. Peter Muniafu, a priest at Butere Diocese, was found dead at Lukoye estate in Mumias West sub-county. The cleric was last seen by neighbours on Thursday evening when he entered his house. “His friend knocked on his door several times but there was no response. He went to the rear window and saw the body in a pool of blood," Mr Julius Okumu, a neighbour, said. "He called me and said something was wrong with the reverend.” HEAD INJURIES The two reported the incident to the police. Area OCPD Peter Kattam said officers forced their way into the house since the door was locked from the inside. “The body was on the floor. We found a blood-stained knife in the toilet,” Mr Kattam said. The body had had neck and head injuries. He said detectives have launched investigations into the death. “It is likely he killed himself because the door was locked from the inside,” Mr Kattam added. “We will know the exact cause of the death after a postmortem examination. Let us not speculate.” ACK faithful arrived at the scene in tens before the body was taken to St Mary’s Hospital mortuary.   He asked friends and area MP Benjamin Washiali to send him money for funeral expenses.
