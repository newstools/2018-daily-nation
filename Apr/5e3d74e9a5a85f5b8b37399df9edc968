Police have arrested a wanted man accused of cyberbullying and trying to extort money from members of Parliament. Mr Wazir Boniface Chacha is accused of soliciting money from MPs disguised as Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege. EXTORTION Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti on Sunday said Mr Chacha was arrested in Tarime, Tanzania, as he planned to flee to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mr Kinoti said Tanzanian police helped coordinate the operation and are escorting the Kenyan officers and the suspect to the Isebania border. Last week, police appealed for help in arresting Mr Chacha and offered a Sh20,000 reward. Mr Chacha, who police said was the main suspect, had not been found but was further linked to a love affair that entangled a former MP. Three of his accomplices, including an M-Pesa agent, have since been arrested. The M-Pesa agent, according to detectives, colluded with fraudsters to register an M-Pesa account bearing the name and identification details of Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege. This was then used to con the legislators. On March 22, Mr Kinoti told MPs that police had arrested 70 people involved in the scam of soliciting money from MPs. Among those who have fallen victim and sent money to the suspect are National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi who sent Sh300,000, former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo (Sh20,000), Cabinet secretaries Eugene Wamalwa (Devolution), Peter Munya (EAC), Margaret Kobia (Public Service) and Sicily Kariuki (Health).   Director of Criminal Investigations offers Sh20,000 reward for information that leads to suspect’s arrest.
