Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’ has differed with Governor Cyprian Awiti over the dismissal of over 300 workers by the county government. Senator Kajwang’ wants the governor to thoroughly audit the workforce and send senior officers responsible for the bloated wage bill home. “Problems affecting Homa Bay County are more than the 300 irregularly hired workers. It is irresponsible senior offices who have brought the county to its knees,” Mr Kajwang’ said. He argues that the county secretary, the public service board and county executives are the people who should take responsibility for the bloated wage bill because they hire the workers. “Your bold move would be incomplete if you do not bring to account all the relevant officers who perpetrated this scandal either by omission or commission,” Mr Kajwang’ said. In a letter addressed to the governor, the senator argued that the strategic solution to the wage bill problem in the county lies in conducting a job evaluation, capacity assessment and rationalisation. He said residents of Homa Bay are yearning for a functional healthcare system, good roads, flowing water and industries that utilise local raw materials. On Monday, the county government suspended 309 workers after it was discovered that they were employed unprocedurally. Also suspended was the head of payroll Joseph Omondi.   This was after a report showed they were “not employed procedurally”.
