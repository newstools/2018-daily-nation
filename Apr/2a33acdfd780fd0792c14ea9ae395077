Vaccine schedule for Kienyeji birds How many times do I need to vaccinate my Kienyeji chicken? And at what duration sir? Willis Sungu, Kisumu There are many vaccination protocols but the schedule above would suffice. When administering vaccines through water, ensure that the birds are deprived of drinking water for 1-2 hours so that they are thirsty enough to drink the vaccine immediately once presented to them. Like for all vaccines administered through drinking water, ensure that water used to dilute the vaccine is free from chlorine or any disinfectants as they may affect the efficacy of the vaccine. Deworm regularly using Piperin WS available in Kisumu Apex, among other agrovets. **** Drop in egg laying in Kienyeji birds I have been rearing Kienyeji chickens for two years but of late the birds have dropped laying eggs. What’s the problem? Wuod Jaraha, Homa Bay It is not clear whether your birds are reared in confinement or are free-range. However, during this cold season, if their feed ration is not increased, production is sure to decline. This is because the chicken requires much more energy for their maintenance. Disease, if present, would also cause a drop. **** Weed control in pasture Any suggestion for weed control in fields where Dorper sheep are kept? Kirsty Sutherland, from Nanyuki A colleague has advised that you spray Dicopur, a selective herbicide that kills all the broad leaved plants leaving the grass. **** Rearing Toggenburg goats I’d like to rear Toggenburg goats and I live in Nakuru North District.
