The Gikuyu Cultural Association has supported the call by Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba ufor financially endowed men to take up more wives. During a special delegates conference in Naivasha over the weekend, the more than 200 members endorsed the call, terming it a step in the right direction. In a statement read on their behalf by the association’s Secretary-General Joseph King’ori, the elders said that as custodians of heritage and culture, they have the moral duty to guide the youth. “We are fully behind the call for polygamy but only for those able to support such families. It is optional,” he said. HYPOCRISY The lawmaker caused a stir last week when she said polygamy would offer a solution to alcoholism and the street families' menace. Mr King’ori said the cultural leaders came up with the resolution after seven hours of deliberations. “It is not a standard rule for every community member to be in a polygamous relationship,” he said. The association’s chairman, Mr Kigochi Waimiri, accused those opposed to polygamy of hypocrisy. “Some of them are in several secret relationships. All what we want is to see the unions legalised,” he said. The elders said it is shame that most illicit relationships only come to the fore when one party dies, leading to protracted legal battles. SENIOR ELDERS Mr Waimiri added that the association would be restructured, with national office bearers being referred to as athuri a mathati (senior elders) instead of athamaki (kings) “to reflect the reality on the ground". At the same time, the association hailed the unity deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. The elders said they are ready to join the two leaders to promote peace and cohesion in the country.   Gathoni Wamuchomba says men, who sire children with different women, should marry them.
