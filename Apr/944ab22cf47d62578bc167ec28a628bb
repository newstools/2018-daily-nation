The 36 cars already entered for this year’s CBA Africa Concours d’Elegance include machines which will be appearing for the first time at the Nairobi Racecourse. Among these are a 1937 Nash and a 1952 Chevrolet Impala convertible which are being prepared by Magdi Riad for the annual motor show. The 2018 Concours will be the 48th held by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club and is scheduled for September 30 at Nairobi Racecourse. Magdi’s Nash was made in the United States but is now in a derelict state requiring a complete rebuild. According to Magdi, both the Nash and the Chevrolet Impala convertible were once owned by William Holden, the famous Hollywood star and founder of the Mount Kenya Safari Club. During Holden’s involvement with the club a line of luxury cottages was constructed for use by stars of the film and entertainment worlds. Apparently the Nash and the Chevrolet Impala were used to carry rich and famous guests. The regulations and the entry forms are available on the Concours website www.concourskenya.com.
