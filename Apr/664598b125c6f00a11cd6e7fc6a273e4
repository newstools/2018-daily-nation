Juba, Sudanese President Omar Bashir Tuesday ordered all political prisoners released. The Sudan News Agency (Suna) quoted President Bashir saying the move was to allow everyone a chance to participate in solving the country's problems. The release of political prisoners "comes to strengthen the spirit of reconciliation and national harmony and peace, which emerged from the national dialogue, both political and community," Suna said. Sudan is facing a combination of economic meltdown and rebellion in different parts. The country's revenues from oil fell drastically following the secession of South Sudan in 2011. President Bashir, who came to power in 1989, has ruthlessly dealt with dissents, whose resistance has nevertheless persisted. He faces an arrest warrant by International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed in Western Sudan's Darfur.
