Harambee Stars defender Aboud Omar has been sacked by his club Slavia Sofia after he was accused of insulting his team mates and coaches. In a statement by the Bulgarian club's president Ventseslav Stefanov posted on its website on Thursday, the problems had been going on for several months with the Kenya international accuse of also showing disrespect to Bulgaria. "I decided to remove Aboud Omar from the team and his contractual relations with the club will be suspended under the existing legal order," Slavia president Ventseslav Stefanov said in a statement. The 25-year-old left back became the first Kenyan player in the Bulgarian league when he joined them in 2016 from the Greek second tier. He was instrumental in helping the seven-times Bulgarian champions qualify for the Europa League a few months later. Before going to Europe, he featured for Tusker and Bandari in the Kenyan Premier League. "For no apparent reason, the player became cruel and arrogant," Stefanov said. "He learned the most vulgar phrases in Bulgarian and began to address them to his team mates without exception. "The impudent Kenyan began to curse everything, related to life in our country and did not try to conceal his dislike for the Bulgarian state at all..." Stefanov said that all Slavia players unanimously supported his decision to dismiss Omar, capped more than 30 times by Kenya.
