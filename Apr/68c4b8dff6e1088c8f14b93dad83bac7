For several months now, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and his Nyeri counterpart, Mr Mutahi Kahiga, have discharged their duties without deputies. In Nairobi, this was occasioned by a resignation, while in Nyeri, the seat fell vacant after Mr Kahiga, who was the deputy governor, was elevated last November following his boss’s death. The waiting continues despite last month’s Supreme Court advisory that a governor has 14 days to nominate someone for deputy governor should a vacancy arise. REJECT NOMINEE The court advised that the County Assembly should either approve or reject the nominee within 60 days. The delay in picking deputy governors is unwarranted. It is also against the Constitution, which envisaged such a position, whose holder is the principal assistant to the governor. For governors, having deputies who can serve in their stead when they are out of the office on duty, indisposed or simply need a break, is of great benefit. UNCERTAINTY It insulates a county from uncertainty should a sitting governor cease to hold office for whatever reason. This matter should be urgently sorted out. The two governors should quickly start the process of appointing their deputies. However, it’s noteworthy that the Senate has already passed a bill on the appointment of governors’ deputies, which will soon be tabled in the National Assembly, before the President signs it into law.
