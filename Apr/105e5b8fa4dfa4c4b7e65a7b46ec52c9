Kenya virtually wraps up competition at the 21st Commonwealth Games on Saturday, with only the men’s and women’s marathon races pencilled for Sunday’s final day of action. On Saturday, Kenya will be in action in athletics, shooting, sevens rugby, wrestling and cycling. In shooting, Gurupreet Dhanjal and Gulraj Sehmi will attempt the 50-metre rifle three positions competition at the Belmont Shooting Centre with the men’s rugby team launching their campaign with pool matches against Canada, New Zealand and Canada at the Robina Stadium. Realistically, Kenya could mint two more gold medals in the women’s 5,000 metres and men’s 1,500m final on Saturday. In the women’s race, world champion Hellen Obiri will lead a strong team that has Margaret Chelimo and Eva Cherono. Another world champion, Elijah Manangoi, Kenya’s overall captain here, heads the 1,500m charge. Also lined up is the men’s cycling time trial. Suleiman Kangangi, Salim Kipkemboi, David Kinja and Peter Gathere will be on the saddles. It will be Obiri’s first time to compete in Australia and the world champion is excited at the prospects. “I’ve never travelled this far. But the weather here is OK and I look forward to a great performance, a gold medal,” said Obiri. In the men’s 1,500m qualifiers on Friday, last year’s IAAF World Championships silver medallist Timothy Cheruiyot won Heat One in 3:42.95 with world junior champion Kumari Taki taking third (3:43.93) and also qualifying automatically. Manangoi won Heat Two in 3:46.82 and will be hot favourite for the gold when the final is run today from 6.10pm (9.10am Kenyan time). “I’m happy we all made it to the final,” Cheruiyot said. “It was tough, but we all made it so tomorrow it will be teamwork so that we get the medals,” said Cheruiyot who wasn’t too concerned with the rather slow times posted. “Time was slow because this is a championship.” Manangoi was equally upbeat. “We wanted to all get into the final. We now want to get back and strategize on how we shall run in the final tomorrow. “I’m targeting to get any medal, either gold, silver or bronze. I will be grateful for any colour of medal.” SATURDAYPROGRAMME Shooting: 2am: Men’s 50m rifle three positions: Gurupreet Dhanjal, Gulraaj Sehmi; Rugby: Men’s Pool ‘C’: Canada vs Kenya (10.15am, 3.15am Kenyan time), Kenya vs New Zealand (2.17pm, 7.17am Kenyan time); Kenya vs Zambia (8.27pm, 1.27pm Kenyan time); Women’s Pool C: Kenya vs South Africa (12,27pm, 5.27am Kenyan time); Cycling: Men’s road race: From 12.30pm (5.30am, Kenyan time): Suleiman Kangangi, Salim Kipkemboi, David Kinja and Peter Gathere; Wrestling: 10.30am (3.30am, Kenyan time): Men’s freestyle, 86kg qualifying: Mark Inguyesi vs Syerus Eslami (England); Athletics: 2.35pm (7.35am, Kenyan time): Men’s javelin final: Alex Kiprotich; Women’s 5,000m final, 3.20pm (8.20am Kenyan time): Hellen Obiri, Margaret Chelimo, Eva Cherono; Men’s 1,500m final: 4.10pm (9.10am Kenyan time): Kumari Taki, Timothy Cheruiyot, Elijah Manangoi; Men’s 4x400m relay final: Boniface Mweresa, Mike Mokamba, Collins Omae and Peter Mwai   The previous Game Record of 8:10.44 was set by Jonathan Muia in 2014 Glasgow.
