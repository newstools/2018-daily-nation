Kenya's Mary Keitany is targeting a "lifetime goal" as she tries to break Paula Radcliffe's world record with a fourth victory in the London Marathon. Keitany, 36, lowered Radcliffe's women-only record last year with a time of 2:17:01 and will run with male pacemakers on Sunday in an attempt to beat the 'mixed race' mark of 2:15:25 set in London in 2003. Whether she breaks the record or not, victory for Keitany on Sunday would take her past Radcliffe and level with Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen as a four-time winner. "To run 2:15 is really something else. But I will try to follow in the footsteps of the legend, Paula, on Sunday. "I must thank the race organisers for their decision to assist the women to see how fast we can go. With the male pacemakers we have a great opportunity and we have to try and see if it's possible. Twelve men in Sunday's field have run faster than Farah, with Kenenisa Bekele and Eliud Kipchoge, the second and third-fastest men in history, among those a full three minutes quicker, and defending champion Daniel Wanjiru one of four with a 2:04-something to their names.   The 35-year-old Somalia-born runner says he will fight for a podium place.
