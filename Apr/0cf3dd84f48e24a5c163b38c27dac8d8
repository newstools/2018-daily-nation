Kenyan international athletes in Uasin Gishu County might soon have a reason to smile after members of the county assembly unanimously passed a motion to exempt them from paying parking fees in Eldoret. The mover of the motion, Mr Gilbert Tenai (Cheptiret/Kipchamo ward), said he was compelled to act following constant harassment and mistreatment of the athletes by county enforcement officers when they park in the town. He said the sportsmen and women have marketed the country globally after winning various races and one way to appreciate their sterling performance is to exempt them from parking fees. “The motion has been passed by all county assembly members and it is only waiting to be signed into law by the executive for its implementation,” Mr Tenai said. Eldoret is home to former and current top athletes, among them former world steeplechase record holder Ezekiel Kemboi, Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge and New York city marathon winner Mary Keitany.
