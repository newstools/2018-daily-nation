After a largely disappointing outing at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, athletes turn their focus on the Athletics Kenya Track and Field Championships series starting on Friday at the University of Eldoret. Athletics Kenya Central Rift chairman Abraham Mutai disclosed Thursday that strong fields are expected in both track and field events. Kenya had a hugely disappointing outing in Gold Coast, where the country managed 17 medals, with only four gold. Mutai said the event could also see the return of 2007 World 800m champion Janeth Jepkosgei after a three-year break. Also set for the battle is the 2013 World 800m champion Eunice Sum, who is likely to compete in 1500m. Internationals Job Kinyor and Sammy Jirongo are set for the 800m showdown with Nixon Chepseba due to highlight the 1500m. The 2015 World 3,000m steeplechase champion Hyvin Kiyeng will compete for the first time on track since winning bronze at the World Championships in London last year. However, she will battle in 5,000m. The fourth leg of the track and field is a precursor to the 2018 Diamond League Series that gets underway May 5 in Doha and the Africa Senior Championships due for August 1-5 in Assaba, Delta State, Nigeria. The trials for the continental championships will definitely attract some of Kenya's top stars since the event will be used to select Africa's team for the IAAF Continental Cup also known as the World Cup due September 8-9 in Ostrava, Czech Republic. "This is the home of track and field stars hence we should expect quality fields," said Mutai. THREE EVENTS HELD The Track and Field series have been to Kisii, Kisumu and Machakos before taking a break for Commonwealth Games that ended last weekend. Africa 100 silver medallist Eunice Kedogo and fellow sprinter Fresha Mwangi go head-to-head in the 100m with Africa 10,000m champion Alice Aprot set to return after failing to qualify for the "Club Games." Africa 5,000m champion Douglas Serem and Africa 5,000m bronze medallist Mangata Ndiwa will highlight men's 5,000m while Africa high jump champion Matthew Sawe will compete in his speciality.
