Bidco United FC defeated hosts Green Commandoes FC 3-0 in a National Super League (NSL) match at Bukhungu stadium in Kakamega on Monday. A goal each from Seah Opwora, Geoffrey Kariuki and Nelson Chieta was enough for the Thika-based outfit to sink the league debutantes, who have found the going in the lower tier league tough. Out of 10 matches they have so far played, Commandoes, who are sponsored by Kakamega High School, have only won twice. They have lost six times and draw two matches in the 19-team league. Bidco took the lead via Opwora, who capitalized on a loose ball in the box to over stretch custodian Brian Opondo in the 14th minute. Efforts by Commandoes strikers Michael Givogi, Rodgers Angel and Mandela Makuto to score were time and again frustrated by their opponents' defence marshalled by Jacob Onyango. In an effort to contain the marauding Bidco defenders, the hosts resorted to offside traps which backfired as Bidco striker Karuiki was quick on the ball to hit the roof of the net in the 26th minute. After the breather, Bidco put the game beyond their opponents' reach as attacker Chieta outsprinted defender Onyango before hitting the back of the for the third goal. To reinforce the striking force, Commandos Coach Eliud Omukuya substituted Michael Givogi and Riziki Mwema, whose positions were taken up by Henry Atolwa and Collins Sichenje respectively. Bidco Tactician Leonard Saleh also made substitutions replacing David Juma and Nelson Chieta with Douglas Mokaya and Vincent Waweru in that order. After the encounter, Commandos coach Omukuya attributed their defeat to injuries sustained by some of his key players in recent league matches. “Most of those injured are strikers. This made me to use second string players in such a tough league match,” he noted. Bidco tactician Saleh attributed his team’s victory to a well co-ordinated match from his players. “The boys followed my instructions to the letter which yielded fruits,” he said.
