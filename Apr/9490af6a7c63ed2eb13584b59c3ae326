MANCHESTER Liverpool's chances of reaching a first Champions League semi-final for 10 years received a huge boost as 38-goal top scorer Mohamed Salah was passed fit to start their quarter-final, second leg at Manchester City on Tuesday. Salah opened the scoring in last week's first leg to help Liverpool amass a commanding 3-0 lead in the tie. Georginio Wijnaldum comes in for the suspended Jordan Henderson in Jurgen Klopp's only change from the first leg. City manager Pep Guardiola sprang a huge surprise by leaving his top scorer Sergio Aguero on the bench in an otherwise extremely offensive-minded line-up. Former Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva are introduced at the expense of club captain Vincent Kompany and Ilkay Gundogan for the side that started at Anfield. Guardiola makes four changes from the side beaten 3-2 by Manchester United on Saturday with the chance to seal the Premier League title as Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Gabriel Jesus return after being rested at the weekend. Starting line-ups: Manchester City (3-4-3) Ederson; Kyle Walker, Nicolas Otamendi, Aymeric Laporte; Fernandinho (captain), Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Bernardo Silva; Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Leroy Sane Coach: Pep Guardiola (ESP) Liverpool (4-3-3): Loris Karius; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dejan Lovren, Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson; James Milner (captain), Georginio Wijnaldum, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain; Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane Coach: Jurgen Klopp (GER) Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (ESP)   The Reds are sweating on the fitness of striker Mohamed Salah.
