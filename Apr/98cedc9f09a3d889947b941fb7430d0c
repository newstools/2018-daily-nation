Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has ordered for the closure of Kibarani dumpsite within 70 days. Kibarani, the largest dumpsite in Kenya's tourism city, is an eyesore for both tourists and residents. The dumpsite is located along Mombasa-Nairobi highway in Kibarani. Speaking on Friday while launching a fleet of 12 new garbage collection trucks at the Treasury Square in Mombasa, Governor Joho ordered county executives in the Health, Trade and Tourism, and Environment dockets to close down the dumpsite “I don’t know what mechanism you will put in place, but I want that dumpsite closed by end of June. No more dumping of waste in Kibarani," Mr Joho said. For months, Mombasa West residents have been suffering due to shutdown of illegal dumpsites forcing them to walk to Kibarani to dump their waste. Mr Joho said he will give his executives equipment and support to deal with the garbage menace. Located at the gateway into the Coastal city before the Makupa causeway on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, the Kibarani dumpsite has been a constant eyesore to the residents and visitors alike. The governor thanked the county staff for their support in ensuring that the county is clean despite the challenges. “Whatever circumstances, I am grateful to the staff at the county. Certainly there will be a lot of challenges for the government to attain its goals. Whether we like it or not, whether people want to appreciate it or not, there has been tremendous progress unlike in the past,” Governor Joho said. His Deputy Governor William Kingi asked the residents to be responsible in managing garbage and stop littering.
