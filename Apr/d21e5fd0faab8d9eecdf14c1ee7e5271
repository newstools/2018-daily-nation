The government has set aside Sh4 billion to enroll three million secondary schools students into the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) across the country, Deputy President William Ruto has said. Speaking at Murang’a High School on Friday, DP Ruto said the program, which was one of President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaign promises, will be launched next month. The introduction of the free medical cover was announced last year by the Ministry of Education through the guidelines of free day secondary education. In the guidelines, the government said it would allocate Sh1,999 per student annually. “The government of Kenya will pay for the health insurance scheme for our students, we want to carry the burden of the parents and encourage our students to concentrate in learning without worrying of who shall take care of them whenever they get sick,” DP Ruto said. SCHOOL FEES The Deputy President also warned public schools heads charging extra fees in the guise of infrastructural development that they will be dealt with since the government has channelled enough money to boarding schools. “No parent should be forced to contribute money for infrastructure in their schools and no child should be sent home because of monetary issues,” said the DP Ruto. DP Ruto’s warning came at a time Murang’a High School has been on the spot for imposing an extra Sh40,000 on parents for development purposes without consultation.   Students head back to class for Term One of what will be a defining year for education sector.
