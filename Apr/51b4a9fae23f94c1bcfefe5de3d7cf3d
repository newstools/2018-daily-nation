The National Assembly’s Committee on Agriculture and Irrigation urged the Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri, to declare the pest infestation an emergency situation. “At least Sh1 billion should be allocated for mitigation efforts eradicate the pest. By doing so, we shall be addressing a very crucial situation [which] is one of the biggest in history to have griped our farmers,” said Moiben MP Silas Tiren.

While reiterating that agriculture is a devolved function, CS Kiunjuri said he is set to hold a meeting with governors on Monday to discuss the issue further. “But because of the magnitude of armyworm effects, we have to assist. Governors and especially those from the affected regions need to tell us their preparedness,” the CS said.
