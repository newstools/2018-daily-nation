Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has warned security chiefs who fail to contain rising cases of crime in the areas of jurisdiction that they will be sacked. In Nyamira, his home county, Dr Matiang’i decried recent incidents of kidnapping and said police officers and local administrators will pay for it if the attacks persist. “I am dismayed by what we are witnessing here. Such nonsense cannot be condoned,” he said. In Suneka, which is in the neighbouring Kisii County, a pastor has been missing for the past four weeks after he was kidnapped by unknown people. “Security bosses will face the sack unless they strive to help the government in realising its key objective of securing property and lives of citizens. “If you are not ready to work with the government, you better quit and do something else. You can even just become a farmer,” Dr Matiang’i said. Addressing a gathering at Mwongori High School Dr Matiang'i decried the rising insecurity levels in Kisii and Nyamira counties.
