Survivors of medical errors such as the recent surgery mix-up at the Kenyatta National Hospital often take long to shake off the trauma as they recuperate. During this period, however, everything possible must be done to ease their recovery. Besides medical experts, the administrative authorities, regulators and others have a key role to play. The consequences of the horrendous incident in Busia County three years ago, in which 28 children were mistakenly injected with a toxic substance in an anti-malaria campaign, still linger on. COMPENSATION This was not only shocking, but also left a big blot on the history of medical practice in this country. What was to be a routine malaria jab turned out to be the start of a nightmare for the children and their parents, as they became incapacitated. As the High Court found out after hearing the petition for compensation, the victims suffered permanent physical disability of between five and 20 per cent. ANGUISHThe judge summed up the feelings of many when he declared that, for a child to wake up one morning and find herself paralysed, such a child would suffer mental anguish. He awarded the victims Sh40 million as compensation and gave the county government 45 days â€“ from December 19, last year - to pay up. To date, nothing has happened despite the parents having presented the required documents and the County Assembly having approved the compensation. Considering the agony and suffering the children have gone through, the compensation must be speeded up.
