Police in Kisumu on Saturday night shot dead a suspected carjacker in Migosi Ward. Two of the suspect’s accomplices escaped with bullets wounds, police said. Area OCPD Mr Christopher Mutune said on Sunday that the three suspects had carjacked a man at his gate in Milimani Estate at about 9.30pm. He said after the car owner informed police officers of the incident, the officers tracked down the suspects. The suspects defied orders to surrender, resulting to a long chase from the Central Business District to Kenya-Re Estate gate. “They (suspects) refused to surrender and engaged our officers in a long chase from the CBD. The officers caught up with them at the Kenya-Re Estate gate where one was shot dead while the rest escaped with bullet wounds,” said Mr Mutune. SPEEDING AWAY He added: “The carjacking happened at Milimani Estate as the car owner was getting inside his compound; the suspects ordered him out of the car before speeding away.” The car rolled several times at the time of the shooting. The OCPD has appealed to members of the public and hospitals to share with the police information of anybody with bullet wounds. “They were armed and we must arrest them. We appeal to the public and hospitals to inform us (police) when they come across someone with bullet wounds,” said the officer. CRIME Crime in Kisumu has been on the rise in the recent past. Last weekend, the residents petitioned security heads in the region to act on the perpetrators before the matter gets out of hand. Kisumu residents raised concern of the resurgence of criminal gangs in the city.
