Eleven -time Kenyan Premier League (KPL) champions Tusker edged out 10-man AFC Leopards 4-2 in a six-goal thriller played at a soggy but packed Kericho Green Stadium on Monday. Timothy Otieno capitalised on a comical error from Leopards goalkeeper Gabriel Andika to score the opener in the sixth minute. Andika’s clearance from Mike Kibwage's back pass was blocked by Otieno with ball rolling into the back of the net.     Twenty seven minutes later, Andika was the culprit again, as he tackled the former Gor Mahia striker, Otieno inside the area to concede a penalty and also given his marching orders by the referee. His dismissal forced Ingwe coach Dennis Kitambi to sacrifice Nigerian midfielder Henry Uche for custodian Jairus Adira, who was beaten by Otieno from the resultant penalty in the 32nd minute. Leopards halved the deficit four minutes to the halftime break via Isaac Oduro's penalty, after Lloyd Wahome had fouled Marvin Omondi inside the area. Tusker coach Sam Timbe withdrew Matthew Odongo for Peter Nzuki two minutes after the restart and Nzuki turned provider for the third goal at the hour mark. The former Nakumatt man picked out Wahome with a beautiful cross, with the latter beating Adira with a header at the far post.   Leopards’ fighting spirit was envisaged two minutes after the hour mark, when Ezekiel Odera floated in a cross that Whyvonne Isuza headed home to make it 3-2. Wahome completed his brace 15 minutes to time with a close range finish after Adira punched Collins Shivachi’s free kick from 20-yards. Leopards rallied on but their efforts bore no fruit. The result sees Tusker move to 12th spot on nine points, as Leopards remain third on 16 points after eight rounds.   Mutamba broke the deadlock with a 38th minute header.
