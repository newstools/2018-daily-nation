Ushuru have moved to the seventh place in the National Super League (NSL) standings on 18 points after the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) awarded the taxmen three points after a successful appeal against Kisumu AllStars. FKF awarded the former Kenya Premier League side the three points on Wednesday after finding debutants Kisumu All Stars guilty of fielding an illegible player in their last league at Camp Toyoyo grounds in Nairobi on Sunday. The two sides had battled to a 1-1 draw. But Ushuru then lodged a complaint with the FKF to protest a decision by All Stars to field suspended Billy Agai in the match. The All Stars striker was sent off in the 77th minute in their previous clash against leaders Western Stima which took place on April 8 at Moi Stadium in Kisumu after he received a second booking. In a letter addressed to Kisumu All Stars Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Ochieng, FKF said it had awarded Ushuru the three points and two goals as per the rules. “Having looked at the centre referee’s report, we’ve ascertained that indeed your club fielded the mentioned player in a match in total disregard of the communication sent to you notifying you about the player’s suspension and in clear violation of rules and regulation.’’ Rule 3.5 of the Rules of Kenya Football states: "A club which fields a suspended or ineligible player will forfeit all matches in which the player was illegally fielded." Speaking to Nation Sport, Kisumu All Stars head coach Nick Aketch said that he was not aware that a player who is sent off in a match because of two-bookable offences is ineligible to play in the next match. "According to my understanding, only a player who receives a straight red card is suspended from the next match. Honestly, I never knew the same applies to a player who is sent off because of two yellow cards in a match. Thats why we fielded Billy in the game," said Aketch.   The two sides had battled to a 1-1 draw.
