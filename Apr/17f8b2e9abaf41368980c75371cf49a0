Kisumu Woman Rep Rozah Buyu and Nominated Senator Rose Nyamunga have clashed over aid to flood victims. Ms Buyu accused Mrs Nyamunga of opposing distribution of food. However, Mrs Nyamunga said the Woman Rep was leading a smear campaign against her “because I’ve initiated development projects”. On Monday, county special programmes director Ruth Odinga asked the government to have better food distribution mechanisms in order to “stop leaders from using people’s problems for political gain”.
