A foreign businessman was Friday charged before a Nairobi court with failing to remit Sh11.6 billion in valued added tax. Parmar Kirit Kumar Ranchodbhai from India was charged a day after businessman Keval Kumar Navin Maisura was charged with claims of failing to remit Sh7 billion to the taxman. Mr Parmar was arraigned before Nairobi chief magistrate Francis Andayi who released him on Sh3 million surety bond with an alternative cash bail Sh1.5 million. Mr Andayi further directed that the suspect be detained until the process to complete the surety is concluded. PASSPORTThe court further allowed the application by chief KRA prosecutor, Sylvester Okello, to have Mr Parmar’s passport deposited in court as a condition for his release. Mr Parmar, through Lawyer Nick Biketi, applied that he be released on lenient bond term, saying he is not a flight risk. “We kindly request this court to release the accused on lenient bond term. He is married and works in Bungoma and he also undertakes to attend full hearings until the end of his trial,” Mr Biketi said. Mr Parmar allegedly failed to declare Sh3,421,645,274 value added tax returns to Kenya Revenue Authority for 2015 income.
