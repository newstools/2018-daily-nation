Most retailers in Nairobi are selling single sticks of cigarettes despite this being illegal, a study by International Institute for Legislative Affairs (IILA) has revealed. The report also revealed that more than 64 per cent of cigarettes sold in the city are single sticks and are mainly bought by low-income earners, adolescents and children. The study was conducted in the designated smoking zones in the city centre, Kibra, Mathare, Kawangware, Buruburu, Kileleshwa and Karen. Ms Emma Wanyonyi, the ILLA chief executive officer, said the selling of single sticks of cigarettes is a major contributor to the rising number of children addicted to tobacco. "When you give a child Sh10 for their break in school, it is enough for them to buy at least two single sticks. After a while, they get hooked which leads to addiction even before adulthood," Ms Wanyonyi warned. LAW The ILLA CEO said that most retailers are ignorant of the law. Section 18 of the Tobacco Control Act of 2007 states that the sale of cigarettes will only be done as a pack of not less than 10 pieces. Ms Wanyonyi said that the practice is making cigarettes accessible to children. Research conducted by the Centre for Tobacco Control in Africa has revealed that almost 10 per cent of Kenyan youth aged between 13 and 15 are already using tobacco. Ms Wanyonyi urged the government to strengthen the enforcement of the law to make it harder for minors to have access to the dangerous products.   Appeals court ruling means rules take effect immediately.
