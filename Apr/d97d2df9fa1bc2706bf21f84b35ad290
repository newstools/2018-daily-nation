Tuskys Supermarket staff have suspended their planned strike following intervention by the Ministry of Labour. The Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers, in a letter addressed to Tuskys managing director Dan Githua and Labour secretary Ukur Yattani, said it had suspended the planned strike. The union had issued the strike notice citing massive transfer of shop stewards and refusal by the retailer to recognise them as its workers' representative, among other issues. “By a copy of this letter, we hereby advise our members to continue working as we engage the employer to resolve the issues,” reads part of the letter dated April 12 and signed by the union’s secretary-general Boniface Kavuvi. The union had issued strike notice on March 29 and it was due to expire midnight April 12. The workers' lobby says the Ministry of Labour intervention had necessitated them to give dialogue a chance, noting that it would advice members on the way forward after the next round of talks slated for April 20.
