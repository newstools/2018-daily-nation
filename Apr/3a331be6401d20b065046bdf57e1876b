The electoral commission has written to the Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet over the withdrawal of security detail for the agencyâ€™s top chiefs.

IEBC said the move is likely to expose Mr Chebukati and the commissioners to security risk and "undermines their effectiveness in executing the work of the commission".  More follows.
