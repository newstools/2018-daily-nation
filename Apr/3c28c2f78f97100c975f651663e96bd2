A traditional dance by Bungoma High School with a message on national cohesion on Wednesday received a standing ovation at the 59th edition of the Kenya National Drama and Film Festival being held at Lenana School in Nairobi.

The dance was scripted by Meshack Wafula, a student, and choreographed by Toili Khisa and Violet Moga. It was produced by Samuel Kaunda. Wafula, who hails from Bungoma County, happens to be a student from a needy background, but stole the show with his refined talented as he deftly handled instruments such as the litungu, ishiriri and drums besides composing the songs.
