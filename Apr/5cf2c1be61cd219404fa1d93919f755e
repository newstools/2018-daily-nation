Former police chief David Kimaiyo has been appointed as the Kenyatta National Hospital board chairman. Mr Kimaiyo will serve as non-executive chairman for a year, with his term expected to expire on March 17, 2019. His appointment followed President Uhuru Kenyatta's revocation of Mr Mark Bor, a week after MPs demanded the dismissal of the team he led. Mr Bor, a former Public Health and Sanitation Permanent Secretary, has been picked to chair the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, board for three years. BOTCHED SURGERY Last month, the National Assembly adopted a report of its Health committee, which called for the replacement of the entire KNH board “in national interest”. The lawmakers’ decision was triggered by report that doctors performed brain surgery on a wrong patient. “From its interactions with the management, the board, the Cabinet secretary, employees and other people connected to KNH, the committee concluded that there were problems in almost every aspect of the hospital,” the National Assembly committee said in its report. “In recognition of the board’s failure to carry out its functions, the appointing authority, in accordance with the State Corporations Act, constitutes a new board.” COMPETENCE The MPs said there was a culture of reaction and unresponsiveness rather than proactiveness at the country’s largest referral hospital. The committee also asked the new board to appraise the top management “with a view to placing personnel with the right qualifications in these positions”. The removal of Mr Bor and his eventual appointment at MTRH is part of the recent appointments the President has made in several parastatals.
