The appointment of an interim team to run Cricket Kenya following the resignation of the officials led by chairperson Jackie Janmohammed offers an opportunity to revitalise the sport. The interim committee, led by Harpar Singh Sehmi, has three months to set up structures and prepare the ground for fresh elections. The move by Sports Cabinet Secretary Mohamed Echesa is timely. All has not been well in cricket with the standards of the game plummeting for the past decade due to poor management. Kenyan cricket has suffered a lot since the historic 2003 World Cup semi-finals appearance. Wrangles between Cricket Kenya and the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association, Coast Cricket Association and Rift Valley Cricket Association have not been healthy. A strong foundation is necessary to develop the sport. Towards this end, it is critical to have not only strong age group leagues but vibrant top flight leagues. Kenya needs to get back its One Day International (ODI) status. It will be sad if the talent displayed by the Kenya Under-19 cricket team at the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand is left to go to waste.
