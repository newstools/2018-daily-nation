Long serving Co-operative Bank of Kenya head coach Carey Odhiambo has finally quit the team for rivals Equity Bank men's team ahead of the 2018 season. Odhiambo, who is popularly known as 'T-nine' and has been at the helm of the bankers for over two decades, will replace Clay Oduor, who resigned from Equity at the end of last season. According to Odhiambo, who is also the national men's team head coach, the search for a new challenge was the reason for his movement after helping Co-op Bank win four national titles. “I have been at Co-operative Bank of Kenya for so long achieving almost all I could and thus it was time to start somewhere else”, Odhiambo said on Tuesday. “Yes it is true that I am now the Equity Bank men's basketball coach but I am yet to even start recruitment because we must first of all know when the league will kick off so as to set dates for recruitment drive and pre-season”, he said. The experienced Odhiambo, who is also the Kenya Basketball Coaches Commission Secretary, was spotted at the Equity Bank women basketball team bench during the last month's play-offs assisting head coach David Maina. “There is a lot of uncertainty on the league tip-off dates with a section of the federation officials rooting for a September kick-off date, while others are talking of May which makes it very difficult for the clubs to plan," he said. Elsewhere, the newly formed Panthers men's basketball team and Equity Bank women's team clinched the Tom Munyama memorial basketball tournament at Strathmore University grounds last weekend. While Panthers beat Strathmore Blades 54-50 for the men's title, Equity Bank defeated Zetech University 48-36 for the women’s title, with Buru Buru Girls and Upper Hill winning the boys' and girls' category titles.
