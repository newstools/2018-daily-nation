Hi Brenda, I need your advice. I have a girlfriend and we have been together for three years now. But the problem is that when she comes to my house she always switches off her phone and hides it, and only calls when Iâ€™m away. When I find her (on the phone) and ask her who she is talking to, she cries. And yet she talks to men on the phone, and even last time she met her old boyfriend. I wanted to marry this girl. Should I trust her and move on with that plan or leave her and get another lady?  You want to marry a girl who cries in response to you asking what she is doing? Don't be a fool please, because that is where you will go wrong. Trust is the fundamental bedrock of every relationship out there. Listen, I'm not saying you should be allowed to go through her phone or anything like that. Everyone is allowed their privacy. But that shifty cheater behaviour is too shifty a behaviour to ignore. What do you mean she only calls people when you're away? Are you really in a relationship? I am beyond words. If she cannot be open with you, she will be in an open relationship with you. Let her go back to her old boyfriend so you can move on to your next girlfriend. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
