IN GOLD COAST Sandrafelis Chebet and Stacy Ndiwa lead Kenya’s charge to the first gold medal at the Commonwealth Games when the women’s 10,000 metres final comes up from 1.35pm (Kenyan time) at the Carrara Stadium here on Monday. The fledgling cast will be supported by Beatrice Mutai as Kenya seeks to mine its first gold at Gold Coast. It will be Chebet’s senior debut with the junior steeplechase and 3,000 metres silver medallist making a smooth transition into the senior ranks. With a personal best time over the 10,000m of 32 minutes, 41.2 seconds, Chebet is the biggest bet for the gold with Ndiwa, the Commonwealth Youth Games 1,500m champion in 2008, expected to challenge for silver. This race should be Kenya’s highlight on Monday, with the semi-finals in the 400m (Collins Omae, Boniface Mweresa) and 100m (Mark Otieno) also on the Gold Coast menu. Kenya will be hoping for an improved performance in the ring with Elizabeth Andiego taking on Millicent Agboegbelum of Nigeria in the middleweight quarter-finals and Nick Abaka up against Mbachi Kaonga of Zambia in the light heavyweight. In bowling, Cephas Kimwaki Kimani will be up in the men’s singles’ first round at the Broadbeach Bowls Club while Sylvia Brunlehner (50m backstroke) and Issa Mohammed (50m freestyle) back in swimming action. Meanwhile, Jamaica’s Yohan Blake had the words of Usain Bolt ringing in his ears as he dominated the sprints on day one of the Commonwealth Games athletics on Sunday. Despite world athletics chief Sebastian Coe slamming the “obsession” with Bolt, Blake said he was inspired by the now-retired Jamaican showman as he qualified fastest for the 100 metres final.
