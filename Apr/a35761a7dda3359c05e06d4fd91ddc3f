Perennial flash floods have become the order of the day in Suswa area on the Narok-Mai Mahiu Road for the last one week, causing massive traffic jams and inconveniencing motorists. On Friday evening motorists were stranded for several hours as flood waters from the Suswa escarpment and Mt Longonot flowed down the hills to the lower lying area, cutting off the Narok-Nairobi highway. Police sources on the ground reported heavy traffic snarl-upon both sides as motorists wait for the rains to subside. "There is a heavy downpour here and as usual the flash floods have made the section of the road impassable," said the source. MUD The Suswa flash waters suddenly appear along the tarmac, with a lot of debris and mud sometimes when it has not rained heavily and can be deeper and fast moving than they seem. Rains have been pounding the county since last month making movement of vehicles to and from Mai- Mahiu a nightmare. Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) said flooding around Mai Mahiu and Suswa areas had rendered the road dangerous to motorists and other road users. Last Sunday, passengers were stuck at Suswa following heavy downpour that led to flooding in two different spots on the highway. A bus passenger, Mr Moses Obiri, who was travelling from Kisii to Nairobi said they spent an hour waiting for the floods to subside.
