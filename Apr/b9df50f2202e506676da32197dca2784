The government has been urged to set aside funds specifically for youths addicted to drugs in Msambweni. Speaking over the weekend after meeting some of the addicts and officials from the National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada), Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori said the funds will provide financial support to the recovering addicts. YOUNG PEOPLE “The funds will empower them by directing their energy on alternative activities that will positively change  their lives. We must protect and fight for the rights of young people affected by drugs,” he said. Apart from setting aside funds for the addicts, Mr Dori wants the Methodane Clinic at Kombani along the Likoni-Lunga Lunga highway, be moved to Ukunda where there are many drug addicts. He said most of the drug addicts come from poor families and cannot afford daily transport to the facility in Kombani. “We request Nacada and the county government of Kwale to discuss the possibility of moving the centre to Ukunda,” he said. According to Mr Cosmas Maihana, the director of Teens Watch, a lobby that helps in rehabilitation of drug addicts in Kwale, there are at least 7,000 addicts in the county. He said the clinic at Kombani has enrolled 450 drug addicts, giving them a ray of hope to reconstruct their lives. DRUG PEDDLERS Meanwhile, police in Nyandarua County have arrested three suspected drug peddlers in Ol Kalou and recovered bhang from them. Police said one suspect was in possession of 165 rolls of bhang. Another suspect who has been on police radar was described as a supplier of the drug and had 700g. A third suspect was believed to be a customer. Area police boss Wilson Kosgei said the dealers use motorbikes to peddle the drug in Ol Kalou. Additional reporting by Waikwa Maina
