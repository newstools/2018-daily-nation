Tennis Kenya’s dream of having a high-performance training centre at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, has become a reality after visiting International Tennis Federation (ITF) official David Haggerty presided over the ground-breaking ceremony for the Sh1 billion project. President Uhuru Kenyatta wants the project completed within two years instead of five, bringing hope to many talented players and other stakeholders. Tennis Kenya is among the federations that have been allocated land by the government at the expansive MISC for development. Only Football Kenya Federation has, however, developed theirs, through the Fifa Goal Project, while Kenya Golf Union, Roller Skating and Motorsport, are yet to. More land is lined up for sports bodies. TALENTFederations that have been given land at Kasarani should move fast to develop it and install modern facilities if the country is to attain its full potential in sports. For sustainable growth of talent in all disciplines, we need affordable public amenities. Sports such as golf and tennis are expensive owing to high fees levied on membership and use of the respective facilities. Most sporting countries have grown the numbers across the sports disciplines because of diverse public facilities. Federations also ought to also devise ways of raising money instead of depending on State funding. Kenya can easily get medals from other sports other than athletics in competitions like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games if there is seriousness and proper plan in diversification.
