The Nairobi County government has narrowly missed its March revenue target of Sh1.7 billion by nearly Sh160 million after raking in Sh1.54 billion. However, this is an increase from February revenue when City Hall collected slightly over Sh1.4 billion but a decrease from January's Sh1.6 billion earnings. According to JamboPay, the firm contracted by City Hall to digitise its revenue streams, Nairobi County collected Sh1, 539, 600, 000 in March, despite expectation of increased earnings amid traders rush against deadline for license payments and renewals. RECORD Nevertheless, it was in March when City Hall hit all-time daily revenue record after collecting more than Sh120 million on March 29 through the eJijiPAY system, breaking the previous Sh100 million record. Last month, the now suspended county Finance & Planning Executive, Dr Danvas Makori, said that City Hall was targeting Sh1.7 billion revenue after having digitised revenue streams and sealed corruption loopholes. The county raked in Sh571.6 million from land rates, Sh295.6 million from single business permits and Sh141.5 million from unstructured and cess. Other revenue generators included payments for electronic construction permits which brought the county Sh135.1 million, seasonal parking Sh100.6 million, daily parking Sh36.42 million, parking penalties Sh1.64 million and off street parking Sh797, 400. In addition, rent collected from tenants living in houses owned by the county raked in Sh46.87 million, payment for liquor licenses brought in Sh41.1 million while payments for fire extinguishers stood at Sh77.66 million. Bill payments recorded Sh62.28 million, market stalls licenses Sh8.83 million, health permits raked over Sh6.5 million with regularization at Sh443, 600. The County is targeting to automate all its 136 revenue streams by the end of this month with 97 already digitised.   Counties want grants and donor cash be part of the Division of Revenue Bill.
