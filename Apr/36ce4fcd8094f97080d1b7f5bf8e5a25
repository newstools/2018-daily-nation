IN GOLD COAST After the disappointment of losing out on the gold in Monday's women’s 10,000 metres final, Kenya will continue hunting for medals on Tuesday, the country’s busiest day yet at these games. Kenyans will be in action in shooting, athletics, bowling and badminton with campaigns also being launched in cycling, swimming (para), badminton and table tennis. Team Kenya suffered a major blow last night when Winnie Chebet tripped and kissed goodbye to her hopes of clinching the 1,500 metres title. Not even an appeal from Kenya’s head of delegation here, Barnabas Korir, who deemed Chebet to have been tripped, bore fruit. Kenya will now be down to two runners - Mary Wangari, Beatrice Chepkoech – when the final is run from 3.05pm, Kenyan time. Veteran David Kinja, competing in his fifth Commonwealth Games, will also be in action in the cycling individual time trial that will be held at the Currumbin Beachfront from 10am local time (3am Kenyan time). Gurupreet Dhanjal and Gulraaj Sehmi will feature in the men’s 50m rifle prone competition at the Belmont Shooting Centre. Korir was unsettled ruing the absence of top Kenyan runners from these games as Uganda struck its second gold on the track. The Kenyan chef de mission will hope that fortunes change in Tuesday’s programme where Kinja, Mary Wangari and Beatrice Chepkoech should be good bets to medal. “We need to take these (Commonwealth Games) championships seriously,” Korir said after last night’s women’s 10,000m run won by Uganda’s Stella Chesang. “Athletes should try and focus on the Commonwealth Games just like any major championships. These are not small games,” he said, referring to the tradition by many top athletes to skip the Commonwealth action.
