Governors and senators from the 47 counties put aside their busy schedule to compete in football tournament to mark the fifth annual Devolution Conference in Kakamega at the weekend. It was heartbreak for Senate FC, who reached the final only to lose to Council of County Assembly Forum (CAF) 1-0, who emerged eventual winners of the tournament at Bukhungu Stadium on Monday. Harrison Shikuku scored CAF’s winner in the 36th minute following a left wing cross from Stanley Wakibia. Earlier at the same venue, Senate FC had beaten Council of Governors FC 5-0 in the first semi-final to reach the final. Senate FC scorers were Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala (two goals), while Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Kitui Senator Enock Wambua scored a goal each. In the second semi-final match, CAF defeated Ugatuzi FC 2-0 to reach the final. CAF scored via Wakibia and Shikuku. “This is a rare opportunity for us to keep physically fit away from our busy office work. It also enhances unity with our stakeholders,” said Murkomen. “There is abundant football talent in this part of the country. The only way it can be tapped is for us to lead from the front by indulging in the game,” said Lusaka.
