Transport on the Mamboleo-Miwani road has been paralysed after part of the Kambogo-Guba bridge collapsed on Thursday night. The bridge connects Kisumu East and Muhoroni Constituencies. It is also used by trucks transporting cane to Kibos and Chemelil sugar companies. “It rained heavily on Thursday. River Awach burst its banks. We found part of the bridge gone,” Mr Noah Oyu, a resident, said Friday.
