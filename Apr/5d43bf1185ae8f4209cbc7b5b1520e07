President Uhuru Kenyatta was in Bomet County on Wednesday where he officially opened a dental and eye clinic at Tenwek Mission Hospital. Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso said the visit by the Head of State was in line with the provision of universal healthcare which is outlined in the Jubilee administration’s four point development agenda - the Big Four. Deputy President William Ruto was also present during the launch. Tenwek Hospital  was started  by African Gospel Church (AGC) missionaries eight decades ago and grew from a simple clinic with just a nurse to an international referral facility. It now serves a population of about 800,000 people for primary health care. In 2008, it started offering heart surgeries. Dr Laboso said that as much as faith based health facilities are private institutions, they play a central role in delivering quality health to the people. “The government will work closely with the institutions so as to reduce the wide gap in the patient-doctor ratio and ensure affordable health care,” said the governor while handing over equipment and medicine worth Sh 10 million to the hospital after fire destroyed a building at the facility last month. With healthcare being fully devolved, she said her administration has put in place programs towards provision of quality and affordable services to the residents.
