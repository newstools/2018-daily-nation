The Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) has faulted the proposed move by the government to kick out workers’ and employers’ representatives from the board of trustees of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). FKE Executive Director Jacqueline Mugo said the proposed changes as contained in the Miscellaneous Amendment Bill of 2018 which is before the National Assembly will create unnecessary confusion at the fund. At the same time, the FKE boss said removing partners from the board of trustees will interfere with the smooth running of the fund. “The constant effort to remove social partners from the board of trustees is a clear indication that some quarters are usurping powers of NSSF and this will create confusion at the fund,” Ms Mugo said. LABOUR RELATIONSShe was speaking in Nakuru Town on Thursday during the Rift Valley branch Annual General Meeting at Sarova Woodlands Hotel. She said if the amendments are passed by the assembly, they will give powers to the Cabinet secretary for Labour to appoint five people outside the government to the board of trustees. Ms Mugo said the move to introduce the amendments is a contravention of international labour relations. “Kenya is a signatory of the International Labour Organisation conventions, which are domesticated in our Constitution.” She said that globally, labour matters are managed in a tripartite manner. “Why introduce this drama that would lead to confusion at the fund?” she asked. She also said FKE is concerned over the ongoing university lecturers’ strike.   Mr Atwoli said the only interests he has at NSSF is to advocate for proper governance.
