Contractors demanding payments for services to City Hall have until April 30 to file their claims. A special committee on pending bills led by former anti-graft czar, PLO Lumumba, asked the contractors to provide all documents related to their claims afresh to facilitate scrutiny and processing of payments. A notice to the creditors signed by the committee’s secretary Leboo ole Morintat and Prof Lumumba said the documents should comprise details of services offered, work done or goods delivered as well as disclose any payments made. Some of the claims reportedly go back 20 years. Contractors are required to tender copies of letters of award, acceptance and completion certificate, contract, service level agreements, local purchase and services orders as well as bills of quantities. “Include copies of delivery notes, demand notes, interim payment certificates, fee notes, invoices and any document showing either concluded (proceedings, judgement, decree, warrants or ongoing litigation or petition) over the claim,” the notice reads.

At the same time, Mr Sonko pledged to make public findings of the committee within the next three months.
