IN GOLD COAST Kenya’s sevens rugby team has blamed fatigue and injuries to their lack of progression into medal contention here on Saturday. Kenya started off well, defeating Canada 26-10, but could not offer any answers to New Zealand who mauled “Shujaa” 40-7, leaving Innocent Simiyu’s boys with the dead rubber 47-0 demolition of Zambia as solace. Arthur Owira reportedly broke his leg with the Kenyan camp battling numerous injuries and with only the group winners progressing to the semi-finals (unlike in the IRB World Sevens Series where who go through to the quarters), Kenya’s hopes went up in smoke with the New Zealand hammering at Robina Stadium. “We really wanted to medal at this tournament, however, the match against New Zealand really dented our chances,” veteran Collins Injera said. Skipper Oscar Ouma regretted the injuries. “It’s hard to play well with only seven healthy players,” he said. Collins Injera injured his right arm triceps, Samuel Oliech suffered a concussion while Willy Ambaka got a knock, adding to Kenya’s woes. “When you don’t have key players like Collins and Oliech, it affects the game a lot,” the coach said. Elsewhere, Kenyan cyclists had a difficult day out in the road race. They finished 19th (Suleiman Kangangi, 3:57.58) and 39th (Salim Kipkemboi, 3:59.39) while David Kinja and Peter Gathere did not finish. Mark Inguyesi lost to England’s Syerus Eslami in the men’s 86kg category as Kenya continued to struggle in the “fringe” sports at these games.
