Swaziland King Mswati III’s eighth wife, Ms Senteni Masango, has committed suicide, local media confirmed. “The king’s wife is believed to have overdosed on about 40 amitriptyline capsules – widely used to block the long-term (chronic) pain of some rheumatic conditions and treat depression and related disorders,” online publication News24 reported. Ms Masango – known as Inkhosikati LaMasango –was found dead early on Friday morning. She was buried on Sunday morning. King Mswati III chose Ms Masango as his eighth bride in September 1999, when she was 18. It soon emerged she had a record for truancy, poor grades and she was a high-school dropout and a rebel. Last year, King Mswati III, married his latest bride, Ms Siphelele Mashwama, who was aged 19 years.
