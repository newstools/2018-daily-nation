Two MPs have called for a thorough investigation into the death of a student at Alliance High School on Friday last week. Mr Johana Ng’eno (Emurua Dikirr) and his Nandi Hills colleague Alfred Keter, said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Education ministry should investigate the death of Aaron Kemboi. 'NEGLIGENCE' “The boy died under unclear circumstances. It could be another Kenyatta National Hospital saga pointing to the negligence on the part of the school’s management,” said Mr Ng’eno, who has been paying school fees for the student. The MPs also called upon the National Assembly’s Education committee to carry out its own investigation. The school has, however, denied claims of negligence. Speaking during the requiem mass for the student, who died on Friday, chief principal William Mwangi said Kemboi first visited the school sanatorium after complaining of chest pains on January 10. “On February 28, he went back to the sanatorium, but this time around he mentioned there was blood when he coughed. The next day, he was taken to Kikuyu Hospital and he tested positive for tuberculosis, after which he was put on medication,” he said, adding that the student returned to school, but developed breathing complications and was taken to hospital on Thursday and admitted. Public health officials are today expected to release a report following TB tests on his classmates.   Haroun Kipngeno Kemboi died on Friday.
