MUNICH Holders Real Madrid took control of their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich as goals from Marcelo and Marco Asensio sealed a scrappy 2-1 first-leg win at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. Bayern dominated the first half and took a 28th-minute lead through Joshua Kimmich, but Marcelo levelled against the run of play shortly before the interval with a thunderous strike. Visiting coach Zinedine Zidane sent on Asensio at half-time, and the winger grabbed the winner as Real moved a step closer to a third straight European crown.
