IN GOLD COAST World Champion Elijah Manangoi led compatriot Timothy Cheruiyot to yet another 1-2 in the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games 1500m final at the Carrara Stadium on Saturday. In a replica of the World Championships in London, the two Kenyan completed a 1-2 sweep of the medals after leading from the start. Interestingly, the 1500m final was the final individual track event for the 2018 'Club' Games and the Kenyan brought the curtains down in style after clocking 3:34.78, with Cheruiyot trailing in 3:35.17. Scotland's Jake Wightman was third in 3:35.97 as the last Kenyan in the race, World Junior Champion Kumari Taki, finished seventh in 3:38.74. Coming moments after Hellen Obiri had led Margaret Kipkemboi to another 1-2 sweep of the medals in the women's 5,000m final, Manangoi - Team kenya's captain at the Games - was under pressure to deliver the gold and made no mistake. There were national records for India' Jinson Johnson (3:37.86) who finished fifth and Gibraltar's Harvey Dixon who clocked 3:43.84 to wind 11th. Managoi's gold moved Kenya to 13th on the medal standings, with four gold, seven silver and six bronze. More to follow...   The other Kenyan in the race Eva Cherono was seventh but managed a new personal best of 15:36.10.
