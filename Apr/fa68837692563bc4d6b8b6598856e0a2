Kajiado families whose animals were seized by Tanzanian officials have been compensated by the government. Deputy President William Ruto on Monday issued a cheque of Sh56 million to the 22 families that lost 1,325 animals. “The government sympathises with the families. It is also our resolve to maintain good relations with Tanzania,” Mr Ruto said at Oltiasika grounds in Kajiado South Sub-County. He praised the families for their patience. “I ask the beneficiaries to restock and start other projects,” Mr Ruto added. PILOT PROJECT The deputy president said the government had launched a pilot project on livestock insurance in eight counties. The meeting was attended by Governor Joseph ole Lenku and MPs Katoo ole Metito, George Sunkuyia and Janet Teiya. “Families, especially those in arid areas, lose their animals during dry seasons. It is because of this that we have come up with the insurance policy,” the Deputy President said. MONEY Mr Metito said the money would be deposited in the families’ bank accounts. At the same time, the leaders said the agreement between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga had nothing to do with the 2022 elections. They said the pact was meant to unite Kenyans and accelerate development across the country.   1,400 head of cattle belonging to Maasai from Loitokitok confiscated and auctioned.
