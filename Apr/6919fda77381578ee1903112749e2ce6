White House Academy boys' and girls' handball teams are targeting nothing short of the the title when the National Secondary schools Term One Games kick off next Tuesday in Embu. The Voi-based school, which broke into the lime light last year when they shocked seasoned teams among them former national champions Shimba Hills Girls to win the Coast Region girls' handball title, believe being together for close to six years has helped them get the much needed chemistry . Team coach Roman Jembe believes the boys and girls though small in size, have what it takes to rule the National showpiece for years to come, if their current form and the fact that a majority of the players are in form two is anything to go by. “These boys and girls have been together since class five when they started playing this game and all of them graduated into secondary school last year together which gives us a big advantage over our opponents since we have the much needed experience," Jembe said. White House Girls' team made their debut at last year's Nationals in Mombasa and just missed out on a semi-final slot on goal difference. They are determined to break into the medal bracket this year. “At last year’s games, we were still very new and naïve and completely failed to match the speed and composure of our opponents, but we have now come of age and should be able to effectively compete," he said. According to Jembe, who is also the boys' team coach, beating seasoned teams like Shimo la Tewa and Barani, who were defending the regional title was not a mean achievement, arguing that the boys are determined to leave a mark at this year’s games. The girls' team, which will be making a second straight appearance in Embu consists of Selina Mwamsae, Naomi Randu, Immaculate Baya, Purity Adagi, Pamela Lauzi and Jackline Kariuki among others, while the boys' team will have Edigar Mlamba, Samson Nzai, Joseph Mwende, Daniel Juma, Benson Mwake, James Konde, Fidelix Metui, Kennedy Mwaro and Harrison Kinyanjui among others.
