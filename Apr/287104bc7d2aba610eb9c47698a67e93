One person died while four others were seriously injured after a 14-seater matatu collided head-on with a truck on Saturday evening. The accident occurred near Njuri Boys High School along Chuka-Nairobi highway in Tharaka-Nithi County.    The matatu, belonging to Luxury Tours and Travellers company, was heading to Meru from Nairobi when it collided head-on with a truck. Speaking to the Nation, Tharaka-Nithi County Police Commander Kegode Kidiavai said the driver of the truck, which was transporting cabbages, hit the matatu after losing control. SERIOUS INJURIES “We lost the conductor of the truck while four people, including drivers of the two vehicles, sustained serious injuries,” said Mr Kidiavai. He said the injured were rushed to Chuka County Referral Hospital, while the vehicles were towed to Chuka police station. Mr Kidiavai appealed to drivers using the Meru-Nairobi road to be cautious. He also asked drivers carrying goods to stop overloading in order to avoid losing control of the vehicles when negotiating the corners. “We can minimise the number of accidents if we observe traffic rules,” said the county police boss. Mr John Mutegi, a resident who witnessed the accident, said it took them time to rescue the injured, especially the matatu driver from the wreckage. “We had to use an axe to cut the wreckage to remove the driver of the Nissan matatu who was trapped in the cabin,” said Mr Mutegi.   Six of the hurt are students of Egoji Teachers Training College.
