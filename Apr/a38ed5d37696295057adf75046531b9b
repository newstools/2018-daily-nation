The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) will review its constitution on nominations in a bid to ensure that county assemblies have competent representatives. National Chairman and Suba South MP John Mbadi said the current policies guiding nominations have led to selection of unqualified MCAs. Speaking during a fundraiser in aid of Sango Sango Mixed Secondary School in Ndhiwa Constituency, Homa Bay County, Mr Mbadi said the party has noted the loophole with concern. “I have noted that some MCAs were nominated because they were personal assistants to some party officials but they have no idea of their roles in the county assembly. We are going to do away with such a practice in the expected review,” Mr Mbadi said. Some of the ward representatives who attended the event: Ellyphalet Osuri (Ruma Kaksingri), Juma Awuor (Homa Bay Town East) and Joan Ogada (Kojwach) concurred with Mr Mbadi’s sentiments, saying the current situation has affected service delivery. However, County Assembly Majority Leader Richard Ogindo differed with Mr Mbadi, asking him to concentrate only on national issues. “We respect Mr Mbadi so much as our minority leader in the National Assembly. However, he should desist from meddling in local politics,” Mr Ogindo said. Mr Ogindo said loyalty to the party should be the biggest prerequisite in nominating MCAs. “It is not true that most MCAs in our county assemblies are ineffective. Their loyalty to the party is also an asset,” he said, earning support from more than 30 ward representatives.
