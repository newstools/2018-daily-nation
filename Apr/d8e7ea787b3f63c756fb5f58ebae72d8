Political tension has dramatically eased since President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga shook hands recently. The duo appears to be forging ahead with clear signs that something big could be in the offing. But there is also suspicion in some quarters. Part of the answer has come out with the unveiling of 14 prominent Kenyans to work out a concrete path to national healing and unity. RESPECTED ELDERS This is a solid team comprising respected elders and professionals who would be motivated by nothing but the pursuit of the best for the country. However, it does not explain how this group was arrived at. Indeed, the acrimonious elections of last year left the country sharply divided. However, the push for national dialogue calls for more inclusive consultations. Because of the apparent secrecy around the deal, there has been some grumbling in the two leaders’ camps. President Kenyatta has conceded that some people in his own corner are uneasy about the step he has taken, which has been linked to the 2022 succession politics. COLLAPSE Mr Odinga has had to contend with the imminent collapse of Nasa, the coalition that backed his presidential bid in the last elections, while Deputy President William Ruto’s lieutenants allege a plot against him. The success of this initiative will depend on openness and wider consultations to ensure inclusiveness.
