Heavy rain was causing major problems on the Narok-Maai Mahiu highway Monday night, police said. The busy highway was gridlocked for hours in Suswa as police advised motorists to use alternative routes to and from Nairobi. A motorist at the scene told Nation that deluge has blocked the road at near the SGR construction site. OCS TRAPPED Narok police boss Joseph Kisompe said among the motorists stuck in the traffic is Ntulele OCS Muthee Nyaga. On Sunday, hundreds of motorists were stranded for several hours as flood waters from upper areas cut off the highway. According to Mr Kisompe, many motorists spent the night in their cars. "There was a downpour last night and as usual, flash floods made sections of the (Narok-Maai Mahiu) road impassable," said Mr Kisompe. Transport on the road has been disrupted more than six times this year following heavy rains pounding most parts of the country.   National Police Service says efforts to clear the debris are underway.
