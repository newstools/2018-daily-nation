Deputy President William Ruto on Friday hit out at Kirinyaga leaders over infighting after a section of locals heckled Governor Anne Waiguru during his visit of the county. DP Ruto visited the county to launch construction of two roads but was forced to control a section of locals who were bent on shouting down the county boss as grassroots divisions played out. At Kerugoya, he launched 100km Gakoigo- Njegas stretch of roads and promised more projects in coming months. His speech at Kerugoya was briefly interrupted as youth chanted “Waiguru must go”, forcing DP Ruto to calm the youth. “We agreed to have a unified nation not what we hear coming from Kirinyaga. We do not want to hear fracas and insults coming from this county,” DP Ruto said. The function was attended by local and Jubilee leaders from the Central region among them the Kirinyaga governor, Women Representative Wangui Ngirici and her Murang’a counterpart Sabina Chege, Senator Charles Kibiru among a contingent of members of Parliament. However, only the Deputy President addressed the residents. DP Ruto warned that internal divisions were hurting Jubilee Party's Big Four agenda. “All Kirinyaga leaders are members of Jubilee. We should not be fighting ,rather we should focus on delivering to the people what we promised them. It is time to work and not play politics,” DP Ruto remarked. He urged local politicians who were opposing incumbents to wait until 2022 and respect leaders in office. “Every political seat is taken and everybody should respect that. Wait until 2022 and the people will decide whether the current leaders will have delivered or not,” he said.The DP also remained coy on 2022 presidential succession politics, saying he would decide what will happen when the time is right. Pushed by the crowd to reveal who would deputise him  he said: “I know 2022 is a weighty issue but we will know when that time comes.   DP Ruto said the program will be launched next month.
