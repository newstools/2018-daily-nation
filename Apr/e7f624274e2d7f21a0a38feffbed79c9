IN GOLD COAST Uganda's former world junior champion Joshua Cheptegei struck gold in an explosive 5,000 metres final at the Carrara Stadium here as Edward Zakayo added a bronze for Kenya to the one won earlier in the day by Samuel Gathimba in the walk on Sunday. The East African rivalry, that had reached a deafening crescendo at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Kampala last year, where the Kenyans obliterated Uganda on their Kampala home turf at the Kololo grounds, was played out again with the Ugandans taking the early initiative and calling the shots with four laps to go.     Cheptegei then surged forward at the bell and had to fight off the challenge of hitherto unheralded Canadian Ahmed Mohammed who battled for silver behind the Ugandan, with Zakayo holding on for third. Cheptegei's winning time was 13 minutes, 50.83 seconds with Mohammed timed at 13:52.78. Zakayo's time was 13:54.06.   The other two Kenyans Nicholas Kipkorir and David Kiprotich were ninth and 11th respectively. "I think we came here (to Gold Coast) too early," Bett said. Cheptegei said after his tactical blunder coast him victory at Kololo last year, he's been on a mental and physical journey.   "After that disappointment, I had to go back, focus mentally and physically and here I am now. Its not been easy," said the Ugandan who is managed by Netherlands-based Global Sports Communications company, that also handles Kenyan stars Geoffrey Kamworor and Eliud Kipchoge. Zakayo, a form three student at the athletics-mad Kapsait Secondary School said he was happy with his first senior medal after his 3,000m silver in last year's IAAF World Under-18 Championships in Nairobi.   "We had planned to attack Cheptegei as a team but on the last lap, when I looked behind, I didn't see anyone and that's when I attacked but it was too late," Zakayo said. "Nine days before the race was too early as we lost the benefits of altitude. The Ugandans arrived just two days ago."   In the men's hammer throw, meanwhile, Kenya's Dominic Ondigi hurled a national record 61.38 metres but still finished last in the field of 16. England's Nick Miller won gold with a games record 80.26m with Australia's Matty Denny second with a personal best 74.88m and Scotland's Mark Dry took bronze in 73.12m, also a PB.
