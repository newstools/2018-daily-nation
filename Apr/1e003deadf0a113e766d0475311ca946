The government has suspended resettlement at Mwea scheme, a day after five people were shot and injured during confrontations with the police. The suspension follows consultations between cabinet secretaries Farida Karoney (Lands) and Fred Matiang’i (Interior). The ministerial decision was announced by Interior spokesman Mwenda Njoka on Thursday. “The Government has suspended with immediate effect the resettlement exercise that has been going on in Mwea area of Kirinyaga and Embu counties,” he said in his official twitter account. GUNSHOT WOUNDS Five people were on Wednesday admitted with gunshot wounds after they were injured during confrontations that marred the exercise. The police were deployed to guard the 44,000-acre settlement scheme. Those injured were in a group that tried to block others who had been allocated pieces of land from accessing their parcels. Mr Abednego Mutua, 41, was shot in the stomach. Others are Mr Pius Musau, 40, (chest), Mr Dennis Muriithi, 20, (hand and stomach) and Mr Kennedy Muvevi Mutua, 21, who was also shot in the stomach. Mr Boniface Nzioka Manyuoli, 19, had a bullet lodged in his thigh. INJURED Most of the injured were rushed to White Rose Medical Centre and Gategi Satellite hospital. On Wednesday, hundreds of youths started pelting police with stones at Mashamba, prompting the shootout.   An eye witness said one of victim's hand had been chopped off.
