Villagers in Nyahera, Kisumu County, have lynched a man they accused of murdering a boda boda operator. Before hacking the suspect, Mr Nick Ageng’o, to death and setting his body on fire on Wednesday morning, the irate residents torched the suspect’s hut and destroyed all crops on his farm. The incident came just few hours after the burial of Mr Jacktone Otieno, 19, whom the residents claimed, was killed by the suspect’s younger brother Mr Fredrick Ageng’o, who is at large. The villagers said the two suspects, Nick and Fredrick, were responsible for many robberies and deaths in the area. NURSING INJURIES “The two brothers are a headache to the entire Nyahera village; many people are nursing injuries caused by them and their colleagues,” said Mr Wycliffe Abuto, a resident. During the Wednesday incident, the residents said Mr Nick Ageng’o ambushed Mr Walter Otieno at about 3am and hit him with a blunt object before slashing him with a machete. They said they found Mr Otieno lying in a pool of blood at Kiboswa trading centre before rushing him to Nyahera Health Centre where he later succumbed to his injuries. DISAGREEMENT The residents said that on Tuesday evening, the suspect had threatened Mr Otieno of ‘dire consequences’ following a disagreement. Kisumu West OCPD Wilstone Mwakio said they had launched investigations. “It is unfortunate that the villagers killed the suspect,” said Mr Mwakio. But the residents, who accused the police of laxity, said that even after reporting the suspects on several occasions, no action had been taken against them.
