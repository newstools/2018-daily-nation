Kibera Black Stars will be out to pile pressure on table toppers Western Stima when they visit Nairobi Stima on Sunday in a National Super League match in Naivasha. Western Stima stayed atop the NSL standings after their 4-1 rout of Administration Police (AP) in Kisumu on Wednesday, but the former top flight side will not be in action this weekend. The Kisumu-based side tops the table on 23 points from 10 matches, with Black Stars three adrift in second place. However, Black Stars will need to win convincingly against Nairobi Stima at Old Trafford in Naivasha to dislodge Western Stima. “We shall try as much as possible to score enough goals to help us dislodge Western Stima from the top. But the most important thing is to bag the three points. We respect our opponents, but we will work hard to get the maximum points,” said Black Stars coach Godfrey Oduor. Third-placed Kenya Police FC visit Nakuru All Stars at Afraha in Nakuru as they hunt for points that will see them close in on top spot. Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) face Administration Police away while Modern Coast Rangers will play Ushuru at the newly build Bomu Stadium in Mombasa.
