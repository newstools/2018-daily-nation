The latest grave threat to national food security is being posed by a little pest, which is notorious for its fast devastation of crops. The Fall Armyworm has since last year been wreaking havoc in the country’s North Rift grain basket. And quite alarming now are reports of attacks in central Kenya and at the coast. Unless its march is stopped, it could spell doom. STARVATIONExperts are warning that the slow response to the armyworm invasion could soon lead to massive starvation around the country. While a severe drought in the arid and semi-arid lands during most of last year resulted in livestock deaths, and left the people on the verge of starvation, this pest is ravaging the breadbasket. The Agriculture ministry’s admission that it does not have reliable data on the devastation of farms and the likely impact on national food production targets is not helping matters. MAIZE We have a grave situation on our hands. First sighted in the country in 2016, the armyworm infestation had by March last year resulted in the loss of more than a million bags of maize, or 20 per cent of the total national crop yield. This is unacceptable, since ensuring food security remains a big challenge. There is a need for a concerted national effort not just to stop the pest’s spread, but also to wipe it out in the places where it has gained ground.
