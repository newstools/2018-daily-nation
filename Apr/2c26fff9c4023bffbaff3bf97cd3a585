Tension is high in Archers Post on the Samburu-Isiolo–Laikipia border after four people, among them three police officers, were shot dead on Wednesday evening while tracking stolen goats. Seven other officers sustained serious injuries. A peace crusader who had accompanied the police was also killed in the ambush. According to Samburu County police commander Alfred Ageng’o, the officers were ambushed by people suspected to be cattle rustlers. "We lost three police officers in the attack. More security personnel have been deployed to the area to pursue the assailants," Mr Ageng’o said. Two of those killed were attached to Wamba police station whereas one was from Archers Post. The injured officers are recuperating at a hospital in Isiolo County. A similar attack occurred on October 2012 in Suguta Valley where 42 police officers lost their lives.
