PUBLIC SCHOOLS Data from the Ministry of Education indicate that 7,691,448 learners have been registered in public schools, while private schools have registered 1,824116, giving a total of 9,515,564. The government is targeting to register about 12million learners. “The Ministry wishes to inform schools that going forward, cash disbursements for the Free Primary Education Programme, Free Day Secondary Education Programme and the KCPE and KCSE Examinations Registration Fee payments for candidates will be based on the Nemis platform,”  said Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed. She added: “We therefore encourage schools to continuously accurately update their student and staff data to the Nemis environment. So far, she said, the ministry was impressed by the progress made in uploading data of learners and teaching and non-teaching staff in schools. The government provides Sh14billion for free primary education and Sh32 billion for free secondary education. TRANSITION However, with 100 per cent transition to secondary schools, the government has since increased capitation to secondary schools. For primary schools, the government pays Sh1, 420 per child per year, while in secondary schools, it pays Sh22, 244 per child. The system was launched on January 27 this year to register all learners in primary and secondary schools. But the process was extended in February after it became imperative that on a small number of learners had been registered due to the slow process of issuing birth certificates, especially at the primary school level. “It has been noted that the process has been slowed down since most learners were yet to acquire birth certificates that were required for the registration,” Ms Amina said. FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS “To this end, the Ministry of Education has had fruitful discussions with the Ministry of Interior and National Coordination of Government on ways to fast-track the process of issuing birth certificates.” Ms Mohamed urged all schools to ensure that they enrol their learners into the Nemis system. In the meantime, she said the ministry would continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that all concerns arising from the process are adequately addressed to facilitate a smooth implementation of Nemis. The CS cited one of the challenges of the system as the difficulty in accessing birth certificates for most learners especially for in rural areas. She said, since the registration started, the ministry has been addressing arising issues reported by schools. BIRTH CERTIFICATES “The challenge of getting birth certificates for learners is being addressed to ensure there is 100 per cent registration,” said Ms Mohamed. Ms Mohamed said the system would remain open to ensure that there is continuous registration of students reporting in schools. The CS however, says there has been a low registration for learners in the Early Childhood Development (ECD) centers. She said so far, only 1,787 pupils have been registered. FUNDS “We continue to encourage parents to get the necessary documents to enable schools to register all learners,” said Ms Mohamed. Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association Chairman Kahi Indimuli said they would use the added time to register all students. “We are doing our best to register students since this number is critical for school funds disbursement,” said Mr Indimuli. Kenya Private Schools Association Chief Executive Peter Ndoro said they would ensure that all children are registered. County Name Total Learners 1.Kiambu 447,664 2.Nairobi 447,370 3.
