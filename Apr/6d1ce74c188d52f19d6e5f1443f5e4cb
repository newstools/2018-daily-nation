A spirited fightback by Kenya fell short as Australia notched their first win at Hong Kong Sevens on Saturday with a 28-26 win over Innocent Simiyu's charges. Kenya, already through to the Cup quarters after their opening two wins over Canada and Spain, put up a lacklustre show against Australia but still stopped Pool "B". Tries from Ian Minjire, Eden Agero, Billy Odhiambo and Andrew Amonde failed to spur Kenya, who committed basic mistakes to lose to the Australia Sevens champions. Earlier victories against Canada (33-10) and Spain (26-0) were enough to put Kenya Sevens through alongside Spain. SPAIN'S FAIRYTALE RUN Spain continued with their fairytale run, stunning Canada 12-0 to qualify alongside Kenya from the pool for the Cup quarterfinals. Spain shocked Australia 17-12 on day one on Friday. Kenya and Spain had seven points each but Kenya topped on superior aggregate. Awful mistakes at kick-off and restart saw Kenya trail 14-0 with Jeral Skelton and Dylan Pietch scoring for Australia inside the opening two minutes. Minjire and Agero scored after good assists from Jeffrey Oluoch and Collins Injera before Agero added the extras to level 14-14 at the break. Kenya's defence was slippery in their tackles in the middle to gift Luchie Miller two quick tries that saw Australia lead 28-14. OYOO SEES RED Substitutes Odhiambo and Nelson Oyoo breathed some life into Kenya's attack with Odhiambo scoring as Kenya reduced the deficit at 28-19. Oyoo was to be red carded for a high tackle but Kenya still got a try through Andrew Amonde. Kenya had an opportunity to win the match but fumbled with their passes in Australia's 22m area to lose possession. Kenya will meet the second-placed team in Pool "C" that has South Africa, England and Scotland.   Team beats a much-improved Spain 26-0 in the World Rugby Sevens Series.
