Home professional Nicholas Rokoine carded level par 71 on the tough playing Muthaiga Golf club course, to claim the top prize in the Kenya Golf Union (KGU) Chairman’s prize on Friday morning. Rokoine needed two shots at the front nine, an equal number at the back nine with birdies at the ninth, 11th and 12th and at the 14th holes to beat Golf park’s Tony Omulli by two shots. Omuli, who said the front nine was still as tough as during the Kenya Open, started with a double bogey at the par four-first hole. He also bogeyed the par three-second and the fifth. He, however, made two back-to-back birdies at the third and fourth before dropping a shot at the fifth. “The greens are still firm while the rough is unforgiving," said Omuli who recovered with two more birdies at the back nine’s 10th and 15th after dropping one at the eighth and a late bogey at the 16th for two over par 73. Another Muthaiga pro Jeff Kubwa and Sigona’s John Wangai tied on three over par 74. A total of 22 pros turned up for the event and played for a Sh150,000 purse courtesy of out going Kenya Golf Union (KGU) chairman Richard Wanjalla. The big field of more than 150 amateurs was still however on the course battling it out for the various prizes in the Nation Media Group sponsored tournament on Friday evening.
