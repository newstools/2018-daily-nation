Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria has rolled out mass registration of patients with chronic ailments for free National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) cover under the Universal Healthcare programme. His administration aims to register 35,000 people with chronic diseases in order to bring drugs near them for free. County Universal Healthcare Coordinator Grace Wairimu said registration officers have been posted at every dispensary where the drugs will be placed to ensure that those registered get the drugs. “We aim to register about 2,500 in each sub-county and to place the drugs they require in their home dispensaries so that they don’t have to walk long distances to get the medicine,” Ms Wairimu said. She noted many people in the county suffer from diabetes, arthritis, and high blood pressure, among other chronic diseases, which prompted the governor to launch the initiative. She noted that chiefs have played an important role in mobilising the community to register, adding that by Friday last week, Kangema and Kigumo sub-counties had registered more than 5,000 patients in dire need of drugs and treatment.
