LOS ANGELES Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue will resume duties at courtside later on Thursday after recovering from his recent health concerns. Lue has spent nearly three weeks on the sidelines after the latest in a series of health alerts forced him to leave the Cavs' win over the Chicago Bulls last month. "I'm just happy to be back," Lue told reporters on Thursday at the Cavs' practice ahead of their game against the Washington Wizards. Lue, 40, has been plagued by health concerns all season. As well as leaving last month's game against the Bulls, he also returned to the locker room during a game against Orlando in February. He also sat out a game against the Bulls in December citing health concerns. Lue revealed in a statement last month that he was taking a break from coaching duties after revealing he had been suffering mystery chest pains. The Cavs have gone 8-1 under associate head coach Larry Drew since Lue temporarily stepped aside last month. The Cavaliers are currently third in the Eastern Conference standings, running neck and neck with Philadelphia in a battle for the third seeding in the playoffs.
