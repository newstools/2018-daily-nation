Residents of Musasa and Manzale villages in Vihiga County were on Thursday shocked after finding a decomposing male body in Kibiri forest off the busy Chavakali-Kapsabet Road. County Police Commander Beatrice Gachago said the police were alerted by the residents when they saw the body. “The body was found by a herdsboy who was grazing cattle in the the forest,” said Ms Gachago. Ms Gachago said the body had bruises on the face and stomach and preliminary probe indicated that the deceased was likely killed elsewhere and dumped in the forest. The clothes the deceased wore were badly torn, an indication that he was dragged to the forest by his assailants. The body has been transferred to Vihiga County Referral Hospital mortuary for a postmortem. Ms Gachago said the deceased’s fingerprints will be used to identify him.   Ms Joyce Auma was buried two years ago in Nyakach, Kisumu County.
