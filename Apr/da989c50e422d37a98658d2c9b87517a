Two people have been killed and seven others injured after armed men raided Salima village in Marsabit County, on Wednesday morning. Marsabit County Commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo said that the attackers, who appeared to be on a revenge mission, were searching for weapons stolen from them last month. “The attackers were looking for a gun that was stolen from them during an incident where a man was murdered a month ago,” said Mr Kitiyo. The incident comes only three days after three members of a family were killed during a clash between two communities. THREE KILLED Mr Kitiyo said the three were killed at Ol-Turot village, of Laisamis sub county. “The attackers might have been on a revenge mission since they did not steal anything,” said Mr Kitiyo. Mr James Lolima, a resident, said tension was rising in Salima after the attack. “Unknown people have been spotted in the bush, we do not know what they are planning; Salima village residents are fleeing to Loiyangalani town following the attack,” Mr Lolima told the Nation. SECURITY He said the raid began on Wednesday morning before the villagers rallied to defend themselves. Mr Kitiyo said more police officers had been sent to the region to beef up security. “We have sent police officers from Marsabit and GSU team from Baragoi to help calm the situation,” said Mr Kitiyo.   During the dawn attack a woman and her two children were shot dead.
