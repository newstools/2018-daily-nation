IN GOLD COAST With the Prince of Wales in attendance, England obliged by throwing down the gauntlet and leading the medals table of the opening day of action at the 21st Commonwealth Games here on Friday. The English raked in a total of 12 medals made up of six gold, three silver and as many bronze as hosts Australia followed with 15 (5-4-6) and Malaysia were a surprise third with two gold medals, both from weightlifting. England’s triumphed in swimming (four gold), track cycling and artistic gymnastics while the hosts won two in the pool and three in track cycling. Kenya hopes to lighten up the mood in camp with three boxers from the national team’s “Hit Squad” in the ring on Friday from 6.47am, Kenyan time, at the Oxenford Studios. Heavyweight (91kg) Elly Ajowi will be first up against Scotland’s Scott Forrest in the round of 16 fight at 6:47am before Shaffi Hassan takes on Namibia’s Matias Hamunyela in the light flyweight (46-49kg) round of 16 from 11:32am. Then there is the interesting 12:17pm middleweight (75kg) pairing of Tanzanian Selemani Kidunda and Kenya’s Edwin Owuor Okong’o (Kenya) in the round of 32. Interesting because Kidunda is coached by a Kenyan, Musa Benjamin, who, ironically, sharpened Okong’o’s skills at Nairobi’s St Theresa’s Boxing Club. Eunice Mbugua will be back in the lawn bowls competition, up against Canada’s Kelly McKerihen in the women’s singles’ section ‘C’ fourth round from 5am, Kenyan time. Winnie Langat competes in the 58-kilogramme category in weightlifting, while a full day awaits the swimmers.   Khaaliqa lost to Nikki Todd (Canada) in straight games (11-4, 11-8, 11-7).
