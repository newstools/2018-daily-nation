Businesspeople in Nakuru reaped big from a four-day conference by Ministry of Repentance and Holiness Church Prophet David Owuor. The conference, which took place at the church at Nakuru showground, attracted followers from all over the country. BOOM Hotel owners, hawkers, water vendors, and makeshift hotels recorded a boom. Mr Elijah Mwangi, a tout within Nakuru Town, said he switched to selling beverages outside the church for the four days. He said he made Sh5,000 in a day as the faithful flocked his makeshift shop for refreshments. “I have been camping here for the four days selling soda and water to the faithful attending the conference. I have not gone home since I have been doing this both during the day and night,” said Mr Mwangi. FULLY BOOKED A spot-check by the Nation showed that most of the hotels in Nakuru Town were fully booked from as early as Monday. “Some of them started making reservations a week ago and by Thursday we had all our spaces booked,” said Mr David Kariuki, a hotel operator within the town. Others who recorded a boom from the conference are boda boda and tuk-tuk operators who ferried the faithful from one location to another. “I took the opportunity to supply water to the people preparing food here because there is no water and I have been selling 100 jerrycans per day,” said Mr Eric Omosa, a water vendor. The conference came to a close on Sunday evening.
