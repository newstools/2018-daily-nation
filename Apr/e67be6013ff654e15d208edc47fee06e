Many schools in Nakuru, Nyandarua and Narok counties are offering holiday tuition, despite the ban imposed years ago, a spot check by the Nation has revealed. The lessons offered by both secondary and primary schools are conducted in churches, homes and schools. GOVT: No holiday tuition in schools In Nyandarua County, for instance, the Nation established that primary school students are under strict instructions to be in class by 7am, but not wearing school uniform. They are allowed to carry only two books, and in small shopping bags instead of their usual backpacks. MANDATORYThe gates are locked after 7am and hawk-eyed teachers posted at strategic points to monitor the movement of suspicious visitors around the premises. Parents with children in different schools revealed that the lessons are mandatory for students in class seven and eight. They claimed that the schools charge those who refuse to allow their children to attend tuition between Sh350 and Sh1,000. The students have two lessons per day, which end at midday. Nyandarua Central Deputy County commissioner Gideon Oyagi confirmed that he had received the complaints and warned teachers against demanding fees for extra classes. “We have that information and holiday tuition is illegal. We will soon take action against the teachers concerned. They must follow the Ministry of Education’s regulations,” he said. REMEDIAL CLASSESIn Nakuru Town parents collude with teachers to rent premises where tuition is conducted. “Learners do not need so much time at their disposal, a week is enough for them to rest. We are the ones who pay for the tuition,” a parent in Nakuru, who sought anonymity, said. Teachers approached refused to comment but one at a private secondary school in Nakuru said that they were having remedial classes for “weak” students.
