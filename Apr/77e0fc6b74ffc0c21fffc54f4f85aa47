Kenyans online have resorted to publicly shaming teenagers who post semi-nude pictures of themselves on the internet. For the better part of Thursday, social media users shared pictures and videos of teens celebrating "nudity" and posing suggestively with the hope that their parents and guardians will identify them. VIRAL It all started with a video shared by a girl dissing critics who bash young women for posting semi-nude pictures of themselves on the net. The unidentified girl tells haters to mind their business, saying it is her choice to expose her body. “Hawa watu wa katambe kafikie pastor, ikifikia pastor kwani nitafukuzwa church? Like you boys have very stupid aims though. If I decide to show off my body, like it is mine, I will show it off till the day I die. And if you don’t like it b***h die first,” said the girl. The girl’s video quickly went viral through the hashtag #ifikiewazazi. Kenyans started sharing photos of young boys and girls posing suggestively, with some in semi-nude state. Kenyans on Twitter bashed the boys and girls while others sympathised with the level of immorality exhibited by the youth in the society. Most of the images and videos shared on Twitter using the #ifikiewazazi hashtag are too graphic, and some salacious, for the Nation to republish.
