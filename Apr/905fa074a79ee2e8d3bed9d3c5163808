Former Attorney-General Githu Muigai Tuesday defended his record at the State Law Office, saying he did his best, and that he trained and maintained a professional team. Speaking during the handing over ceremony to his successor, Justice Paul Kihara Kariuki, Mr Muigai said: “I am not going to use this function to defend my record but just to say this: every objective historian will say I and my team made every best effort here,” Prof Muigai told journalists at the AG’s Chambers. Prof Muigai, who resigned in February, was responding to a question as to whether he thought he might have lost his job because of his performance at the Supreme Court. In a landmark decision, the court annulled President Uhuru Kenyatta’s election on August 8 last year and ordered a repeat poll after 60 days. “The people in this office, at this table, I can vouch for them personally. And I can do that because I traine d 99 per cent of them personally,” Prof Muigai told Mr Kariuki Meanwhile, Justice Kariuki who was sworn in last week, warned the staff that anyone who breached the Constitution would be sacked. “We must render services led by the Constitution. There will be no room for any officer who falls short of this,” he said, adding  that he expected their full cooperation. “There is a lot of work to be done. I am bit horrified by the number of files I have been shown, but we need to get the work done.” he asserted. Justice Kariuki, the former president of the Court of Appeal, urged the officers to continue with the high standards and traditions set by Prof Muigai during his seven-year tenure.
