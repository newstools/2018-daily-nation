Bishop Joseph Kagunda of the Anglican Church of Kenya’s Mt Kenya West Diocese suffered a setback after the  Labour court refused to enjoin him in a contempt-of-court application filed by three clerics he suspended on allegations of engaging in homosexuality. Archdeacon John Gachau, Rev James Maigua and Rev Paul Warui wanted the church’s  trustees  cited in contempt for disregarding court orders dated September 30, 2016,  ordering their reinstatement. The court also directed that they be paid Sh6.8 million compensation after finding that the allegations against them were not true. Through their lawyer, David Onsare, the clerics went back to court and complained  that the church’s disregarded for the two orders was prolonging their psychological trauma. Mr Onsare told Justice Nzioki Makau that on reporting to Bishop Kagunda for redeployment, the clergymen were not assigned any duties. But Bishop Kagunda, through lawyer Wachira Nderitu, argued that the clerics’ designation in the church had not changed. In addition, Mr Nderitu noted that the church does not have a central structure or authority to whom the clergy are accountable, so the court orders could be effected only through the Mt Kenya West Diocese. The contempt of court ruling will be made on May 15.   Mt Kenya West Bishop Joseph Kagunda accused of linking former priest to homosexuality.
