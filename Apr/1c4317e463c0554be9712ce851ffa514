The face of Nairobi City is set to undergo a major transformation in the next 30 days as Nairobi regeneration team gets to work on various ambitious projects in the capital. This comes after the team leaders committed to ambitious timelines for the delivery of key services, ranging from garbage collection, clean up of Nairobi River to launching of a mortgage company. "The Cabinet secretaries and the Principal secretaries who are part of the team will tender their resignation to President Kenyatta while county executives will hand theirs to Governor Miko Sonko if they fail to deliver,” read a statement from PSCU after the team met President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House on Friday to brief him on the ambitious project. GARBAGE The technical committee co-chaired by Governor Mike Sonko and Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said garbage would be cleared from all the 85 electoral wards in Nairobi within 30 days, and a clean-up of Nairobi River also started. This would come as a relief to most residents as the county has grappled with garbage problems that have turned the city to an eyesore as solid waste litter most parts of the county. It is estimated that Nairobi’s 900, 000 households generate about 2, 500 tonnes of garbage daily with City Hall struggling to cope up with the huge amounts of the waste. HOUSING The other ambitious project that the team comprising of the national and county leaders have committed themselves to is the launch of the Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company, which is at the heart of delivering affordable housing. Under this plan, Nairobi is projected to provide 200,000 new affordable homes.   Government to pay Sh1,350 premium per student for all 3 million public secondary students.
