Dear Brenda, My husband wants me to resign from my job so that I can be at home more yet I make more money than him and even foot some of the bills. He’s being unreasonable in my opinion but he won’t back down from this declaration and it’s causing me endless stress because I love my kids but I also love my job. Please advice me on what to do?  Oh dear. Your husband, you say? That means you're already in quite deep, but never fear, Brenda is here. In short – don't be stupid. This man is trying to control you and your family by giving you even less of a budget to work with than you have now, considering you have responsibilities at home. So unless you're ready to move to a smaller house with no internet and meat once a week, ignore him until he proves he can handle the money-filled vacuum that will be left if you resign. In the meantime, compromise – if you can do flexible hours at work and thus spend a little more time at home, then the better for your relationship and your kids. If not, well...carry on. *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? E-mail: lifeanstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   I’ve been seeing someone for three years and he recently confessed he has a daughter he has never seen since she was born
