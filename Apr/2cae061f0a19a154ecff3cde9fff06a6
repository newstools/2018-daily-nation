Nyali MP Mohamed Ali has pledged to fight drug traffickers in Mombasa. Mr Ali said the National Assembly would soon make changes to the law and increase the fine imposed on a drug trafficker from Sh5 million to Sh30 million. The lawmaker, who was issuing bursary cheques to more than 3,000 students in Kongowea, asked parents to allow him to fight the drug menace. “If you really want to see an end to this problem, do not interfere with my work. If anyone messes up with our children, Mohamed Ali will fight to defend them. We can’t keep complaining about the same matter every year,” he said. “Fighting drugs should be the main agenda of the Mombasa woman representative, ward representatives, the senator and fellow MPs”.
