Chinese firm Transsion Holdings is the Kenyan market leader in the number of mobile phones sold. Three of its brands including Tecno, itel and Infinix are among the top five devices by sales in the country, a survey by Consumer Insight shows. In the survey dubbed Wakenya, the three brands accounted for 54 per cent of phones owned by Kenyans. In 2016 two of the Chinese brands — Tecno and itel — held a 34 per cent share of the market. Of the respondents in the latest survey, 28 per cent owned a Tecno phone, 16 per cent a Samsung, 12 per cent a Nokia and 10 per cent an Infinix. In a separate marketplace report, Jumia indicated that Kenya leads globally in the share of Internet traffic through mobile phones overtaking Nigeria, which was at the top in 2017. The Jumia report further indicated that the high mobile penetration has been driven by the entry of aggressive firms such as Hong Kong-based Transsion Holdings. Transsion, which has a presence in India, is also the largest smartphone company by sales in Africa. Its brands include Tecno and Infinix which dominate the smartphone segment, while Tecno and itel lead the feature phone segment.
