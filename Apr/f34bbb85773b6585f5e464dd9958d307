BARCELONA Luis Suarez's late strike sealed a 4-1 win for Barcelona against Roma in their Champions League quarter-final, first leg on Wednesday to leave the Catalans on the brink of a place in the last four. Lionel Messi was not among the goals on his return to the Barca starting line-up but a pair of own goals from Daniele De Rossi and Kostas Manolas had the hosts in control at the Camp Nou. Gerard Pique made it three, with Edin Dzeko pulling one back before Suarez completed the scoring late on. Roma have a mountain to climb in next Tuesday's return.
