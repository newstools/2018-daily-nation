Kenyan international striker Masoud Juma is eyeing more goals for his new team, Cape Town City in South Africa’s Premier Soccer League (PSL). Juma came off the bench to grab his maiden goal that helped City hold Maritzburg United to a 1-1 draw in a league match on Saturday at Harry Gwala Stadium. Andrea Fileccia shot Maritzburg ahead in the 27th minute but Juma, who replaced Judas Mosemaedi in the 63rd minute, reacted sharply to riffle home a volley from 14 yards, after Craig Martin’s free kick had rebounded off the Maritzburg wall. And with just two league appearances, the former Kariobangi Sharks forward is looking forward to playing more matches after recovering from an ankle injury. “Personally I am happy to have scored my first goal after two games in the PSL. I would like to work harder and score more and help this team, the Citizens,” stated the 2017 Kenyan Premier League (KPL) top scorer in a post-match interview with SuperSport. “We had planned for three points but unfortunately got one. We appreciate because it wasn’t easy. I wish to thank the entire Cape Town City staff who helped me during the three months I was out with injury, their support was amazing,” he recounted. Juma joined the Benni McCarthy-coached side in January from Sharks after a stellar season in the Kenyan Premier League. Formerly at now defunct Kambakia Christian Centre (KCC) in Meru, Juma has overall featured in four City games. City are sixth on the 16-team table with 35 points after 26 rounds.
