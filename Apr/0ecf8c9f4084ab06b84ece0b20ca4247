Pain has become a real curse to the regular users of the Mai Mahiu-Narok road that also leads to the Maasai Mara tourist attraction. Heavy floods have cut off the road several times this year, necessitating emergency repairs. For Narok County, the rains are now synonymous with death and destruction. This naturally raises the question as to whether the people who designed and built this highway got it right in the first place. Couldn’t they have foreseen the threat of flood waters and introduced measures to stem the destruction being witnessed time and again? SOLUTION It’s not surprising, therefore, that frustrated local leaders are frantically searching for a solution to this problem. One is the plan to a 70-kilometre road that links Narok and Kajiado counties as an alternative to the Mai Mahiu-Narok road that gets washed away by heavy rains. This is not a bad idea. However, it does not address the crucial matter of what to do with the main highway as it was built at a substantive cost to the taxpayer. FRUSTRATION We can understand the frustration of the motorists and their passengers who get stranded for many hours. This road is a national resource, whose maintenance is the responsibility of the Kenya National Highways Authority. The agency has the expertise and resources to make it safer and more durable. It should isolate the sections prone to flooding, redesign and rebuild them.
