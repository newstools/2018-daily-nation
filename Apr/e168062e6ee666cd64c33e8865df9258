The Orange Democratic Movement has called for a stakeholder forum to oversee the reconstitution of the embattled electoral commission and its Secretariat. In a statement, ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna blamed the Secretariat for the annulled August 8, 2017 presidential election. The party has also backed the three-month suspension of the chief executive officer of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission IEBC, Mr Ezra Chiloba. “The resignation of three commissioners ostensibly to protest the commencement of disciplinary action against the CEO confirms our long held fears that the rot at the IEBC goes to the very core of the organisation,” Mr Sifuna statement reads, referring to Monday’s exit of election commissioners Ms Consolata Maina, Dr Paul Kurgat, and Ms Margaret Mwachanya. The ODM official accused the three commissioners who resigned on Monday of having allowed Mr Chiloba the freedom to conduct Secretariat affairs without proper checks. "Why would the three commissioners not allow for the investigations to be completed prior to resigning? What do they know? What are they running from?” asked Mr Sifuna. Mr Sifuna named Mr Chiloba, his two deputies Mr Marjan Hussein Marjan and Ms Betty Nyabuto, as well as ICT head James Muhati and head of operations Ms Immaculate Kassait as some of the Secretariat staff who should be sacked.   Electoral commission officials say they are busy supervising by-elections in Nyeri and Kwale.
