Kenya Power's prepaid customers have in the last few days been experiencing delays of up to 15 hours to receive electricity tokens. The power firm has since acknowledged and apologised for the delay after angry customers started venting their frustrations on social media. Most of the complaints came from consumers who use virtual wallets like M-Pesa to buy their tokens, a 20-digit number which then is fed into the meter for instant electricity credits. The company has several numbers that one can use to purchase the tokens, but all have been experiencing delays. In the past, electricity consumers consistently complained about their power bills, an issue that led the power company to adopt the prepaid digital system.
