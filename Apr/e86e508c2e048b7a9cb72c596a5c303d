The rising demand for cheaper energy to power industries and the need to minimise environmental pollution pose a major challenge for the country. On the one hand, the country has the option of sticking to and even expanding its renewable energy resources such as hydro and geothermal power to remain part of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and reverse the effects of climate change. On the other hand, the country needs to generate more power for its expanding manufacturing sector to enable it transition into a middle-income economy. YAWNING GAP The installed power capacity of 2,333 megawatts, against a supply of 1,600 megawatts, from hydro, geothermal and diesel powered sources, leaves a yawning gap. To meet the shortfall, the government has been seeking to build a coal plant in Lamu County to generate 1,050 megawatts. It is also toying with the idea of setting up nuclear plant to inject another 1,000 megawatts into the national grid by 2027. POLLUTION Ironically, these energy sources the country is eyeing, are being shunned by countries that have been using them to power their huge manufacturing industries. Instead, these advanced nations are slowly shifting to more environmentally friendly energy sources to reduce air pollution, which is blamed for over 6.5 million deaths globally in 2015 alone.
