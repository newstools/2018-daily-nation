Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Francis Atwoli has asked the government to protect Oserian flower farm workers from exploitation and loss of jobs. The Cotu boss warned of a strike of all flower company workers in the country to protest “bad labour practices” at the Naivasha firm. Mr Atwoli said the country’s largest flower company has been exploiting workers and undermining their welfare. According to Mr Atwoli, the company has been arbitrarily dismissing its employees and turning their permanent jobs into casual ones. DISMISSALSHe urged Labour Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani to shield employees from practices “that have seen Oserian Development Company lay off about 2,500 workers”. “Thousands of workers are losing jobs every day due to illegal practices by employers. I appeal to the government to protect them,” Mr Atwoli said in Nakuru Town on Friday. “The government should not allow indirect slavery.” However, Oserian communications officer Catherine Riungu denied the claims of mass dismissals. She said the contracts for the 2,500 workers expired on March 30, adding that the company would not renew the agreements because of an internal reorganisation.
