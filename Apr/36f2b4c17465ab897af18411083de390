A Kisumu High Court on Monday granted Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o’s family a second chance to settle an inheritance row out of court, following an understanding between the warring parties. Prof Nyong’o’s nephews, Mr Geoffrey Omondi Nyong’o and Kenneth Odhiambo Okuthe, have sued the Governor and his sister, Dr Risper Nyagoy Nyong’o, for leaving out some of their siblings’ children from the list of beneficiaries of estate of their father, Hesbon Shimei Nyong’o. Mr Omondi, for instance, is the eldest son of the late Judith Nyong’o (the governor’s sister) and has a sibling, Fiona Atieno Nyong’o. He says they were cared for by  their grandfather but have not benefited from his estate since he died on November 10,2006. High Court judge Lady Justice Tripsisa Cherere gave the family time to settle the matter, failing  which a full hearing  will continue in July. She had ordered the same a few months ago but the family failed to agree after the governor travelled abroad for treatment. The judge directed that the governor and his sister commit, in writing, that they want to settle the matter out of court. Meanwhile, the petitioners’ lawyer, Rogers Mugumya, insisted that the governor and his sister be given 14 days to put down their consent in writing. “We need them to put it in writing so that we know they are committed to settling the matter out of court,” said Mr Mugumya. During an earlier hearing, Justice Cherere asked why the governor had taken the matter to  court when it could  have been settled at the family level. “The children are now adults they should have been given what is duly theirs,” Justice Cherere said.
