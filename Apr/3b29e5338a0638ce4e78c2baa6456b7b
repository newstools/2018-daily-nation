IN GOLD COAST, AUSTRALIA Kenya’s campaign at the 21st Commonwealth Games got off to a stuttering start on Thursday with none of the country’s competitors pushing for medal space here. Kenya was in action in six disciplines, namely boxing, lawn bowls, squash, triathlon, weightlifting and swimming with none of the eight athletes progressing. It was a sad start to the boxing programme when lightweight (60kg) Nick Okoth was ruled out on medical grounds after a clash of heads with his Trinidadian opponent Michael Alexander left him the worse for wear, the ringside doctor ruling him unfit to continue. Alexander, though, was given a clean bill of health to advance into the round of 16, much to the chagrin of Kenya’s deflated corner. LOST TO ANDERSON In bowling, Eunice Mbugua won her opening match at Broadbeach Bowls Club against Papua New Guinea’s Catherine Wimp 21-15 but was floored by Norfolk Island’s Carmen Anderson 21-7 pushing her to third place in the women’s “Section C” with three points behind Anderson and Canada’s Kelly McKerihen who are on six points each. She comes up against Botswana’s Nelly Senna in round three at 2am (Kenyan time) Friday before playing McKerihen at 5am and Cook Island’s Nooroa Mataio on Saturday to complete her Section C matches and know whether she advances to the quarter-finals later Saturday. In squash, Kenya’s pair of Hardeep Reel and Khaaliqa Nimji were both eliminated from the men’s round of 64 and women’s round of 32, respectively. Reel started well, winning the first two games against Othniel Bailey of St Vincent and the Grenadines 14-12 and 11-4 before he was sent reeling in the next three which he lost 4-11, 6-11, 11-13. Khaaliqa lost to Nikki Todd (Canada) in straight games, 3-0 (11-4, 11-8, 11-7). DUFFY WINS GOLD Earlier in the day, Bermuda’s Flora Duffy won gold in the triathlon at Southport Broadwater Parklands, completing the swimming, cycling and running legs in 56 minutes and 50 seconds, 43 seconds ahead of silver medallist Jessica Learmoth of England (57:33) with bronze medallist Joanna Brown of Canada a further 48 seconds back at 57:38 Kenya’s Hanifa Said completed the competition in 23rd place out of 24 competitors, her time of 1:15:18 some 18 minutes and 28 seconds behind the winner. Malaysia’s Chen Ying Yang (1:16:13) brought the rear, finishing 55 seconds behind Said.
