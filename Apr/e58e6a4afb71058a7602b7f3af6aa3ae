Sigona Golf Club’s Adam Tayebjee on Tuesday completed a three-round total of 227 gross to claim the Windsor Junior Strokeplay Championship at par-72 Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club course. The handicap five Tayebjee, who had carded 78 and 76 in the first two rounds on Monday, fired one over par 73 in yesterday’s final round to beat Muthaiga’s Zubair Khan by two shots. He started with birdies on the third and fifth, dropped a shot at the seventh but picked up birdies at the 10th and 12th after bogeying the 11th. However a seven a the 16th and a single bogey at the 17th denied him an under par score. Khan started well, firing level par 72 in the first round and 75 in the second round. But he dropped several shots in the last round for 82 for a total of 229 to claim the 16-18 A division title, with another Muthaiga player Mutahi Kibugu firing 230 to finish second.
