After farmers have worked so hard to deliver harvests, it’s grossly unfair to block them from enjoying the full benefit of their sweat. However, this is the situation that now obtains in the grain basket region of the Rift Valley, and merely blaming the bureaucratic hiccups of National Cereals and Produce Board and other loopholes is not the solution. Several weeks ago, farmers were being turned away from the board’s depots with their produce. The explanation then was that there was suddenly more produce than had been anticipated, exceeding the money allocated. In effect, farmers were being accused of being too efficient and sent back home with their surplus harvest. CHEAP IMPORTS To add insult to injury, the market has been flooded with cheap imports. While there is nothing wrong with buying from our neighbours if there is a shortfall in production, that should never happen at the expense of our farmers. Millers are also losing out as consumers snub sifted maizemeal and snap up the excess supply in the market for grinding in posho mills. FOOD SECURITY Farming is a delicate enterprise where huge losses can easily occur; hence the need to protect the farmers’ investment in inputs, labour and other expenses. Millers are also not in it for charity. The onus is on the Agriculture ministry, whose key docket is to ensure food security, to intervene and sort out the mess.
