Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga on Thursday held talks with retired President Daniel Moi in Kabarak, Nakuru County. The two leaders discussed state of the Kenyan nation in a meeting that lasted for more than an hour. The meeting comes a little over a month after the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and the opposition leader at Harambee House, where they pledged to work together. Mr Odinga's Spokesman Dennis Onyango said the opposition leader visited the retired president to wish him well following his recent hospitalisation in Israel. A statement released by Mr Onyango showed that Mr Odinga was accompanied by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Shariff and Vihiga Senator George Khaniri. Mr Onyango said the ODM leader was received by Tiaty MP William Kamket and Moiben MP Silas Tiren when he landed at the Kabarak airstrip. At the Kabarak home, it was the Baringo Senator Gideon and former MP Nick Salat who ushered him into the meeting with the former president.
