Activist Okiya Omtatah has moved to the High Court to challenge the controversial Kiambu County’s Alcoholic Drinks Control Act set to come into effect this Sunday. The petitioner wants the law declared unconstitutional, arguing that county governments “have very limited role” on liquor licensing and control. Mr Omtatah said regulation of alcoholic drinks is the mandate of the national government through the Kenya Bureau of Standards, National Authority for Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Kenya Revenue Authority and the Anti-Counterfeit Agency. He said the county government should restrict itself to issuing bar licences. BAR OWNERS Governor Ferdinand Waititu approved the bill last month as a way of abating alcoholism and the sale of unlicensed alcohol. However, there was backlash from bar owners when Governor Waititu instructed them to apply for fresh permits.

The section stipulates that permits of bar operators will be automatically cancelled if they fail to comply with the Act within 30 days.
