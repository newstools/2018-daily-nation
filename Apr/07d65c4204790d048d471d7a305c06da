The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission should, indeed, be seriously concerned that many people hardly believe the statistics it has been brandishing as proof of its success in fighting graft. Since its inception, its chief executive says, the EACC has prosecuted more than 7,000 cases, some involving senior politicians. But even if it has, handling less than 10,000 cases in several years in a country where corruption is endemic, is nothing to write home about. Worse, there are no big names of any convicts serving long sentences, whose name recognition would send a chill up the spines of would-be offenders. The Auditor-General’s reports are replete with names and evidence of mindless looting of public coffers. They should be a basis to pursue the looters and have them convicted. DEVELOPMENTThe mere fact that the EACC deems it fit to defend itself against public criticism is telling. For an agency so well-funded and staffed, and the personnel richly facilitated, its impact in the war against graft is woeful. Many Kenyans are cynical as they would have expected heads to roll, confirming that the agency is up to the task. Corruption diverts resources from public programmes into the pockets of a few for their own selfish interests. It’s this distortion that this public-funded agency must relentlessly fight. It has to make it too hot for the corrupt in the public and private sectors to thrive.
