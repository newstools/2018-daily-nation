Contributing significantly to the heavy burden of provision of healthcare are minor diseases and emerging illnesses that do not often get adequate attention. They include haemophilia, a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body’s ability to make blood clots, which is needed to stop bleeding. Tuesday was World Haemophilia Day. According to official statistics, one in every 10,000 Kenyans has haemophilia — that is some 5,000 out of the population of more then 48 million Kenyans. The number may seem small, even negligible, when juxtaposed with the figures for the major diseases. BLEEDING However, the danger of haemophilia becomes stark when viewed in the right context. When blood cannot clot properly, excessive bleeding — external and internal — occurs after an injury or even medical procedures. The situation becomes life-threatening when it is discovered too late in surgery or after an injury that a patient is haemophilic. The stakes are even higher when vital body organs such as the brain are involved. Last week, a young nurse in Siaya County died from excessive bleeding after a Caesarean section — an outcome later attributed to the condition. It is imperative that Kenyans get as much information as possible about this illness so that those afflicted can get the necessary support.
