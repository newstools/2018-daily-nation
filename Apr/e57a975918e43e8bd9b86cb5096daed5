MPs have received a petition seeking the removal of Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i from office.The petitioner, Mohamud Sheikh, who identified himself as a Wajir resident and a businessman accused Matiang’i of violating the Constitution and ignoring court orders, therefore unsuitable to hold a public office. Dr Matiang’i last week failed to appear before the High Court to explain circumstances behind the re-deportation of lawyer Miguna Miguna despite the court finding him guilty of contempt and fining them Sh200,000. On Tuesday, the CS, alongside his principal secretaries and the Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet, were questioned by the National Assembly’s Committee on Security over Dr Miguna’s saga. He said he had not been served any High Court orders and denied Dr Miguna was re-deported. The lawyer, he told MPs, was simply “removed from the airside at JKIA, not deported as he was not in Kenya”. Dr Matiang'i said he was not served any of the three High Court and claimed some judges, activist lawyers and civil societies were out to embarrass and intimidate government by through ex-parte orders. Although he did not name any judge, lawyer or activist, the CS was categorical that courts were being misused to humiliate the executive.   Interior CS maintains fiery lawyer is a foreigner.
