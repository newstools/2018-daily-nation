A 25-year old woman from Kigumo Constituency, Murang’a County, has been charged with being in possession of Sh2.8 million in fake Kenyan currency. The suspect, Ms Esther Mwikali, was arrested on April 1 after the police received a tip-off from members of the public who had fallen prey to fake notes in the area. Appearing in a Muranga court, before Senior Resident Magistrate Agnes Mwangi, the suspect denied the charges and was released on a Sh300,000 bond. FAKE MONEY The arrest came after Kenol residents and traders complained of an increase in fake Kenyan currency in the area. Mr Antony Mwangi, a trader, said cases of counterfeit notes had increased in Kenol town.
