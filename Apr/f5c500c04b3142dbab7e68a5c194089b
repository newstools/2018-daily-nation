New Zealanders Ian Snook and Murray Roulston are due in Kenya this week to take charge at Kenya Simbas' camp ahead of the Rugby Africa Gold Cup and the 2019 World Cup qualifiers in June. It goes without saying that their work has been cut out for them since they will be required to settle down fast with the matches to start in two months. Snook, who is the head coach, brings with him a wealth of experience, having coached professionally for the past 33 years in New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, England, Ireland, Japan, Croatia, and Italy. But the duo will need full support from Kenya Rugby Union and all other stakeholders in the industry if Kenya Simbas are to reclaim the Gold Cup as well as qualify for the 2019 World Cup in Japan. Snookâ€™s predecessor, Jerome Paarwater, almost guided the Simbas to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where they failed to advance as Namibia got the nod alongside automatic qualifiers South Africa. Unlike in 2015, when Kenya participated in the Vodacom Cup in South Africa besides other build-up Test matches, this time, there are none. While the team has been in camp for some time, it is important that everything is put in place to ensure the players and members of the technical team are comfortable and well-remunerated.
