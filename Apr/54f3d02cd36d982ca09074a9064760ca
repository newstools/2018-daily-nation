Police in Kahuro, Muranga County, are investigating the circumstances surrounding the defilement and murder of a 12-year-old girl after it emerged that two more people could have been involved in her killing. Kahuro OCPD David Kandie said they had contemplated closing the file after both the accused and the victim died. However, the police have launched probe to establish the role of two unnamed accomplices in the rape and murder of the minor. The Class Five pupil was allegedly defiled and strangled by Duncan Wakahiu, 17. The suspect, Duncan Wakahiu, was later killed before his body was set ablaze after the girl’s body was found in his room. DRUGS The suspect’s mother Lucy Wangari said that before her son died, he had named two people, whom he said, gave him drugs and aided in committing the heinous act. This has prompted the police to probe the matter further. “Before my son died, he named two people whom he accused of giving him drugs and taking part in defiling and killing of the girl,” Ms Wangari said. Mr Kandie said a team of officers had been dispatched to the Kahuro village to get more details and arrest the culprits. DRUG ABUSE “My team is on the ground to establish the truth of the matter, we shall bring to book all those who took part in the killing of the teenager and the girl and charge them in court,” the OCPD told journalists at his office in Kahuro police station. Mr Kandie said drug abuse in the Muranga County was rife. He noted that bhang, being the most abused drug, could be the cause of increased cases of crime in the county. “After we eradicated consumption of illicit liquor in the county, people have now resorted to smoking bhang,” he said. He, however, blamed the courts for frustrating their efforts. “My officers are trying hard to arrest the culprits (bhang smokers) but sometimes, our efforts are frustrated by the courts when the suspects are set free,” he said.
