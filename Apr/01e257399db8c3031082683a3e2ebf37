At least five people among them a retired District Commissioner have been hospitalised after being hacked with machetes as they assessed their land in the recently demarcated Mwea settlement scheme in Embu County. Mr Ireri Ndong’ong’i was among the beneficiaries who received title deeds for the 44,000-acre land situated in Makima Ward, Mbeere South sub-County. However, as he reached Mwanjo village about two kilometres from Makima market, he was attacked by a group of people armed with machetes and clubs, leaving him unconscious. Mr Ndong’ong’i suffered deep cuts on his head, chest and abdomen and was rescued by a group of journalists who had gone to assess the situation after beneficiaries were allowed to visit the vast land. Mr Cosmas Ndeti, an eye witness who saw some of the victims being ferried to the health centre, narrated with shock after seeing one of the victims of the brutal attack. “His hand had been chopped off and he was in great pain,” Mr Cosmas Ndeti, an eye witness said. He was rushed to the nearby Makima Health Centre where, with several other victims received first aid before they were transferred to the Embu Level V Hospital for treatment. A contingent of anti-riot security officers led by Mbeere South Deputy County Commissioner Beverly Opwora and the area OCPD Ahmed Mohamed were at hand at Makima DO’s office coordinating security and rescuing of the injured.   The allocation process was flawed, says Mbeere South MP Mutava Musyimi.
