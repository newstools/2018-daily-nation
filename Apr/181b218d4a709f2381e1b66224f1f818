A high-profile World Boxing Council (WBC) ring officials’ seminar ended yesterday in Nairobi attended by 100 participants from across Africa. The seminar, which was the first of its kind in Africa, will go a long way to improving the standards of officiating on the continent, which is a key ingredient in boxing development. However, it also exposed the poor leadership at Kenya Professional Boxing Commission (KPBC), which has no secretariat or proper office. The seminar comes at a time when boxing standards in the country have plummeted. POOR LEADERSHIP The famous national boxing team, fondly known as the “Hit Squad”, is now a laughing stock. It failed to get a medal at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games for the first time since the 2002 Manchester games. It is only female boxer Christine Ongare who saved the day with a bronze. Poor leadership and wrangles at Boxing Association of Kenya is one reason for the deteriorating standards. FUTURE This has led to low standards of officiating in the local game. Professional boxing relies on a firm foundation set at amateur level. However, the amateurs will have nothing to look forward to if KPBC has no development agenda for the sport. It’s time KPBC puts its house in order.
