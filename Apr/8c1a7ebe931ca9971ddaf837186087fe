One passenger has sustained a slight injury as 38 others escaped unhurt after a bus they were travelling in from Mombasa heading to Tanzania caught fire on the Likoni-Lunga Lunga highway at Mrima, in Lunga Lunga constituency. The public service vehicle was reduced to a shell after efforts to contain the fire failed during the 8:30 am incident. "There were 39 passengers and all are safe except a woman who slightly twisted her leg as she tried to escape through the window," he said.   Lunga Lunga Deputy County Commissioner, Mr Josphat Biwott, said they have started investigations to establish the cause of the fire.
