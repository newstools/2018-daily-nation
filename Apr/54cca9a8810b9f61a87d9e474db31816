Equity Bank has joined the list of lenders appointed by the government to disburse cash to elderly citizens under the social welfare programme dubbed Inua Jamii. Poor citizens aged 70 years and above receive Sh4,000 every two months in a social safety net that is currently estimated to cover 500,000 beneficiaries across the country. Equity, which now joins KCB and Cooperative Bank, said it has kicked off the process to sign up the selected senior citizens. “We will offer multiple solutions in a single card that will benefit the senior citizens enrolled in the programme,” said Equity Bank’s special projects director, Allan Waititu. “With the cards, beneficiaries of Inua Jamii 70 and above programme will be able to access their cash allocations and use the card to purchase goods and access services.” READ: 566,000 seek State stipend for the elderly The beneficiaries will get an account and smart card, which uses biometric authentication, to access funds issued through the selected three banks branch networks and identified agents across the country.
