Six people, among them three children have died in a road crash near Mariakani Town along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. Kaloleni OCPD Kennedy Osando said the crash happened when the driver a truck that was heading to Mombasa tried to overtake at a steep section of the road only to hit the matatu which was heading to Voi from Mombasa. “It happened at the junction of Kinango and the SGR terminal in Mariakani and involved a matatu which was ferrying passengers to Voi," said Mr Osando. He said the matatu driver tried to colliding with the lorry but his vehicle was hit on the right rear side. “Because of that impact, three passengers died on the spot, two children and a woman. The other injured passengers were rushed to Mariakani Sub-County Hospital but another woman and a child succumbed to their injuries,” said Mr Osando. He said that those in a critical condition were transferred to the Coast General Hospital where another woman succumbed to her injuries on the way to the hospital. “In total, we have six fatalities, three women and three children aged between two and six years. All the bodies have been taken to Coast General Hospital," said Mr Osando. The two vehicles were towed to Mariakani Police Station. The OCPD asked drivers to be careful on the road especially during this rainy season, saying the incident could have been avoided had the lorry driver not been careless on the road. “People should avoid this careless overtaking. The accident happened while it was raining and that requires drivers to be extra-careful,” said Mr Osando. He said that police will increase surveillance along the highway to tame rogue drivers flouting traffic rules. Kilifi County Commissioner Magu Mutindika condoled with the families of those who lost their lives and warned drivers against reckless driving. “It is sad that the lives of the people have been lost in such tragic way. I want to ask drivers to exercise due care while on the road,” he said.
