Nyeri County Assembly Speaker John Kaguchia has invited the public to give submissions on the suitability of Ms Caroline Wanjiru Karugu, the nominee for deputy governor position. Mr Kaguchia said Ms Karugu's nomination was timely. “We will vet her next week,” he said.The position fell vacant when Mr Mutahi Kahiga was sworn in as Nyeri governor following the death of Wahome Gakuru in a road accident in November. Her name was sent to the House on Thursday and forwarded to the Committee on Appointments, which is chaired by the Speaker. SOCIAL MEDIA Ms Karugu will face the committee and questioned on her experience, personal life and suitability for the county's second highest position “Tarnishing her name on social media will not work. Nyeri residents are invited to make their submissions before Friday,” Mr Kaguchia said. If the rosy relationship between Mr Kahiga and the assembly is anything to go by, it unlikely that the ward representatives will reject Ms Karugu. Her nomination has been received well by local leaders. BROKERS Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua praised the county boss "for refusing to yield to political pressure to pick particular individuals". “I applaud our governor for not giving in to unsolicited advice and underhand dealings by political brokers and self-seekers,” he said. “The governor needed a free hand to appoint a deputy because it is an extension of his office and requires a person with the chemistry and sync to deliver on his pledges.” Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu said nominating Ms Karugu "who hails from here is a great relief to constituents who are still grieving the loss of Dr Gakuru". “We take this as a show of respect,” he said.   The bill will now be taken to the National Assembly for concurrence before the president signs it into law.
