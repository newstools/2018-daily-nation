Two people died on Friday evening in a mining quarry in Homa Bay County following heavy rains. The dead include a Form two student at Omindi Secondary School located in the county. The 17-year-old student and Peter Ochieng, 24, were buried under the quarry when the soil structure beneath the quarry caved in. The two were mining construction stones next to Oriwo Primary School at Oywer Village, Kodero Sub-Location in Rachuonyo North Sub County. Local Assistant Chief Israel Amadi said the the two went into the quarry to look for some money by mining stones, a main source of livelihood for residents in Karachuonyo region. "We got reports that the two were buried deep inside the mines following the caving in of the mines," said Mr Amadi, adding that "attempts by other miners and villagers to immediately locate where the two had been buried in the quarry became fruitless following lack of excavation equipment." The bodies of the two were retrieved following a long dig-out and were taken to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital Mortuary. "The Form Two student was an orphan on school holiday and had gone to look for money to pay school fees and for his siblings' upkeep," he added. Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum confirmed the incident, urging the miners to keep away from the mines during the rainy seasons.   Property worth millions of shillings destroyed in the last 72 hours.
