The Great Rift Valley Golf Resort’s Simon Njogu, picked up a triple bogey at the 23th hole, but still went on to finish with one under par in the final round and win the 2018 Winson Churchill Cup at the par-72 Thika Sports Club course on Sunday. The off-scratch Njogu, who carded one over par 73 in the first round, made three birdies in the first nine of the final round, to start the back nine with three under par. He however dropped a shot at the par three-11th, before pushing his driver to the right of the fairway at the 13th, chipped his approach shot to the bunker, came out not well enough, to drop three shots, though he made two more birdies at the 14th and 17th for his 71 which gave him a total of level par 144 gross. Njogu beat Vet Lab’s Isiah Otuke by four shots. Otuke carded 73 and 75 for 1488 as his club-mate Isaac Makhoha, the only deaf golfer in Kenya, tied for third place Limuru’s John Karichu and Dennis Saikwa of Royal. Karichu beat the others on countback to finish third having shot one over in the second round. Makhoha on the other hand, claimed the overall nett title on 141 nett, five shots better than Thika’s Paul Nduati and Duncan Ndungu on 146 and 147 nett respectively. Saikwa won the first round gross on 73 and the second round went to Chruchill Cup defending champion Mike Kisia of Vet Lab. The two nett winners were Sigona’s Adam Tayebjee on 70 nett and Thika’s Brian Omondi with 71.
