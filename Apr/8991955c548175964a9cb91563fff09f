The raging violence in Mt Elgon that has seen nearly 40 people killed and property destroyed in recent weeks is a blatant mockery of the security system. The gangs behind the mayhem have defied orders from not only Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, who declared a curfew, but also Deputy President William Ruto. The DP toured the sub-county several weeks ago and put the criminals on notice but the crime wave persists. Dr Matiang’i has also been to the area to reinforce efforts to restore peace but raids on homes and attacks on innocent people continue. CHIEFS The law-abiding citizens deserve better, considering that this is a resurgence of the lawlessness that claimed many more lives several years ago. Whatever grievances these people might have, they are expressing them in the wrong way. But the latest development, where the goons now target chiefs, is proof that the situation is getting out of hand. The criminals realise that chiefs play a crucial role at the grassroots. The chiefs are in a position to get good intelligence on the activities of such gangs, and are also the natural allies of the security personnel in fighting crime. It is time, therefore, to protect and enable these local administrators to discharge their duties without any fear. The gangs terrorising Mt Elgon must be relentlessly pursued and neutralised.
