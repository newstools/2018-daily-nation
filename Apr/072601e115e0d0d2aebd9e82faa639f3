The Anti-Corruption Court has on Wednesday allowed the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to probe afresh former Transport Cabinet Secretary Michael Kamau over alleged abuse of office and flouting of tender rules. Justice Hedwig Ongudi declined to allow his application to be acquitted, ruling his appeal before the Appellate Court was allowed on a technical ground that EACC was not properly constituted at the time it completed the investigations and forwarded its report and recommendations to the Director of Public Prosecutions. “It was not based on the manner the investigations were carried out or the innocence of Mr Kamau. That is why the Court of Appeal did not get into the substance of the investigations undertaken by the EACC,” ruled Justice Ongudi. Mr Kamau’s name first appeared in President Uhuru Kenyatta's list of shame that was presented to Parliament on March 26, 2015. More to follow...   The withdrawal of 125 graft cases last week has come as an anti-climax.
