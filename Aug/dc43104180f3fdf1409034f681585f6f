Although Branton is not my son, a fact that is clear to everyone with a keen eye, once his mother Catherina supported by my parents claimed that I was the father, I decided, for the sake of humanity, to be a statesman and accept him as my son. You see, a few months ago, even President Kenyatta and Raila Odinga swallowed their pride and agreed to unite so that we can have peace. They were doing exactly what I had done a few years ago. After birth, Branton went to live with his mother. But my parents kept nagging me, saying they were not happy that ‘their blood’ was staying far away from them. “Kama angekuwa msichana singekuwa na shida,” said my mother. “Lakini kijana lazima akue tukimuona.” But at the time, I realised my parents were not seeking the return of Branton. Somehow, they had become very close to Catherina, and they were using Branton to make me marry his mother, especially since she had climbed the professional ladder. She was a deputy at a time I was still a mere teacher. So close were they that Catherina would visit them frequently and buy them household goods. I would have considered her had she behaved whenever she visited, but look, she never gave me time with her alone, and for some reason that is not obvious to me, she refused to sleep in my isimba, preferring to spend at my parents’ house. As if I bite people! When I met Fiolina and decided to settle down with her, my parents just went through the motions of dowry negotiations and wedding reluctantly, and to date, sources close to them indicate that they believe Fiolina is just a passing cloud, who will soon go and be replaced with Catherina. After taking some cows at Catherina’s place about four years ago, Branton came to live with us. Initially, he stayed with my parents as Fiolina could not accept him for disciplinary reasons. By now you know that unlike the alleged father, Branton is not very disciplined, he is a rude boy. As such, both my parents and Fiolina rejected him, and that is how he ended staying with my sister Yunia. TWO THINGS HAPPENED But two things happened in the last few months. First, this arrangement had became Yunia’s cash cow. She took advantage and would fleece money from Catherina and I. Branton was always in need of money for fees clothing, medical care among other things. And whenever I failed to send the cash, I would hear from everyone how I was unable to take care of just one child yet I was a deputy head earning a lot of money. “Hawezi chunga mtoto mmoja nyumbani, sembuse watoto wengi shuleni?” Yunia would ask the parents of Mwisho wa Lami Primary School pupils. The second thing was that baby Sospeter, whom everyone still calls Probox, arrived. Despite Fiolina not liking Branton, she found him useful as he could run errands. And since she would give Branton coins to buy kaa ngumu and sugarcane, he liked it. That’s how Branton found himself back in our house last April. Soon, Fiolina and Branton developed a strong bond to the extent that I felt like an outsider in my house. But Branton’s return caused major cashflow issues to Yunia. And it wasn’t long before we started hearing things. “Branton anateswa sana na mama wa kambo,” Yunia told everyone who cared to listen. “He is overworked, underfed and no one even buys him new clothes.” She even claimed that the boy had started performing poorly academically, yet while staying with Yunia, Branton rarely went to school. Unable to get Branton back, and having severed relations with Fiolina, Yunia be-friended Catherina, who is now a headmistress. So when Catherine started sending me SMSs asking how Branton was doing, I did not need a calculator to know there was more than met the eye. I really got upset when Catherine claimed that we had turned Branton to our maid. “I am not happy to hear that Branton is Fionila’s slave working from 4am to 9pm,” she wrote. “If this continues I will come and take him.” OVER THE MOON “Who told you?” I asked her. She did not respond. About a month ago, Catherina visited my parents. As usual, she had shopped for them. She also bought Branton new clothes, toys and chips. Branton was over the moon. He stayed with his mother at my parent’s place the whole day, to Fiolina’s chagrin. Catherina would a week later,send more clothes for Branton, something that I did not like. When schools closed, she asked me if I could allow Branton to visit her, but I declined. Last Wednesday while enjoying my drink at Hitlers, I received several please call me messages from Fiolina. Since I had no airtime, I did not call back. After all, wasn’t I going to be with her later on? So I continued partaking whatever I was partaking. A few minutes later, Nyayo arrived. “Dre uko hapa na kwako kumewaka moto,” he said as he gulped down a drink. I asked him what was the problem and he only said. “Kaa twende,” beckoning me to his motorcycle. We arrived at my home to find Catherina there. She was quarrelling with Fiolina as they haggled over Branton. “Branton ni mtoto wangu, sio mfanyikazi wako,” said Catherina. “Kama mtoto ni wako, umekuwa wapi miaka hii yote, mtoto akitoka kwako alikuwa amekonda, ona vile amenona siku hizii,” Fiolina responded. Catherine could not take this lying done. “What do you mean? “Hata nguo amevaa ni mimi nilinunua.” Branton stood there, confused. On one hand he loved his mother who bought him gifts and new clothes. But on the other, he had a special bond with Fiolina who ensured he had constant supply of sugarcane and kaa ngumu. “Kama ni bwana unataka sema dunia yote ijue naweza kukuwachia huyo mlevi,” said Fiolina, “Sio kupitia kwa mtoto.” “Huyo fala niliwachana nayeye kitambo wewe tosheka na yeye,” answered Catherina It happened so fast, Fiolina dashed to Catherina and wrestled her to the ground. They started fighting. I didn’t know what to do, the two women having said bad things about me. Luckily, Nyayo separated them. I have no idea where Yunia came from, but she took Branton away, saying that the two women could hurt the boy as they were violent. “Hao sio wamama” she said. “Na baba mgani huyu hawezi tetea Branton akipiganiwa?” And just like that, Yunia had Branton again, another opportunity for her to make money from Fiolina, Catherina and me. But it won’t last long. Trust me, Branton will be back with us by the times schools open!          From school, Saphire went straight to Hitler’s; we found him lying by the road, drunk.
