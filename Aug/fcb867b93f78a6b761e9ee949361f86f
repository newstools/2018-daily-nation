The family of a Kenyan trader whom they say was mysteriously killed in Tanzania is crying out for justice. Mr Franklin Mboya died in Dar es Salaam after he was allegedly stabbed with a kitchen knife twice in the chest. His Kenyan passport and national identity card were also stolen. His father, Mr Tom Rachuonyo, who is a Migori-based journalist working with the People Daily newspaper, said the family of his son's wife claimed that he committed suicide. HURRIED BURIAL “But the nature of his death shows he was killed and did not commit suicide. Some people then hurriedly organised for burial [but] I was alerted and stopped it," he told journalists in Migori Town. “My son will get justice no matter how long it takes," said Mr Rachuonyo. The body was apparently “hidden” in a mortuary for three days before the father could be allowed to view it. “And the body was booked as that of a male Tanzanian," he explained. Mr Rachuonyo said they later buried the body in Dar after failing to raise money to bring it back home to Kenya.
