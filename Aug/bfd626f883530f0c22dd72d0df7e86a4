A 10-year old girl has been attacked and killed by a crocodile at Kiambere Dam. Mawia Mwendwa King'ola met her death as she drew water at the dam in Karura village, Embu County on Tuesday evening. The Class Two Karura Primary School pupil had been sent to draw water at around 6pm. Kiambere Ward Representative Lenny Masters Mwaniki, who contacted Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) officials after the 6pm Tuesday incident, said residents saw two crocodiles pull away the girlâ€™s body before they started pelting them with stones. "I have been informed that another crocodile has been spotted, the people are now desperate," Mr Mwaniki told the Nation on phone on Tuesday evening. The MCA said human-wildlife conflict had increased in the area since the residents, who do not have piped water, have to fetch the precious commodity from the crocodile infested dams. KWS officials said rescue operations could only be done during the day.
