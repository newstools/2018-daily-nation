A woman has been charged with conning jobseekers thousands of shillings, claiming she would secure them employment in Afghanistan. The victims had been promised jobs as security guards and cleaners. As Ednah Kendi Kiruki was pleading to nine charges of defrauding jobseekers, more than 20 people stood up in court and complained to chief magistrate Francis Andayi that they were also victims of the scam. The furious complainants insisted their plight be addressed by the court before the fate of Ms Kiruki is determined. The suspect had just denied fraudulently receiving Sh230,700 from nine claimants. Her defence lawyer applied for her release on bond, saying she was a young mother. Mr Andayi advised the new complainants to file a report with the police so that more charges can be filed against the accused. “This court acts on what has been presented before it by the State prosecutor,” Mr Andayi told them. Ms Kiruki asked the court to give her two weeks to refund all the monies. Mr Andayi, who released Ms Kiruki on a cash bail of Sh200,000, directed she be remanded at the Railway Police Station where she will meet all the complainants and draw an agreement on how she will reimburse the money. She will present the agreement between her and the complainants in court Thursday.
