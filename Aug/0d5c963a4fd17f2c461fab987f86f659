Kenyan international striker Michael Olunga scored his maiden goal in Kashiwa Reysolâ€™s 5-1 humiliation of Varen Nagasaki in a Japanese League match at Kashiwa stadium on Saturday. The former Gor Mahia striker replaced Yusuke Segawa in the 69th minute, before adding his name on the score sheet three minutes into added time. Musashi Suzuki shot Varen into the lead on 11 minutes, but Brazilian Cristiano da Silva grabbed a quick brace on 21 and 24 minutes, before Junya Ito and Kohei Tezuka joined the party with a goal each in the second half. Olunga, who made his debut as a second half substitute in a 2-0 defeat away to Jubilo Iwata on August 19, joined the side last month from Chinese side Guanzhou Zchicheng for a reported Sh300 million transfer fee and is poised to take home Sh15 million in monthly salary package. Reysol sit 11th on the 18-team log with 29 points after 24 matches. They next visit Yokohama in a league match next Saturday.
