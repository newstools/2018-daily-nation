Safaricom chief executive Bob Collymore appeared Monday morning before parliament's ICT committee, marking his first public event after a long absence. The National Assembly team is looking into telcos dominance in the Kenyan market that has seen top managers of telecommunications firms appear before legislators amid a push by competitors to have Safaricom declared dominant. Mr Collymore, who had stepped away from the firm's helm for 9 months to seek treatment for an undisclosed illness, thanked well wishers for their support "I'm back. Thanks to everyone who supported me over the past 9 months especially the clinical team at @UCLH, my superb @SafaricomPLC team and of course my wife Wambui Kamiru," he said today via his official Twitter handle today. The Safaricom boss informed investors in May that he would be returning from his extended medical leave as soon as doctors in London cleared him to travel. The firm had announced that its net profit for the year ended March 2018 hit Sh55.3bn from Sh48.4bn the previous year.
