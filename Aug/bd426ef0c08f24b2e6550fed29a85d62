Kenya’s media watchdog has threatened to take unspecified action against TV host Jeff Koinange and Citizen TV for alleged unethical conduct. Media Council of Kenya (MCK) has written to Royal Media Services Editorial Director Joe Ageyo and Mr Koinange over interview the news anchor held with Cotu secretary-general Francis Atwoli on Wednesday evening. In the complaint dated June 16, 2018, MCK CEO David Omwoyo says Mr Koinange breached media ethics and rules on privacy. Among the issues the council has taken issue with is Mr Koinange’s question to Mr Atwoli to clear the air about his marriage to a TV anchor Mary Kilobi. Even though Mr Atwoli admitted that he was married to Ms Kilobi, MCK notes that Mr Koinange proceeded to ask a number of private questions such as the age difference between the two. In particular, Mr Omwoyo takes issue with the questions: “Lakini kazi bado unafanya?”, “Katiba bado unasoma?” and “Kazi unaweza?” which were repeated a number of times in the first part of the interview. At one point, Mr Atwoli dismisses Mr Koinange, reminding him that it is important to be cautious about disclosing his private issues for the sake of his children. The council has faulted Mr Koinange for being persistent in discussing explicit adult content on TV outside the watershed hour. According to MCK, the host has contravened clause 10 on obscenity and taste reporting of the code of conduct for the practice of journalism in Kenya. The council also claims Mr Koinange breached clause 13 of the Code of Conduct of the practice of journalism on protection of privacy. The article states that inquiries into an individual’s private life is not acceptable and things concerning a person’s home, family, religion, sexuality, personal life and individual’s private affairs shall not be allowed. In his notice, Mr Omwoyo has also asked Citizen TV to urgently furnish the council with the steps that it has taken to avoid such an occurrence in the future.
