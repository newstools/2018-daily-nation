The pledge by Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki to regulate the cost of essential drugs is a timely intervention following the recent revelation of massive rip-off of patients by medical facilities. An Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission report a fortnight ago revealed a major scandal of drug procurement, stating how patients were being charged extremely high prices for drugs, sometimes more than four times the recommended price. Worse, the costs were exaggerated where patients paid through insurance, which simply means it is a racket involving many across the chain. What is upsetting is the fact that public health facilities obtain their medicines from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) at moderate costs but charge very expensively for them — making a killing, literally, from the sick and vulnerable. This is not acceptable and goes against all plans for universal health coverage. SUPPLY CHAIN It is imperative that the government intervenes to restore order and sanity in the drug supply chain. Ms Kariuki’s proposal for regulation of medicine cost fits pretty well with the plan to expand medical care to all. Essentially, access to universal health coverage is obstructed by the inordinately high costs and the converse is to lower the prices. That is only possible through regulation. But that can only work if the minister also puts in place stringent enforcement measures. We are alive to the shenanigans in the health sector, where individuals use all means possible to extract money from the vulnerable public. They will seek new crafty ways to short-circuit the system to get their way. Moreover, Kemsa has to be properly resourced so that it can stock of all the essential drugs to eliminate the possibility of public health facilities seeking procurement elsewhere, opening avenues for extortion. The government should also streamline the supply chain to ensure efficiency and sustainability of drug provisions.
