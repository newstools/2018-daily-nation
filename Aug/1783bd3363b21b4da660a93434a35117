The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (Adak) has raised concern over the lack of lawyers conversant with banned substance abuse laws in the country. Adak chief Japhter Rugut said the country has few lawyers specialised in Anti-Doping issues, which is frustrating their cause especially when instituting cases at the Sports Dispute Tribunal. Rugut however said the case is understandable since the area is an emerging issue and thus requires capacity building of the key stakeholders involved. Rugut said that they will now partner with the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) to provide professional training and capacity building to advocates with a view to enhance their capacity in handling Anti-Doping cases. Rugut was speaking when he made a presentation during the LSK Annual Conference in Kwale. “We currently have many matters in court at the Sports Disputes Tribunal we have instituted. What we have found out is that we have very few lawyers in this country who have specialised in Anti-Doping issues,” said Rugut. He further added that the agency will put in place mechanisms to ensure that lawyers participating in these sensitisation and training forums earn Continuous Professional Development (CPD) points through the LSK. LSK Chief Executive Officer Mercy Wambua welcomed the proposal by Adak saying that as a contemporary phenomenon, Anti-Doping is one of the areas that would benefit lawyers. “Our CPD Committee sits annually to review emerging areas which it then factors for our members professional training,” she said. “We look forward to working with Adak in this endeavour and urge our members to take up the opportunity and ground themselves in Anti-Doping,” she said. Rugut said Adak will soon submit a written proposal that will provide the framework on how it aspires to provide the technical grounding to advocates through its legal department.
