Kenya Sevens winger William "Lomu" Ambaka scored a brace of tries in his test debut as Kenya Simbas thrashed visiting Tunisia 67-0 in 2019 Rugby World Cup Africa qualifier on Saturday at the RFUEA grounds. Another debutant, Mohammed Omollo, also landed a try in Simbas ruthless mauling of the tourists at a packed RFUEA ground. Ambaka touched down a brace as Kenya Simbas scored 11 unanswered tries to earn a bonus point victory which saw the Kenyans consolidate their second place in the six-team standings with 17 points and keep their dream of qualifying for the 2019 Rugby World Cup due for Japan alive. The Simbas now only need to beat Namibia in their last match next Saturday to make it to the World Cup. Other Simbas try scorers were skipper Davis Chenge, Andrew Chogo, Jacob Ojee, Elkeans Musonye, Darwin Mukidza, Martin Owila, Peter Kaaria, Mohammed Omollo and Tony Onyango.         Kenya Simbas coach Ian Snook and skipper Davis Chenge believe the team can now dare dream of beating tough Namibia on Saturday and qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup due for Japan. Namibia top the championship that doubles up for Rugby Africa Gold Cup with 20 points from four bonus point victories. The winner of the match between the Simbas and Namibia on Saturday in Windhoek will qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The team that will finish second in the championship will have a second opportunity to qualify for Japan from the Repechage tournament featuring Canada, Germany and Hong Kong planned for November in France. "Yes, we can dare dream to reach the World Cup...I would love that to happen," said Snook after the match. "That is our main goal as we prepare to travel next week." Snook said even though his charges showed much improvement in defence, they still have a few weak areas they need to fix before travelling to Windhoek. Chenge said the players know they will be under pressure, but they are mentally prepared to handle the duel. Chenge added that Namibia is a highly physical side hence they will avoid going for direct play. "We are going for an open game with less contact as possible. That is just among other things we are planning for Namibia," said Chenge adding that the match will present a great opportunity for them to make history and change the face of Kenyan rugby. "It will be a big honour and we plan to execute to the best of our ability."
