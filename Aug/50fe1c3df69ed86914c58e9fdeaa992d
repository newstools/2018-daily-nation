President Uhuru Kenyatta has made an impromptu tour of Lamu County. The President, accompanied by Transport CS James Macharia, Chief of Defence Forces Samson Mwathethe and other top government officials, toured the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (Lapsset) Corridor project i Kililana where he held a closed-door meeting with the contractors. The President later inspected the 15-kilometre Mokowe Urban Road built by the the Kenya Urban Road Authority (Kura) and the 135-kilometre Lamu-Garsen road which is being constructed by H-Young company. The president met the officials of the companies in charge of the various projects and called on them to speed up the work. He said the Lamu-Garsen road is very crucial not only to the locals but also for the security of the region. PROJECTS President Kenyatta told contractors to ensure most of the projects are completed at least by August this year or before the end of next year. Mr Kenyatta also stressed the need for the Hindi to Lamu Port (Lapsset) road to be finished quickly. "You can't have a project of that magnitude like the Lapsset and you don't have good roads to access it. We need that road to be constructed fast for easy access to the port," said President Kenyatta. CS Macharia on his part promised to ensure speedy construction of the roads. Mr Kenyatta also met local leaders including area MCA Anab Haji who reiterated that the President's tour has opened a new chapter for the people of Lamu who are optimistic that the projects will be finished fast. "We are very happy for the President's tour. We believe his visit is a new dawn for us. We are now confident that there will be change in as far as government projects being done in our county are concerned. I think the delays that have been witnessed by some constructors will now end as from today," said Ms Anab.
