Hi Brenda, My girlfriend gets angry when I don’t give her money. What should I do?  It depends on how much money she's asking for, doesn't it? It definitely shouldn't be a habit. Everyone should be able to pay their own way, as an adult. Small amounts of money are ok, every once in a while – a dinner, a parking ticket, etc., but it shouldn't be an obligation, if you're ok with giving her money. Large sums of money from nowhere that disappear often with no explanation or benefit don't make sense. Where is the money going, and where is her job to support her needs? Are you a sponsor? *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda? Please email: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   He would like to meet my friends and I am embarrassed.
