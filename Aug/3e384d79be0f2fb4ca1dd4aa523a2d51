President Uhuru Kenyatta has come to the rescue of Gor Mahia after facilitating the team’s travel to Algeria for their continental assignment. Gor treasurer Sally Bolo on Friday confirmed that the head of state had bought air tickets for the team worth Sh6 million. She said the club’s management was stranded and wondering how to offset the Sh8 million expense to North Africa for the team’s last group match of the Caf Confederation Cup against USM Algers on Wednesday. “We wrote to the Ministry of Sports through Football Kenya Federation and they responded telling us they didn’t have the money,” said Bolo. “This morning, we received a call from State House who offered to buy the team air tickets. We are very grateful and excited because the President has also wished us well.” "Now our remaining task is to raise an extra Sh2 million to cover the team's expenses including accommodation and food for the period we will reside in Algeria." Thus, Gor are expected to depart for Algiers on Monday ahead of the clash in which Dylan Kerr's team have to pick atleast a point to be assured of qualifying for the quarter-finals. Rwanda’s Rayon Sport will play host to Tanzania’s Young Africans in Kigali in the other group match which has great significance to the Kenyan champions.   In their past 88 meetings, both sides have won 28 times, with 32 fixtures ending in a draw.
