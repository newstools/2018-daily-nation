The hunt for officers who irregularly approved structures built on riparian has claimed its first victim in the Nairobi City County. Governor Mike Sonko Tuesday suspended John Ojwang', a staff at the county's Urban Planning Department, for his role in the approval of buildings erected on riparian land. The suspension follows preliminary investigations ordered by Governor Sonko to hold to account county staff responsible for the irregular approvals. According to a statement sent to newsrooms by the governor's Director of Communications Elkana Jacob, it is alleged that Mr Ojwang' was responsible for granting permission for the construction of South End Mall along Lang’ata Road-Mbagathi Way junction, and Gem Suites in Riverside Estate. However, the county government noted that most of the illegal approvals were done in the 1980s and 1990s mainly by staff who have since retired or left City Hall. Mr Ojwang' was responsible for the authorisation of the two buildings mentioned above. "Nairobi City County Government has today suspended John Ojwang’, an employee in the Urban Planning Department for his role in the approval of buildings on riparian land," read the statement. The officer has since been issued with a 14-day notice to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him, including termination of his employment.   Sonko supervises recovery of public land in Gigiri on which a private car showroom had been built.
