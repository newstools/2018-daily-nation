A Parliamentary committee has backed a proposal to move the general elections from August to December, saying it would improve voter turnout. The National Assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs Committee on Thursday tabled its report supporting the change, arguing that it is convenient for most Kenyans. The committe's chairman, Baringo North MP William Cheptumo, told the House that 71 per cent of the people they spoke to during the 10-day public hearings in April supported the proposal. Proponents of the proposal noted that December elections would be less disruptive to schools' academic calendar, given that many public schools are uses as polling stations. In addition, the weather is pleasant, unlike August, which is rainy. “Students ordinarily sit the national examinations in the third term of an academic year, which normally comes after the August vacation. The public was of the view that the date of the general elections would be best scheduled in December as students have long finished their examinations,” reads the report. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has sponsored a bill seeking to have the date of the general elections moved from the second Tuesday of August every fifth year to the third Monday of December. Most MPS Thursday rejected the proposal during its second reading, saying it will necessitate a referendum.
