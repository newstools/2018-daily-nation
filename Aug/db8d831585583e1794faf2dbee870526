Detectives have smashed a suspected SIM fraud ring and arrested four suspects in Kiambu County . Crime busters from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) seized 30,000 SIM cards, 240 iPhones, 150 MI phones, two laptops, two inverters and other electrical appliances in the Wednesday operation. The suspects, whose names are yet to be released, are set to be arraigned on Thursday morning to face charges of illegal registration of SIM cards.   Detectives say the suspects had set up an illegal mobile communications centre in Kiambu County. DCI boss George Kinoti told Nation that one of the unearthed centres had been established at an undisclosed location in Ruiru.   Other reports indicated that a parallel mobile communications centre was also found in Eldoret. Cases of Kenyans losing money to SIM swap fraudsters have been on the rise in recent times.   On July 21, a Safaricom staff and university students suspected to be engaged in the fraud were arrested and charged in the ongoing crackdown.
