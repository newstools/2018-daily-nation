Two people died on Thursday night after their boat capsized in Lake Victoria as they fished in Nyatike sub-county, Migori. Vincent Ouma (37) and George Odhiambo (40) had been with two other fishermen when the accident occurred. Thirty-year-old Kennedy Odhiambo, one of the survivors, said the incident took place at about 9pm. "There were strong winds and high tides so we could not sail further. We swam to safety but our colleagues drowned," he said. Mr Phillip Opolo Orwa, the chief of Lower Central Kadem location where the four came from, said the boat capsized near Modi Ngwena beach. He said one of the bodies was retrieved from the lake and taken to Sori Lakeside Hospital mortuary in Karungu. A search for the second body was launched.   Boat owners have a habit of giving boats feminine names to attract good fortune.
