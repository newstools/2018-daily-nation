Self-christened travelling storyteller Rachman Blake, from New York, will be staging the show here in Nairobi as part of his ambitious quest to host 300 shows in 365 days. Professional storytellers are set to feature in the show as they share true dating stories about the time they got played, made, or just tangled up in love stuff. Did he look nothing like his pictures? Did she talk about her ex too much? Were you so nervous that you spilled your drink in your lap? According to the show’s description, you’ll hear the good, bad and the ugly of relatable dating stories as experienced by different people across the world. At Story Party you will be asked to put away your phones and enjoy a hilarious show that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer. The Story Party world tour "Online Dating Alternative” has been staged to sold out audiences in cities such as Budapest, Prague, Vienna, Amsterdam, Bucharest, Warsaw, Berlin, Helsinki and Istanbul. Tickets for Wednesday’s show sold out by Tuesday and, true to Kenyan tradition, there has been a rush to buy tickets even at a marked up price with just a few hours to the event. Rachman released an eBook, titled 50 True Dating Stories (from 30+ countries that will make you feel better because it could be worse) Vol 1 in May 2018. It was inspired by the awkward tales he has come across during his tour as well as the gaining popularity for the story party show. “You’ve been on enough awkward dates to master the art of fake laughing. Now come to our show and laugh for real!” signs out the event’s page on Facebook.   Too Early for Birds is a show based on stories from the blog Owaahh which shares  odd stories from the Kenyan history.
