Nairobi Stima slowed down Ushuru’s charge towards promotion to the Kenyan Premier League with a 2-1 win in their National Super League clash at Karuturi grounds on Sunday. Barack Odhiambo shot the taxmen ahead from the penalty spot on 34 minutes for a 1-0 lead at the break. Stima came back a rejuvenated side, and were level eight minutes into the second half through Gicovu Washington before Brian Musa struck the winner seven minutes to time. Ushuru remain second on 52 points, similar to leaders Western Stima who fell 1-0 to Bidco United on Saturday, after 26 rounds. The Ibrahim Shikanda-coached Stima are fourth on 49 points, one below third-placed Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) who whipped Golden Field Evangelism 3-0 on Saturday. And in Mombasa, financially-crippled Isibania held Coast Stima to a frustrating barren draw at Mbaraki Sports Club. Stima, playing before their home fans, will blame themselves for failing to utilise over a dozen scoring chances as the visitors threw men in defence to register their seventh draw this term. Coast Stima head coach Swaleh Kinero was a very disappointed man following a second consecutive draw after a 1-1 result against Ushuru last Monday in Nairobi. “I’m sure my players underrated the opponents and that over-confidence cost us the game. I’m really disappointed,” said Kinero after the game. His Isibania counterpart Samuel Owano hailed his players for a never-say-die spirit that helped them pick a point away from home to take their points tally to 19 after 25 matches. Elsewhere, Jaswel Ngugi cancelled out Wilson Njuguna’s 38th minute opener as City Stars were held to a 1-1 draw by Kibera Black Stars at Camp Toyoyo grounds.
