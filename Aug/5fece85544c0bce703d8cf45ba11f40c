Police in Keroka, Nyamira County detained two women over abortion-related crimes. Keroka police boss Eliud Muchira said the two women were seized on Friday evening from a house in Nyankoba village while in the company of two high school students who were allegedly attempting to procure illegal abortion. The police boss said officers were tipped by an informer about the incident. Mr Muchira said both the students are aged 15. One of the girls is a Form Two student in Kisii County while the other is a Form One student in Bomet County. The teens were taken to Gucha Hospital where an infant delivered by one of the girls was pronounced dead. “The other student is still bleeding heavily,” Mr Muchira said. He said the two schoolgirls will be charged in court for procuring abortion once they are out of danger.
