Nairobi County government is seeking to get a 30 per cent share from the casinos operating in the capital, through a proposal to the National Assembly contained in the Finance Bill 2018. The casinos are currently regulated by the national government under the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Act of 2017, which grants exclusive mandate to the Betting Control and Licensing Board to issue licenses and permits. County Executive for Finance Allan Igambi said the county is yet to enjoy any earnings from the sector. This is despite the licensing and enforcing of gambling, gaming and lotteries being a devolved function under the new constitution, he said. “We are currently getting no revenue but through the proposal, we are looking at a 30 per cent revenue share,” County Executive for Finance Allan Igambi said on Tuesday.

The move by the county comes four years after a similar proposal was blocked by the High Court after a casino player argued the proposal would subject them to double taxation. The gambling industry is a lucrative, with casinos making Sh 2.3 billion in in annual gross revenues last year. In the budget statement last month, the county introduced a new gambling levy on all city casinos in efforts to fund its Sh 32 billion budget for the 2018-19 financial year.
