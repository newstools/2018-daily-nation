Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general who won the Nobel Peace Prize for humanitarian work, has died aged 80 after a short illness, international diplomats say. Annan was the first black African to take up the role of the world's top diplomat, serving two terms from 1997 to 2006. He later served as the UN special envoy for Syria, leading efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. Annan's wife Nane and their children Ama, Kojo and Nina were by his side during his last days, Kofi Annan Foundation said in a Facebook post on Saturday. "Kofi Annan was a global statesman and a deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world. During his distinguished career and leadership of the United Nations he was an ardent champion of peace, sustainable development, human rights and the rule of law," reads the statement posted by the foundation. Annan was key in bringing peace to Kenya following the disputed 2007/08 General Election that quickly spiralled into violence, leaving many displaced and hundreds killed. It was Annan who brought retired President Mwai Kibaki and Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga to the negotiating table. He brokered the peace accord that formed the Grand Coalition government, ending months of violence over the disputed election results. Mr Odinga on Saturday in a phone call to Citizen TV said Annan's death is a big a loss for Africa.
