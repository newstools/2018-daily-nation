Kenya and Tanzania, both of which are pivotal members of the East African Community, being among the founders of the regional bloc are behaving badly. Just a few months after President Uhuru Kenyatta and his counterpart, Mr John Magufuli, intervened to get their ministers in charge of EAC Affairs to resolve a trade dispute, the feud is back. And this time, it’s quite crude. Kenyan traders venturing into Tanzania have reportedly been arrested and hauled to court over frivolous charges. In retaliation, some Kenyans have been barricading the Namanga highway to prevent Tanzanian traders from ferrying their produce to Nairobi. HUGE LOSSES The result is huge losses for traders on both sides that the authorities need to seriously address. These developments are a negation of the spirit of EAC co-operation. The reports of mistreatment of traders on both sides are a needless irritation in a solid co-operation pact that has seen milestones, including the common market protocol signed, and robust efforts made to remove barriers to regional trade. The two countries need each other and, of course, the other four EAC member states, too. INVESTMENT We are talking here about a market of 200 million plus that has a huge potential for trade and investment to spur regional development and prosperity. Despite the simmering differences, the two countries continue to do business, though it could be better if the sibling rivalry could be shunned. Tanzania ordered goods from Kenya worth $100 million between January and May, nearly 30 per cent higher than during the same period in 2017. By last October, Kenya’s exports to Tanzania were worth $227, sadly down from $280 million in a similar period in 2016. It’s the lowest since 2007. It is in the interest of both countries to put aside their petty differences and work together for mutual gain.
