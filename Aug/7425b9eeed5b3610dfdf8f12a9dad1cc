The proposal by Nominated MP Gideon Keter that the government should set up sports excellence centres in every part of the country is spot on. Already tabled in Parliament, the proposal also seeks to have the government put up a special stadium for rugby, a game that is fast gaining traction among the youth. It is recalled that the Jubilee Coalition promised in 2013 to put up five new stadiums, but none has been constructed so far. This is the time to actualise that pledge. But these projects will require funds, and given that they have not been factored in the current financial estimates, there must be proper planning for them. PRODUCE ATHLETES With the success of such a venture, the country will start producing more sports men and women in diverse discipline, not just athletics and football. It is noted that countries that excel at the Olympics and other major global sporting events have heavily invested in sports facilities. A lot of talent is wasted in the counties for lack of opportunities and infrastructure. If done properly, the facilities can reduce the migration of sports men and women from the counties to Nairobi. This is not a totally new idea. In the 1980s, the German government assisted Kenya to set up such centres of excellence for the Olympics. They helped to produce good athletes, footballers and boxers. For a long time, Kenya has only depended on athletics for medals at major sporting championships like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games. While it is important to renovate the existing stadiums such as Kasarani and Nyayo, the country should be investing in new ones to promote sporting activities in every region.
