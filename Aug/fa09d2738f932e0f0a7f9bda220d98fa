The government has announced that four counties in northern Kenya have been hit by an invasion of Tree and Desert locusts but assured the country that its technical team is already on the ground to fight the pests. The announcement was made Thursday by Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri when he appeared before the Committee on Agriculture and Livestock of the Senate to discuss the Irrigation Bill, 2018, which is pending before the House. The affected counties are Turkana, Isiolo, Samburu and Marsabit and the government has deployed light planes to spray pesticide to check their spread.. Mr Kiunjuri told the committee that the pests have posed a challenge because they move at night, but revealed that the government’s technical team is already on the ground containing the spread. He warned that their spread would deplete pasture Among the measures the government has deployed the establishment of a toll free telephone lines through which the public is encouraged to report the presence of the pests, surveillance, issuance of pesticide to the communities to ensure the spread is contained and the involvement of experienced institution to help in checking the spread “There is no cause for alarm because everything is under control,” Mr Kiunjuri told the committee. Tree locusts feed on tree leaves while Desert Locusts feed on pasture and the CS warned that unless checked the pests are a threat to national security. The government has set aside Sh300 million to fight pests in various parts of the country but the CS warned that by feeding on the pasture the pests could cause insecurity because livestock farmers will be forced to move out of their areas in search of the resource and this could cause conflict among communities. Mr Kiunjuri said the war on pests would ensure the government achieves its food and nutrition security agenda. “The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation has committed the amount to stop the spread of the army worm through training and the purchase of pesticides and equipment,” the CS said, warning that the pests pose a big threat to food security and livelihoods.
