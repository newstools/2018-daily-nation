The management of Visa Oshwal in Westlands, Nairobi, has started bringing down its structures built on wetlands. Oshwal Centre hired two bulldozers which started clearing part of the perimeter wall that faces Nakumatt Ukay Centre, Saturday. Part of Ukay Centre was demolished on Friday. However, Oshwal Centre manager Jinit Shah said the owners have not interfered with the flow of the river in question. “We are waiting for communication from State agencies the extent of the demolition,” Mr Shah said. Mr Shah argued that the canal was built using rainfall data received in the county and is big enough to allow natural flow of water, whatever the amount of rains.   Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, in a strongly worded statement yesterday, said only sections of the centre will be spared, including the temple and monuments, which he said are far from the river. “The rest of the structures, like the hall, which are within the stipulated riparian distance, must be removed,” Mr Sonko said. The governor said a conducive economic environment must only be fostered with the knowledge that the rule of law applies equally to all with no room for impunity, adding that the demolitions will continue but will only affect buildings that have contravened set laws and regulations.   “We are aware that some of the affected buildings were commercial centres providing employment to hundreds of Kenyans. We encourage those who were conducting businesses in these locations to re-establish their businesses elsewhere,” he said. Mr Sonko asked leaders not to use the ongoing demolitions to advance their political interests, saying together with President Uhuru Kenyatta, they are only interested in leaving a legacy by righting the wrongs that were committed in the past as they owe it to future generations.
