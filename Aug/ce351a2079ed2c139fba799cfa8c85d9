Hello Brenda, I am worried. Most people my age who have asked me out are in the not-my-type category. And lately, I seem to mostly attract married men – they hit on me and when I decide they are interesting enough to give my time, I find out they are married. There are some who are bold and tell me outright they are married, some I find out after a few dates. Is there something wrong with me? Why don’t I meet interesting single guys? I don’t want married men. Will I get a chance at dating mature single guys?  Unfortunately, there seems to be a distinct lack of mature single guys – maybe because all the mature ones are taken or married. But fear not – here's how you can do a service to yourself, and other women in your predicament. When a man tells you he is married, say YOU ARE MARRIED? Really loudly, if you're in a public place. That will stop his foolishness for other women, for at least a while, and he will not be so quick to attempt forbidden seduction because of the possible consequences (because you see, there are rarely consequences, so these married men keep doing what they keep doing). But if you're not interested in this type of community service, let's stick to your problem. What is your type, exactly? I hope it isn't the type that has a list of 24 must-haves, down to height and preferred cologne brand. Have a long, realistic look at your standards, and then try and figure out where people who meet these standards are. Another tip – hang out with your friends who are married and have good relationships that are honest and admirable. They're sure to have friends. Single ones. And, there's always dating apps? *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
