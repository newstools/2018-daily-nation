Police in Lamu are holding a 23-year-old man who has been bragging online of his alleged sexual relationships with minors. The man, who is from Kilifi County, was arrested in Mpeketoni, Lamu West, on Wednesday evening. Confirming the arrest on Thursday, County Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss Paul Leting said the man had already been interrogated but will need to be taken to Nairobi for further questioning. “It is true. We have arrested the man who has been posting messages on social media about how he engages in sexual relations with children. “We arrested him in Mpeketoni. We are moving him to Nairobi where we believe he belongs to a bigger syndicate of cybercrime and child molestation,” Mr Leting said. He called on members of the public and social media users to be alert and report such individuals to the police so that action could be taken against them. In most of his pictures that have gone viral on social media, the man, who is a guard at a local security firm, has been boasting that he is untouchable by police. In the photo captions, the man describes how he lured his victims, including a Form Two girl and a small child aged between five and six years, and what he did to them.
