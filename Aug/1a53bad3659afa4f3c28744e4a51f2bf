Kibera’s Kenneth “Kentrack” Otieno is the new Nairobi County Boxing Association chairman. The 34-year-old was elected unopposed after his challenger former National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) deputy secretary, James Chacha failed to turn up for the election that took place at Kaloleni Social Hall, Nairobi on Monday. Otieno replaces long-serving former Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) secretary David Njenga, who stepped down on the floor to declare his support for Otieno. Also elected unopposed during the process that was overseen by Rachel Ngigi and Pascaline Musau from Nairobi County government's sports ministry, were first vice chairman Kennedy “Valdez” Ochieng and second vice chairman Jamal Ali. Ochieng and Ali replace Samuel “Hitman” Otieno and Silas Mworia, who didn’t seek re-election in the process that saw 31 clubs taking part. Benjamin Musa retained his position unopposed as secretary and will be deputised by Ronald Kahinga, who was also elected unopposed. Cecilia Wairimu retained her position as treasurer just like her deputy Paul Kamuyu, as Maurice Maina was re-elected competition secretary, but has a new deputy in Hassan Abdulkadir Salim. The new committee members are Kamluz Otieno, Anne Wairimu and Kennedy Amiani. Otieno, a former kick-boxer, who has been promoting boxing for the last 15 years, declared a new dawn for Nairobi boxing. Otieno vowed to ensure that the county regains its boxing prowess with the revival of famous clubs like Muthurwa, Bahati and Maringo among others. “Many talented youth converge in Nairobi, looking for employment and we need to tap into these resources,” said Otieno, who has supported and managed boxers in the likes of Commonwealth flyweight bronze medallist Christine Ong’are. “Nairobi must come back to its feet as a force to reckon with in sports.”
