President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday slotted home a penalty kick past Kisii Governor James Ongwae in goal to officially launch the sixth edition of the Kenya Inter County Sports and Cultural Association Games at the new Gusii Stadium. Competitors from various counties started streaming into the county from Saturday and have been warming up at various venues across the county. Kisii’s executive for sports Duke Mainga said all venues had been inspected and passed fit for the games. "We have done all that was required of us to ensure we host these games successfully," Mainga said. Alongside Gusii stadium, Cardinal Otunga High School, Kisii High School, Kisii University and Kisii National Polytechnic fields have been selected for various games. The games will also include traditional ajua and tug of war contests where Kisii County will be defending their titles after winning these disciplines in Machakos last year. Kisii County’s football team, which was eliminated last year at the group stage, will open the floor against Nandi at Gusii stadium from 2pm on Monday. The home team is coached by former Harambee Stars’ striker Henry Motego who says he has introduced five new players who were not in last year’s squad to make them more competitive. "We have played several friendly matches and I promise Kisii County fans a good performance," said Motego, who turned out for Shabana FC and Kenya Breweries (now Tusker FC) in the Kenyan league before a stint in Oman. Kisumu County will, however, not take part in the events after Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said they lacked funds. "We have to cut our coat according to our size. It is unfortunate we shall not take part in the games due to lack of funds," Nyong’o said. He pointed out that the county inherited huge bills amounting to Sh3.5 billion that they were striving to reduce. "We have managed to reduce that to Sh1.8 billion currently," said the governor in Kisumu.
