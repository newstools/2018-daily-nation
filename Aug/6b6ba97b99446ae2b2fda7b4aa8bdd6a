Three dormitories have been burnt down at Rioga Secondary School in Nyamira County. Keroka OCPD Eliud Muchira said the students who were on holiday tuition at the school walked out after the fire broke out in the wee hours of Sunday morning. “We have received reports that the students have been in school for tuition and only left after the blaze,” Mr Muchira said. Mr Muchira said the fire broke at around 4.30am and property of unknown value was destroyed by the fierce inferno. The students were attending tuition almost two weeks after the second term ended despite the Education ministry outlawing holiday schooling. Masaba North education officer Ms Ann Maina said she was heading to the school from Nairobi and would soon issue a report on the fire incident. No casualties were reported during the incident and police have launched investigations.   Association questions amounts being charged to repair damages caused by students last term.
