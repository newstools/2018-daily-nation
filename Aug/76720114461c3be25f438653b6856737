Team Kenya jetted back in the country on Monday from a successful outing at the 21st Africa Athletics Championships in Asaba, Nigeria. The team was received at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by Sports PS Kirimi Kaberia, CAS Hassan Noor, Athletics Kenya (AK) Treasurer David Miano and Nairobi branch chairman Barnabas Kori, with the government promising better treatment of athletes. Team Kenya weathered the difficulties they encountered on arrival in Nigeria to chalk their best ever show since the 1982 Cairo event when they topped the medal standings in Asaba on Sunday.     The men’s 4x400m relay’s team victory gloriously wrapped up the country’s glorious outing in Asaba, Delta State, Nigeria with a haul of 19 medals: 11 gold, six silver and two bronze medals (11-6-2). "In the past we have failed you but now all things will be better organised. The way you do us proud, we shall do you proud," said PS Kaberia. Sports CAS Hassan Noor Hassan said: "We are very proud of you. The CS is very proud of you. This ministry has a different leadership and we guarantee we will make your life easier. You have made us proud for not only winning gold, but behaving well. You kept your cool and focused on getting the medals."   Team leader Abraham Mutai said the team has done Kenya proud, while Athletics Kenya vice president Paul Mutwii: "We endured a lot of suffering in Lagos but that did not deter us." AK President Jack Tuwei remained in Lagos due to ticketing issues. The team has proceeded to Weston Hotel for welcome dinner then overnight camp at Kasarani before departures on Tuesday   Flights out of Asaba on Monday morning were a bit better though a large South African contingent was still at the Asaba airport when Kenya left at 10am though the South Africans' connecting flight from Lagos was late night. Algeria will host the next African Championships in 2020.
