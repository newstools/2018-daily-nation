Connie Maina and Margaret Mwachanya, who announced their resignation from the electoral commission earlier this year, returned to their offices at Anniversary Towers in Nairobi on Friday. Details on the return of the two were not immediately made clear. A source at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission said Ms Maina and Ms Mwachanya went to agency's headquarters on Friday. “They’ve been holed up in their respective offices since they arrived,” said the source. In April, IEBC vice chairperson Connie Maina and commissioners Margaret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat said they had left the commission because they had no faith in the chairman’s leadership. Earlier this month, the High Court declared the resignation of the IEBC commissioners null and void. In his ruling, Justice Wilfrida Okwany said the commissioners failed to follow due process. Justice Okwany said the commissioners tendered their resignation through a press statement instead of writing to the appointing authority. IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati is expected to issue a statement on later today.   Connie Maina, Margaret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat cite lack of faith in chairman Wafula Chebukati.
