The Meru County government will hire youths and women in construction and maintenance of feeder roads connecting the Sh3.1 billion Eastern and Western bypasses in Meru town. The project, funded by the World Bank at a cost of Sh200 million, will be implemented through the Community Roads Empowerment (CORE) program. CORE is a non-governmental organisation which trains youth on how to improve feeder roads using Do-nou technology from Japan. The technology uses locally available materials with minimal use of machinery, creating jobs. Speaking during a consultative meeting with officials from World Bank and Japanese Government, Julius Taitumu, executive in charge of Roads, Transport and Energy said the county government would work with the financial institution to improve the roads. “We will use the technology as a way of creating employment opportunities especially to the jobless youth along the by-passes. We thank the World Bank and the Japanese government for funding the project,” he said, adding that at least 200 youths will be trained on the technology. Speaking on behalf of Governor Kiraitu Murungi, executive in charge of Legal Affairs and Public Administration r Kiautha Arithi said the youths will be drawn from the Meru Youth Service (MYS). “We established MYS with the aim of addressing joblessness among the youth and this project will help us achieve this goal,” he said. Ms Akiko Kishiue, Urban transport specialist from World Bank urged youths to register companies after training so as to benefit from that would be floated to actualize the project. “The project is keen on community participation including issues to do with conservation and aims at training the youth, which will benefit them even after the project implementation period of four years,” she said.
