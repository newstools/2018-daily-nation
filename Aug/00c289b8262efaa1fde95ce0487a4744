Police in Laikipia are questioning Nanyuki High School principal Oliver Munishi, two teachers and two education officials after a Form Four student died while attending holiday tuition. Laikipia County Police Commander Simon Kipkeu who confirmed the incident said the 19-year-old student died on Friday morning. “We understand the student who hails from Laikipia West Sub-County started feeling unwell last evening and was taken to Huruma Health Centre where he was treated. This morning he started vomiting blood and was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival,” said Mr Kipkeu. Mr Kipkeu said they are seeking to establish why the school management authorised learning yet the Ministry of Education banned holiday tuition. The six are being held at the Nanyuki Police Station. The police boss said the principal claimed that the students had been called to prepare for an education trip but the school manager could not explain why 45 students had been in school since last Friday. The education officials who are being questioned are the Laikipia East Sub-County director of education, his Teachers Service Commission counterpart and and the school cateress.
