Nairobi Gymkhana’s left arm spin bowler Raj Savala on Sunday shone with the ball, taking four wickets in a Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association Super Elite League match to help his team beat Cutchi Leva by seven wickets. Put in to bat first, Cutchi Leva batsmen failed to cope with Gymkhana’s stiff bowling and tight fielding, losing their wickets cheaply and were all dismissed for a paltry 46 in 25.3 overs of their allotted 50 overs. Dilip Rathod (18 off 53 balls with a boundary) was the only Cutchi Leva batsman who posted double-digit figures on the scoreboard. Savala was Gymkhana’s most economical bowler, taking four successive wickets and conceded two runs from his three overs that included one maiden. Savala’s victims included Kaushik Hirani whom he had caught by Rushab Patel for a golden duck. He got Mahendta Siyani caught by Rushab for a duck and clean bowled Raj Bhudia for naught. Savala’s other victim was Harshin Varsani (8 off 34 balls with a boundary) who he had caught by Harshvardhan Patel. Cutchi Leva started their innings on a sour note when Martin Okoth (4/18) got Cutchi Leva’s opening batsman, Siddarthasinh Gemawar, caught by Siddhraj Virojput for a golden duck with a score of one runs showing on the scoreboard. Amush Amin (1/8) and Abdul Najmi (1/0) were the other Gymkhana wicket takers. In reply, Gymkhana were home and dry, 48 in just 8.3 overs with seven wickets in hand. Abdul (28 off 23 balls with five boundaries) top scored for Gymkhana.Raj Bhudia (2/27) and Mahendra (1/14) were Cutchi Leva’s wicket takers. Elsewhere Swamibapa (188 for 6 in 44 overs) beat Ruaraka (187 all out in 49.1 overs) by six wickets at Nairobi Jaffreys ground and at Peponi School, Ruiru, Kanibs (207 all out in 48.3 overs) beat their hosts, Stray Lions (181 all out in 45.5 overs) by 26 runs. Internationally, batsman Reeza Hendricks smashed a century on his one-day international debut to set up South Africa’s series-clinching 78-run win over Sri Lanka in the third match in Pallekele on Sunday. Hendricks made 102 off 89 deliveries to help South Africa post 363-7 before they bowled out the hosts for 285 in 45.2 overs and took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Dhananjaya de Silva did try to infuse life into the chase with a career-best 84 but Sri Lanka’s batting crumbled under the ever-increasing run-rate. Fast bowler Lungi Ngidi claimed four wickets while fellow paceman Andile Phehlukwayo took three.
