Hi Brenda, I have a girlfriend and we have been in a relationship for two years. She joined university and I have a feeling that she might dump me for another man she is studying with. I love her and I believe she loves me but I just think she may change as I have seen many others change because we don't even have a child together. I have taken her home to my parents. Should I dump her and get another girl to marry rather than waiting to be disappointed after years in this relationship? What should I do? You cannot assume that because you have seen this happen before, it will happen to you – particularly if she hasn't given you cause to think so, which you haven't indicated. Also, you, sir, have trust issues. I don't know what happened in your past for you to have these issues, but clearly you should stay single if you can't handle the pressure of the threat of the world i.e. other humans, in your relationship. Because even if you get into a new relationship, the same problem will occur. For example, if your lady has a class project with one of these dudes you are threatened by, and they have to work late at night, in close quarters, your paranoia will go through the roof. But this can happen anywhere at any time, outside class, in class, at home, in her village, anywhere. There are men everywhere. You cannot 'protect' her from all of them. If she dumps you, it'll be because of your problems, not hers – your possessiveness. Work on that before you get into another relationship. The basis for a successful relationship is trust and communication. Talk it out. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
