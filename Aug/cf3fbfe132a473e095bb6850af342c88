A public service vehicle travelling from Elwak to Mandera town has been attacked by gunmen, eyewitnesses said on Friday. The eyewitnesses said the Toyota Land Cruiser was sprayed with bullets at the notorious Corner S near Wargadud area that is prone to terror attacks. Three passengers are said to be in critical condition while several others sustained slight injuries. Plans are underway to transport the injured to Elwak Sub County Hospital. The number of passengers who were in the vehicle when it was attacked has not yet been established. Nation efforts for confirmation from government officials including the Mandera County Commissioner Kutswa Olaka were futile after several phones calls went unanswered.   Militants claim they killed 15 security officers and injured 23 others.
