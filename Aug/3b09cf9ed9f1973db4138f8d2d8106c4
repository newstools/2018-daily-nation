Two Nakuru County Assembly members who fought within the Assembly cafeteria on Tuesday face disciplinary action. Jubilee Party on Thursday summoned nominated MCAs Jackline Wangeci Manyara and Joyce Anyiso to explain what transpired. The party's county Secretary-General Peter Cheruiyot Mtumishi directed the duo to appear before a disciplinary team on Monday next week. "You are both accused of violating ethics and integrity laws by fighting in the county assembly premises where you also used unprintable, vulgar words. "Therefore, you are hereby ordered to appear before the Jubilee Party special team at its offices in Milimani estate on Monday," the letter copied to Assembly Speaker Joel Kairu reads. DIGNITY In an telephone conversation, Mr Mtumishi said he will apprise the party's senior leadership of the outcome. Acting Speaker Philip Wanjohi raised the matter before the assembly, terming it a breach of House rules. "Such errant behaviour demeans the dignity of this House and this behaviour will not be condoned," Mr Wanjohi told the assembly. The two were separated by orderlies and their colleagues. County Police Commander Hassan Barua said the matter should be handled by the assembly and the party's disciplinary committees. "The matter should be investigated and disciplinary action taken by relevant organs in the assembly and the Party that nominated the two; because MCAs enjoy the House privileges of actions within the premises," Mr Barua said in a telephone conversation with the Nation.
