The salinity levels of the borehole water at the Tsavo East Sanctuary where 11 rhinos died shortly after being translocated there was too salty for them, a report from the Kenya Wildlife Service has shown. Fifteen analytical tests of the water quality by KWS scientists contained in a report from the agency seen by the Nation show that the level of salinity was dangerously high. The document says it fluctuated between 19,400 parts per million (ppm) and 37,400ppm between February 20 and May 22 this year, while rhinos, whose digestive mechanism compares to that of horses, can tolerate a maximum of 6,985ppm. “The results show the salinity levels for borehole onr between February 20 and May 22, 2018 were higher than the maximum recommended levels for livestock species by more than three times on some of the dates the water was tested. This may have potential risks to the rhinos … not having been exposed to saline water before. “This is evidence that its scientists had carried out water analyses over a period of time, and it was known beyond any reasonable doubt the water and vegetation were unfavourable for the survival of the rhinos,” said Union of Veterinary Practitioners national chairman Benson Kibore during a press briefing on Wednesday. “Why, then, was the translocation undertake despite overwhelming evidence against the move?” he asked.   The choice of Tsavo was informed by historical factors.
