IN MUSANZE, RWANDA It will be a battle of former champions on Friday as Kenya’s Kaya Tiwi face off with St Mary’s Kitende of Uganda in the first girls’ basketball semi-finals on day six of Brookside East Africa Secondary School Games. The other last four clash will pit defending champions Buddo Secondary School, also from Uganda, against home side St Bernadette for a place in Saturday’s final. Kaya, who finished second in Pool B, will fly Kenya’s flag in the competition after Butere Girls crashed out of the tourney at the preliminary stage. The three-time national champions face an uphill task against the 2015 regional winners, who topped Pool A of the competition. “I have faced them (Kitende) many times and they are decent side who can hurt you if given room,” said Kaya Tiwi coach Philip Onyango. Kaya, who won bronze last year, are bidding to reclaim the title they won in 2016 during their debut at the regional games in Eldoret.
