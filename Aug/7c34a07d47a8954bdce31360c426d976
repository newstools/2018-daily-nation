A senior officer in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (ODPP) has been dragged to court over corruption. Senior Principal Administrative Officer, Mr William Osoro, was charged on Friday with abuse of office and stealing. It is alleged that between September 1, 2013 and April 25, Mr Osoro arbitrarily directed the use of a fuel card for the purchase of fuel, lubricants and pit stop services valued at Sh7.9 million. It is also alleged that in the same period, with others not before court, he stole the fuel, lubricants and pit stop services, which were the property of the DPPâ€™s office. Mr Osoro denied the charges before Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi and was released on a cash bail of Sh600,000 with the alternative of a Sh1.5 million bond. The magistrate directed the prosecution to supply him with all the witness statements being used in the case. The case will be heard on September 14.   Anti-Corruption Court suspends criminal proceedings.
