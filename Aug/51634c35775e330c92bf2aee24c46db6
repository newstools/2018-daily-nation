Secondary schools national basketball and netball champions Kaya Tiwi have every reason to smile ahead of Sunday’s departure to Rwanda for East African games that start in Musanze City next week. Members of Kaya Tiwi teams Saturday received cash awards and sports equipment that will be a morale-booster ahead of the championship. Coast Regional Coordinator of Education Ndegwa Mwanyoha flagged off the teams to the championship yesterday. Mwanyoha and the school principal Robert Aran then treated the players to a luncheon at a popular Mombasa hotel. The basketball and netball players also received cash awards and sports equipment from Kwale County government and agro-based company Bixa Kenya Limited. The equipment will be used during the games in Rwanda. Mwanyoha who met the teams at his office yesterday praised the school for striking a healthy balance between sports and academics, pointing out that the school has continued to perform well in national examinations. “We have been supporting you and will continue to do so because you have continued to place Coast region in the national and regional map,” Mwanyoha said. The Kwale County Executive for Social Affairs and Talent Development Ramadhan Bungale visited the team at the school on Friday and presented them with a token of Sh20,000 and a full set of uniform to be used by the teams in Rwanda. Bungale and top officials from Kwale County pledged to reward the teams should they reclaim the regional basketball trophy which they lost to Uganda’s Buddo Senior School last year. Bixa Kenya Limited’s Finance Manager Reuben Chebii presented the teams with playing shoes and a ball and pledged to kit the teams should they emerge victorious. School principal Aran was humbled by the assistance Kaya Tiwi teams have received from the Coast region. “We have had one of the best preparations. With our young teams which have been improving every day, the sky will be the limit,” Aran said.
