South Sudan has yet another opportunity to chart a new course to political stability, peace and prosperity. This follows the signing in Khartoum on Monday of a power-sharing deal between President Salva Kiir and former Deputy President Riek Machar. It is a chance for the country to put behind its ugly legacy of a bloody conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives. The former allies, who became deadly enemies, we hope, have agreed to put pen to paper, after seriously reflecting on their own roles in this sad saga. Africa’s youngest nation, had been billed as a beacon of hope after gaining its independence from Sudan in 2011. That freedom did not come on a silver platter. It cost many lives. VAST POTENTIAL South Sudan has a vast potential, with oil reserves and agriculture, which could have a significant impact in the region. A peaceful Juba is good news, indeed, for the East African Community, having become its sixth member. The desire to see an end to the turmoil is evident in the galaxy of leaders at the signing of the agreement. Khartoum is keen to see peace restored in its neighbouring country. President Omar el Bashir, was joined by Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni and Djibouti’s Ismail Omar Guelleh, and representatives of regional and international organisations at the ceremony. POWER STRUGGLE The power struggle between Mr Kiir and Dr Machar has been devastating, with nearly 2 million South Sudanese having fled their country. The pact restores Dr Machar as the Deputy President. As he returns to Juba, which he fled several years ago, with his life in danger, preparations must begin in earnest for the refugees return home. The singular mission now is to forge unity and begin the country’s reconstruction.
