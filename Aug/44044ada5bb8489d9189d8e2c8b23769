A city businessman found guilty of murdering his girlfriend almost four years ago at Buruburu estate in Nairobi, will serve 20 years in prison. Justice Stella Mutuku said justice would be served by sentencing Erastus Ngura Odhiambo to a custodial sentence. She said she sympathised with the family of 27-year-old Linda Irungu, who was murdered on the night of December 11, 2014 by Odhiambo. Although Odhiambo regretted his actions, said the judge, nothing could be done to reverse it and her family continued living in pain after losing her. AVOIDED CONFRONTATION She added that Odhiambo could have acted differently and avoided the confrontation. Ms Irungu, a mother of one, was shot by 40-year-old Odhiambo after a quarrel outside her house in Waihura court, Buruburu Phase V. Evidence showed the two had agreed to meet at a club in Kilimani on the fateful day. Odhiambo proceeded to the club and waited for her in vain. They talked for a while as she promised to show up only for her to start ignoring his calls. SCUFFLE ENSUED The court heard that he went to the house and did not find her. This agitated him and he kept moving from the club to the house looking for her. He eventually found her as she tried to drive to her parentsâ€™ home and pulled her out of the car. A scuffle ensued and he shot her dead. The judge noted that the situation was explosive after Ms Irungu failed to join Odhiambo as promised.   Erastus Odhiambo shot dead Linda Irungu in the wee hours of December 11, 2014
