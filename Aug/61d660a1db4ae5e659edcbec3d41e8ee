The High Court has dismissed a petition seeking to declare the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) illegally composed following the resignation of four commissioners. Justice Wilfrida Okwany said a vacancy in the commission does not invalidate its composition. She further said nothing bars the commission from conducting the by-elections. The judge said the conduct of an election or a by-election is not a matter that arises out of the resolutions or decisions made by the commission at a meeting. Instead, it is dictated by the operation of the law following a vacancy in the elective positions, which are subject of the election of by-election, she said.   IEBC commissioner Roselyn Akombe says repeat election as planned cannot meet the basic expectations of a credible election. Adds that she went to New York fearing for her life.
