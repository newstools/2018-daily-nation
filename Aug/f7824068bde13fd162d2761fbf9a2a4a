Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has sacked County Secretary Francis Ominde. At the same time, Dr Ottichilo appointed Trade Chief Officer Philip Gavuna to replace Mr Ominde in acting capacity. The governor made the announcement Friday during a press briefing which was attended by Mr Ominde. The governor did not reveal the reasons for sacking the county secretary who served in the same position in Nandi County from 2013-2017. Dr Ottichilo has in the past accused Mr Ominde of leaking government documents. "I wish to bring to the attention of the staff of the county government of Vihiga and the public that Mr Francis Ominde has been relieved of his duties as the county secretary with immediate effect," said Dr Ottichilo. Also affected by the changes is Chief of Staff Noah Okaya who has been deployed to the Nairobi liaison office. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi was appointed acting Sports executive. Health Executive Amos Kutwa will also act as the Finance executive while Agriculture CEC Paul Mbuni will hold brief in the Education docket. The holders of Finance (Mr Alfred Indeche), Education (Felistus Okumu) and Sports (Marita Agufana) were recently impeached by the county assembly.
