Are you travelling to or from Nairobi by air this Friday? If yes, you may have to contact your airline because the weather is not promising a smooth take-off and landing at the capital’s two airports. The Kenya Airports Authority on Friday warned of flight delays and diversions due to heavy fog at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Wilson Airports. “Due to the current heavy fog being experienced in Nairobi, delays and diversions are expected to affect flight operations at JKIA. Please contact your airline for specific flight info,” KAA said in a tweet. “The weather conditions in the capital city have also affected operations at Wilson Airport. More updates to follow.” KAA said only one flight was affected by the fog. The flight, which was scheduled to land at JKIA at 0441hrs from Dubai, was diverted to Mombasa, according to KAA’s Air Navigation Services director Charity Musila. “Two other aircrafts made a go-around at the airport and successfully landed at the second attempt, with no difficulties,” said Ms Musila, adding that no single flight was cancelled. The fog cleared at 0930hrs and normal services resumed. “This is a normal phenomenon, which happens just about every year at this time. We are ever vigilant to ensure no mishaps happen,” she added. This is the second time this month bad weather is affecting operations at the two airports. On August 2, poor visibility caused by fog disrupted flights at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, with several planes that were scheduled to touch down at the busy airport being diverted.   Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport was again closed in less than 36 hours due to another power failure.
Flights were on Monday evening being redirected to other airports including Mombasa, Entebbe and Kigali.
