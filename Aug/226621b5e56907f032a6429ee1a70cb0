Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has declared Tuesday a public holiday to mark Idd-ul-Adha. Eid ul-Adhaa is an Islamic festival to commemorate the willingness of Abraham to follow Allah's (God's) command to sacrifice his son. Eid ul-Adha marks the end of Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. It is one of the two Eid celebrations - Eid ul-Adha and Eid ul-Fitr - and is often considered the holier of the two. During the festival, Muslims around the world will gather to mark one of the holiest days in the religious calendar. BEST CLOTHING Large groups get together to pray while enjoying feasts and wearing their best clothing. The festival, which is expected to begin in the evening of August 21, will end on August 25. Traditionally, the festival lasts for four days but public holidays vary around the world - with Arab countries observing a nine-day public holiday. During the festival, friends and family gather together to exchange gifts and money and eat traditional food. It is tradition to give gifts and be given new clothes during Eid ul-Adha. Sacrifice is a huge part of the tradition. SLAUGHTER ANIMALS In some countries, families buy, keep and slaughter their own animals. Islamic rules state the animal must be in good health and an adult. The meat from the sacrificed animal is traditionally divided into three parts. A third is kept by the family, a third is given to friends and relatives, and a third is donated to the poor.
