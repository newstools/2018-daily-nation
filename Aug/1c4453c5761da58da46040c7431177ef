Olympic 3,000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto led compatriots Emanuel Korir and Agnes Jebet in demolishing quality fields at Birmingham Müller Grand Prix on Saturday as the world celebrated the late former World 400m hurdles champion Nicholas Bett. Kipruto, who was placed fourth at the bell in 7:12.7, shot to the front, surging past compatriots Benjamin Kigei and Nicholas Kiptanui and Ethiopian Chala Beyo on the home straight to win in 8:14.33. It was Kipruto’s second victory of the season after winning in a world lead time of 8:08.40 in Rome. Beyo, who won in Doha, came in second in 8:14.61 as Kiptanui came timed 8:16.44 for third while Kigen, the Eugene and Rabat winner, settled fifth in 8:17.43. “I am dedicating my victory today here in Birmingham to our lost beloved brother Nicholas Bett. May his soul rest in peace,” said Kipruto, who is also the World, Commonwealth and Africa champion. Bett, who died on Wednesday last week in a road accident, was buried on Thursday at his home in Simat Village in Uasin Gishu County. Fresh from winning silver in 800m and gold in men’s 4x400m at the Africa Senior Athletics Championships in Asaba, Nigeria, Korir sealed his fourth victory of the season, hauling a Meet Record time of 1:42.79. Korir edged out compatriots Jonathan Kitilit and World and Commonwealth 1,500m champion Elijah Manangoi to second and third places in 1:43.53 and 1:44.15 respectively. The time by Manangoi was his personal best. “I am dedicating my Birmingham win tour to late brother Nic. He was a great role model and mentor to all who knew him, humble and a very great hardworking athlete,” said Korir, who also triumphed in Doha, Eugene and London. “We shall remember you for your inspiration to many athletes. Rest In Peace brother.” Jebet, the 2017 World 10,000m bronze medallist, stunned World and Commonwealth 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri in women’s 3,000m. Jebet, who is also the 2016 World Cross Country champion, timed 8:32.21 to triumph, beating Lilian Kasait (8:33.43) and Obiri (8:36.26) - who is fresh from winning Africa 5,000m title. Obiri had won the 5,000m in Rabat in a world lead of 14:21.75 while Kasait claimed her share of glory in the 3,000m race in London. The athletes would later be hosted by the Kenyan High Commission in London where they celebrated Bett’s life.
