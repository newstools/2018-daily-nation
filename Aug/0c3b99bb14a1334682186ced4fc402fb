Police officers have threatened to boycott work over being swindled allowances after providing safety during the Kenya Music Festivals in Nyeri. The officers claimed that their bosses gave them less money, contrary to what they are owed. The claim they had been promised Sh22,000 each for the 10 days they were posted at Dedan Kimathi University grounds during the events, only to be given Sh4,500 on Thursday. They said their bosses had received the dues from the event organisers. "We want what was promised to us. They were to give us Sh2,200 per day and now they are giving us Sh4,500. We know our bosses pocketed our dues," an officer who did not want to be named said. DISCIPLINE There was a standoff at the university as the officers defied orders to return to their areas of deployment. Some were heard threatening to boycott the presidential gala scheduled for Friday. However, Nyeri County Commissioner Fredrick Shisia has denied the claims. Mr Shisia said there was no agreement on the amount each officer should receive. "There were no negotiations on the amount in the first place. The amount they are claiming is an escalation. Besides, they will not be paid until Saturday when the activities end," Mr Shisia said. The County Security Committee chair said the officers who will go on strike will be disciplined. The 173 officers were drawn from the Kenya Police, Administration Police, Kenya Prisons and Directorate of Criminal Investigations, and were tasked with patrols, screening guests, crowd control as well as undercover surveillance.   Finalists are expected to wow audiences ahead of performances at Sagana State Lodge on Friday.
