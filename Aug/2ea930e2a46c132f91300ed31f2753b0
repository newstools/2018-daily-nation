An advocate is seeking to have the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) Chief Executive Officer Mercy Wambua sacked. Mr Edward Oringe Waswa wants Ms Wambua kicked out over alleged “incompetence and abuse of office.” In a notice of motion to the LSK secretary dated August 23, Mr Waswa states that: “Take notice that the undersigned will move this motion at the special general meeting of the society to be convened on September 15, 2018.” The advocate accuses Ms Wambua of “financial misconduct.” MEDICAL COVER He alleges that Ms Wambua approved and facilitated the transfer of Sh5,822,405 to an insurance company as renewal of the staff medical cover for the period July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 while the insurer delivered an invoice of Sh441,796 to the society. “The payroll system of the secretariat staff has been infiltrated by fictitious persons,” Mr Waswa adds. He also accuses the CEO of facilitating the procurement of 46 fire extinguishers in June 2018 “against a secretariat of staff of 31 employees at a cost of Sh978,655.” “Unknown to society members, the salaries of staff members were increased by 50 per cent without considering performance appraisals,” says Mr Waswa. MALICIOUS Ms Wambua, however, said the allegations by the advocate were “false and malicious.” “I confirm that those allegations are false and malicious. I have referred the same to my lawyers,” she told the Nation on Saturday. She, however, said that the LSK council would consider the motion. As the CEO, Ms Wambua is the secretary to the council whose membership also includes the LSK President Allen Gichuhi and his deputy Ms Harriette Chiggai among other members.
