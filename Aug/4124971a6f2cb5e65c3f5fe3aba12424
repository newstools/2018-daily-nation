A parliamentary report showing the pathetic conditions some of our compatriots representing the country abroad have to endure is depressing. These are the people who are expected to project a good image of our country. Having salaries always delayed and embassies in a dilapidated condition is a crying shame. Compiled by the National Assembly’s Committee on Defence and Foreign Relations, the report indicates that Kenyan missions in nine countries are in a deplorable state. Ironically, they include one of our most important foreign missions — the Kenyan Embassy in Washington, DC, in the United States. This is inexcusable, considering the premium attached to our relations with the US, which only this week saw President Uhuru Kenyatta in Washington to hold crucial talks with his counterpart, Mr Donald Trump. NATIONAL CHARACTER The mess has also been chronicled in other key embassies and high commissions. In some missions, recalled staff have not been replaced, creating shortages and others lack the funds to operate effectively. It does not make sense to open many posts and deploy staff but not properly cater for them. In a nutshell, our diplomatic service is in a shambles. The practice in diplomatic service is to reorganise and consolidate some of the smaller missions. Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma had better wield the whip to streamline operations in her docket. The staff abroad have a key role to play in promoting national interests. The aim is not to create overseas jobs for relatives and cronies of the big shots. There is a need to rationalise staffing and maintain lean, effective, and well-resourced teams. Kenyan envoys cannot conduct themselves with dignity when their basic needs are not met. Embassies must reflect our national character and pride and never be centres of doom and gloom.
