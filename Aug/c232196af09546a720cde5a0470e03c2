Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho on Saturday paid a courtesy call to retired President Daniel Moi at his Kabarak home in Nakuru County. Details of the closed-door meeting were scanty but Mombasa county official Idris Abdiraham said the governor was in Kabarak to get a "word of wisdom" from Mzee Moi. In attendance were MPs Omar Mwinyi (Changamwe), Mishi Mboko (Likoni) and Teddy Mwambire (Ganze). Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua and Kanu party secretary general Nick Salat were also in attendance. UNITY PACT Mr Abdiraham said Mr Joho is on his way to visit Samburu and Baringo counties for fundraising events this weekend. The visit comes barely two months after Mr Joho hosted Baringo Senator Gideon Moi in Mombasa where the two announced a unity deal ahead of 2022. The two leaders, who have both declared interest in the presidency in the next General Election, said they will unite “in changing the people’s lives.” The Kanu party chairman termed the ODM deputy leader is an “extremely important person in the political equation of the country.” The two leaders said they will also traverse the country in their bid to “unite Kenyans” and build bridges. Governor Joho said he will closely involve Mr Moi’s party in leadership matters.   Sources say DP and entourage waited for some time before leaving.
