Twenty years is quite a long time but the painful memory of the terrorist bomb attack in Nairobi’s city centre remains quite vivid in the minds of many Kenyans. In this one brutal incident in what had always been a peaceful city, 224 people perished and 4,000 others were injured. For many of the survivors and the bereaved families, August 7 is the day their lives drastically changed. TERRORISM WAR The attack on the American embassy thrust Kenya deep into the terrorism war and there have been several other bloody ones. They include the 2015 Garissa University College slaughter of nearly 150 students and the 2013 massacre at Westgate Mall, Nairobi, in which more than 60 people perished. But the bold message to the masterminds is that the resolve of Kenyans to continue with their lives will not be broken by such cowardly attacks. But even more significant is the resolve to remain vigilant and avert a recurrence. Quite impressive, though, is the solidarity demonstrated by Kenyans after such attacks. A similar commitment should go into fighting terrorism. SOLIDARITYThe painful memories of the August 7 bombing is somewhat eased by the support the United States government has given to the survivors and the bereaved families following the callous onslaught against people who had done nothing wrong. But there have been murmurs that some victims might not have got the compensation they deserved. It’s certainly not too late to redress such a situation. However, this dreadful anniversary should remind all of us that we live in a world where some people, filled with hate for whatever reason, will readily sacrifice even their own lives to inflict pain on others. Terrorism is an evil force that can only be defeated through solidarity.
