Onkar Rai set the fastest of the day in the opening session of the Chloride Exide Hill Climb event to lead the overall standings of the competition. Rai, who is sponsored by Menengai Oil, led after three heats of the two days competition with a scorching 3minutes 09.079 seconds in the 4WD class. "I am actually enjoying myself to the highest level. The competition has been exciting with drivers like Ian Duncan closing on me. Let's see what the final day of action brings in today. My plan is to win it outright if all goes well," said Rai. Karan Patel rolled his car at a fast left hairpin corner while lying a strong second. His car will not be able to take part in the last day of the event. National Motocross champion, Shivam Vinayak is the best-placed motor cycle rider in the third place, behind the 4WD car of Ian Duncan. “The day started off well. The heats went well without the issues of the rain falling. I am pleased with the whole performance so far,” said Gurvir Bhamra, the Hill Climb Event Director.
