Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has denied fraud and abuse of office charges when he appeared before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti on Thursday. Dr Kidero, former Nairobi County Treasury boss Maurice Okere and seven others were accused of leading to the loss of Sh213,327,300 between January 16, 2014 and January 25, 2016. They allegedly conspired to commit corruption by authorising payment to various companies for services not rendered. Dr Kidero allegedly received a total of Sh24 million from Lodwar Wholesalers Ltd on diverse dates. BOND REQUEST Mr Okere also denied charges of authorising several payments for services not rendered. Defence lawyers applied for the accused to be released on bond. At the same time, Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti directed the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court registry not to receive charges after 8.30am. Mr Ogoti said he "has noted the habit of prosecution bringing suspects to court late in the day". The application was filed by Dr Kidero's lawyer Tom Ojienda. The court has adjourned for bail ruling.   Allegations include abuse of office, money laundering and bribery.
