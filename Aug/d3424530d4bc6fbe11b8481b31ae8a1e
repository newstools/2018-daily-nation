MANCHESTER Paul Pogba assumed the responsibility of captain handed to him by Jose Mourinho to help Manchester United get off to a winning start in the Premier League with a 2-1 win over Leicester City on Friday. Less than a month since Pogba scored in the World Cup final to help France lift the trophy, he was thrown straight into action by Mourinho and his third-minute penalty put United on course for victory. Luke Shaw's late second sealed the points before Jamie Vardy headed home a consolation for the visitors.
