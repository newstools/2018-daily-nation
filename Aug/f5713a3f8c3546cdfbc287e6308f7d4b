With no fresh injections into the service, and the looming exit of civil servants who were retained, there was bound to be a gap in the transition. The worry about the impending loss of skilled and experienced personnel and the difficulty in getting ready replacements presents a big challenge. Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia has set in motion a process that should less disruptions in the delivery of services.

The data should be submitted to the ministry by September 28.

BLOATED WAGE BILL It is so important because it will enable proper planning. The audit also presents an opportunity to deal with the perennial problem of the bloated government wage bill, which has been lately distorted further by the excessive recruitment in the 47 counties. What is required in a lean and effective public service. Prof Kobia and her team have an opportunity to evaluate capacity gaps and put in place a succession plan in order to strengthen the civil service.
