Dear Brenda, I have been married for three years now. We had a somewhat happy marriage for this past three years until when my wife recently got a job. She doesn’t do anything in the house these days in the pretext that she is tired and I should acknowledge she also works too. She rarely cooks supper, prepares breakfast or does any household chores. Our sex life has died since with the kind of arrogance and rudeness she directs to me it’s even hard for me to think of sex. Right now it’s like she is ruining my life because she can never follow what I say. She opposes my ideas because “she has her own money”. I am thinking of jumping ship but I worry for my three-year-old son. He’s the only one keeping this marriage intact.  Stop acting like it is your wife's specific obligation to do household chores. You live in that house too. You have hands. You can do chores. If laundry and food are a problem, outsource. There are people who deliver these things with entire meal plans, or, househelps. A marriage should be 50-50. If she is lacking in some area, you should be the one to step up because no one else will. Imagine she is tired from work. This is a thing that happens to women, the same way it happens to men. Please get used to the new world order to save your marriage, is my first recommendation. Communicate your discomfort and then work on it together. For the sex – deal with this problem of your sexism first before we even get to sex. Jumping ship because of a small obstacle like this is immature. Either that or wait until your three year old can do chores, in about 7 years... *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
