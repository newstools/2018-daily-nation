Kenya junior coach Mike Amenga is confident of qualifying for next year’s Africa Under-17 Cup of Nations. He spoke to Nation Sport on Wednesday moments before the team flew out to Tanzania for the Cecafa Regional qualifiers for the 2019 Africa Under-17 Cup of Nations. Winner of this 10-nation regional tournament will gain a ticket to the continental final in Tanzania. The Cecafa region will be allowed to field three teams at the African tourney in the event Tanzania - who have an automatic slot as hosts - emerge champions. “We have adequately prepared and I’m confident we will do better than our fourth place finish at the Cecafa U-17 Championships in Burundi,” said Amenga. This Cecafa regional qualifier will be staged between Saturday and August 26 at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam, with Kenya’s Junior Stars slated to face South Sudan on August 14 in their opening fixture. Amenga will rely on forwards Matthew Mwendwa and Ezekiel Magendi, students at Anointed High School and Bahati School respectively for the hunt for goals. Cecafa Secretary General Nicholas Musonye has in the mean time warned teams of severe punishment should they age cheat. “I know the temptation is always there to field men in this tournament and yet we are working very hard to nurture the next generation of Victor Wanyama and Dennis Oliech from this region. We will disqualify any team that dares break the rules which are very clear,” said Musonye. Kenya will play Djibouti, Ethiopia and Uganda in the preliminary stage.
