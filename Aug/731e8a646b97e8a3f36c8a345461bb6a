The violent protests in Uganda in the past few days following the arrest of some politicians paint a gloomy picture of the country and the region. While it’s the duty of the government to enforce law and order, its instruments of legal force must always be used fairly and should never target certain groups or individuals for ulterior motives. Of serious concern to other East Africans and the international community, therefore, is what appears like an attempt by the government to stifle the freedom of expression. The politicians are reportedly being held on trumped-up charges arising from statements made at election campaign rallies. Quite commendable, however, is Thursday’s decision to drop the charges in a military court against an MP. This is a matter the civilian courts can easily handle. MILITARY DICTATORSHIP Generally, the authorities have firmly dealt with the lawless individuals who have been engaging security personnel in running battles in which several people have been injured. Sadly, though, even some journalists doing their legitimate duty of reporting on the chaos have found themselves on the receiving end of brutal beatings by security personnel. It’s commendable, however, that the suspects have been taken through due process and allowed to be represented by lawyers of their choice in the courts. Also laudable is an official apology by the military for the excessive force used by some of its personnel. These should be investigated and soldiers found to have committed atrocities against unarmed civilians punished. The threat of Uganda’s degeneration into violence reversing the gains in its democratisation over the past three decades since it emerged from a bloody military dictatorship must be stopped.
