KINSHASA The Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday reported an outbreak of Ebola in the east of the vast country, barely a week after it had declared the end to an outbreak in the northwest. "At this point, there is no indication that these two epidemics, which are more than 2,500 kilometres (1,500 miles) apart, are connected," Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga said in a statement.   Outbreak could be declared over after 42 days without a new confirmed case, DR Congo minister says.
