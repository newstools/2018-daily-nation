He was promptly arrested and locked up at Bamburi Police Station. Mr Kamitu said the man will be escorted back to Kitui to face charges of misusing a government vehicle. Earlier, police found Mr Nzau’s official vehicle but Mr Kang’oti was nowhere to be seen. Mombasa police commander Johnston Ipara said the vehicle was found abandoned in Likoni. “We are yet to get the driver. We are working to know who was the driver.
