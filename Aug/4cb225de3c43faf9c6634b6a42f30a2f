Kenya’s number one sport, football, is facing a serious crisis. It needs concerted efforts by Football Kenya Federation (FKF), the government and stakeholders to save it. It’s sad Harambee Starlets suffered first round shock elimination from the Cecafa Women Championship in Rwanda, following a 1-0 defeat to Ethiopia in last month. The elimination came just after Starlets were also eliminated from the 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations when they lost to Equatorial Guinea 3-1 a month earlier. DREAMS SHATTERED Moreover, Kenya’s dream of gracing the 2019 African Nations Under-17 (boys) finals were shattered after the team fell 4-2 to Ethiopia in their final qualifying match in Dar es Salaam last weekend. Ethiopia sailed through alongside Uganda. Harambee Stars have already lost one match to Sierra Leone in Group F of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier where they will meet Ghana and Ethiopia in home and away basis. Losing to Sierra Leone in a match where they were favourites put Stars at the back foot. TAP TALENT This sad story simply explains how standards of football have sunk to oblivion in the country despite the enormous talent around. Kenya’s soccer development has for long suffered either due to lack of interest from the government and poor leadership at the FKF. We need full-fledged centres for sports excellence across the country to tap talent not only in soccer but other sporting disciplines. Sports ministry ought to be serious in implementing the 2013 Sports Act where funds need to be raised to support national teams and sports development.
