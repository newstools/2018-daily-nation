Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent “Namcos” Simiyu’s job has been advertised. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) advertised for the post alongside all other positions in the team’s technical bench including strength and conditioning coach, physiotherapist and team manager. Simiyu and his compatriots Geoffrey Kimani (Conditioning Coach), Lamech Bogonko (Physio), Erick Ogweno (Team Manager) will now have to re-apply for their positions. The technical bench’s last assignment with the team was at the Rugby World Cup Sevens on July 20 -22 in San Francisco, USA, where the team finished a distant 16th, a pale shadow of the side that had reached the semi-finals at the 2009 and 2013 events. According to a statement from the Union on Wednesday evening, the interested parties must submitted their applications not later than September 7, this year. All applications should be addressed to the Chief Executive Officer at ceo@kru.co.ke. KRU director of rugby Thomas Odundo disclosed that the tenure of the current technical bench expires at the end of October this year, hence they are at liberty to re-apply for their respective positions. Odundo said the shortlisting and selection will be done before the end of September with the new technical bench taking over before this year’s Safari Sevens due November 9-11 at the RFUEA grounds. Asked whether foreign coaches will be considered for application, Odundo stated: “Our options are open but we shall still review our options basing on what we can afford.”   The Simbas will launch their quest against Canada on November 11.
