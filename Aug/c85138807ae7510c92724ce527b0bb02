Flight services at the Kisumu International Airport were on Saturday night allegedly disrupted by a power hitch that affected the runway lights. Despite the Nation confirming the disruption with several passengers who were affected and taxi operators, the airport manager Salina Gor insisted the “runway lights were fully operational.” Jambojet and Fly540 passengers who were scheduled to depart the airport on 8:30pm flights had to spend the night in Kisumu. Ms Jackline Owala, one of the passengers affected by the disruption, said they boarded their Jambojet plane to Nairobi on Sunday morning. A Kenyan Airways official who declined to be named referred the Nation to the Kenya Airports Authority.
