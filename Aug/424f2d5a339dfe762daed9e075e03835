HARDWORKING Speakers at the funeral condoled the family and praised the fallen soldier, saying he was a hardworking and humble young man. “The attack robbed me of a great, industrious, ambitious, humble and hardworking friend and son. I was really heartbroken by the news of his death. May he rest in peace,” said his mother, Ms Kabilo Cheserem, amid tears. She went on: "I will miss you my son, you had big dreams. Nevertheless all is well with my soul; let your soul rest in the hands of our God.’’ GRIEF Mourners sobbed uncontrollably during the emotional send-off with many fainting in grief.
