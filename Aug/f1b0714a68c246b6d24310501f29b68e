Officials from the Kenya Revenue Authority seized Sh2.9 million heroin at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The drugs were concealed in African crafts, according to officials. KRA said the narcotics, which originated from Mbarara, Uganda and was destined for Delta State, Nigeria, were found at a DHL yard after enforcement officers on a routine check found a suspicious package that was scanned at the customs laboratory. The use of couriers has emerged as a new modus operandi employed by drug smugglers, KRA said in a statement. Thursday's interception comes days after the KRA seized several packages of narcotics concealed as vitamin tablets at JKIA. The narcotics had also been sent as a parcel using an international courier service provider. KRA said the package was handed over to the Anti-Narcotic Police Unit for further investigations.   Seized narcotics sent through a courier service provider and declared as candy.
