Kenya Pipeline Company’s emergency team has started repairing its Sinendet-Kisumu pipeline following an oil seepage in Kisumu’s Kibos area. KPC Managing Director Joe Sang’ in a statement said the spillage was occasioned by a suspected siphoning of fuel by a “rogue trader.” “Following the leak that was discovered today at around 1.00pm, the pipeline popularly referred to as Line 6 was immediately isolated to enable the repairs to kick off,” Mr Sang said. The company’s safety and environment team, he said, had also taken over the site to stop the product from spreading further. “We urge the residents who are in close proximity to the leak area to immediately move to safer areas to enable KPC undertake the repairs to minimise danger.” “We will work closely with the police and other relevant arms of government to ensure that the culprits of this dreadful act are arrested and brought to book,” said Mr Sang’. Dozens of Kisumu residents on Friday scooped fuel from the leaking pipeline near Kondele on the Kibos-Kisumu highway. Oblivious of the dangers of their act, the residents were seen scooping the fuel into jerrycans. Security officers led by Kisumu Central Deputy County Commissioner John Cheruiyot and Administration Police Commander Benjamin Koima visited the scene and said investigations had been launched to ascertain the cause of the spillage.   Oblivious of the dangers of their act, the residents were seen scooping the fuel.
