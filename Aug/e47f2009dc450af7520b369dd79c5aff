President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that the demolition of properties built on riparian lands will go on. The president added that officials who made approvals for the premises to be built on such lands will be punished. “We are doing everything to discourage corruption. It is possible to do clean business in Kenya, this is what we want to encourage,” the President tweeted on Thursday. The President’s sentiments come even as the demolition of buildings in Nairobi continues. The demolitions started on Monday as the National Environment Management Authority (Nema) set out to reclaim illegally occupied wetlands in the city. The national environment watchdog demolished structures on riparian land in Nairobi’s Kileleshwa area. RESIDENTIAL HOUSES As the demolitions entered day two on Tuesday, residential houses built on Ring Road Kileleshwa were targeted. President Kenyatta’s resolve on the demolitions came at the same time with that of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko who Thursday said he is ready to be a one-term governor but ensure that Nairobi regains its glory. He said that he will ensure that all properties built on waterways, road reserves and riparian land are removed. LEAD BY EXAMPLE Governor Sonko said that the law should not be applied selectively and that he is ready to lead by example, adding that even his own property in Buru Buru, which has been built on a road reserve, will also be brought down. On Wednesday, the purge moved to Lang’ata where South End Mall located at the junction of Mbagathi and Lang’ata roads and which is built on riparian land was demolished. National Youth Service bulldozers descended on the mall at 3am under the watchful eye of the police, with tenants pleading to be given time to remove their properties.   Sonko says his own property in Buru Buru, which is on a road reserve, will also be brought down.
