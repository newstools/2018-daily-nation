Uganda are the champions of the Council of East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa) Zone Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) U17 qualifiers. The Uganda Cubs edged out Ethiopia 3-1 in a one-sided final at National stadium, Dar es Salaam on Sunday to qualify for the continental junior finals slated for May next year in Tanzania. Tanzania, who finished third by beating Rwanda 1-0 in a third-place playoff, qualify as hosts and will be joined by six other nations from other regions within the continent at the final tournament, whose top three teams qualify for the 2019 Fifa U-17 World Cup in Peru. In the final attended by Caf president Ahmad Ahmad among other dignitaries, Samson Kassozi fired Uganda into the lead at the quarter hour mark for a 1-0 lead at the break. Uganda resumed to pick up from where they had left in the opening stanza with Idd Abdul Wahid doubling the lead a minute after the hour mark. The youngster completed his brace five minutes to the final whistle. Ethiopia pulled a consolation from the penalty spot via Mintensnot Wakjira two minutes into added time. Uganda eliminated hosts Tanzania 3-1 to reach the final, while Ethiopia had knocked out Rwanda 4-2 on post-match penalties after a two-all draw after extra time. Kenya fell to both Uganda (3-1) and Ethiopia (4-2) in Group B matches.
