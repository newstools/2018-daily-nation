Families and relatives of the three fishermen who went missing in the Indian Ocean five days ago after their boat capsized in Kiwayu Island in Lamu want the Kenya Navy involved in the search. A search operation has been ongoing in Kiwayu since Thursday last week but no single body has been recovered. The mission is being conducted by the Lamu County government search and rescue team in coordination with the Kenya Maritime Authority, marine police and local divers. Speaking to the Nation on Monday, the families and relatives expressed fears their kin are dead and their bodies might decompose and get lost in the ocean. Mr Omar Bwana said they have been a worried lot since they were informed of the capsized boat. “We want their bodies so that we can bury them decently. I believe the Kenya Navy officers are well trained. If they join this team I am sure the bodies will be traced and recovered,” said Mr Bwana. On Sunday, Lamu County Transport Manager Haji Mahmoud said the search mission was ongoing but was being hindered by strong winds and tides at Kiwayu. He called on the residents to be patient as the operation continues. Four fishermen from Kizingitini village in Lamu East were heading to the high seas in Kiwayu and Ndau to fish on Thursday when their boat christened ‘Subira’ capsized. Only one fisherman, Mr Omar Shali, swam to safety and alerted the Kiwayu chief. The missing fishermen have been identified as Athman Ali Gogo, Balali Shali and Huri Kale Shebwana.
