Motorists plying Naivasha-Nakuru highway were stuck on the road for more than five hours Friday evening following heavy traffic jam. The gridlock blocked both lanes of the highway as impatient motorists overlapped, completely paralysing traffic flow despite traffic officers efforts to ease the situation. A motorist, Timothy Siran, who was headed to Nakuru from Narok said he been stuck in the jam from around 5pm. "I have been virtually rooted in the same spot for almost four hours," said Mr Siran. The snarl-up stretched from Naivasha town to the Gilgil Weighbridge, almost 17 Kilometres away. "We have children inside our vehicles and they are really suffering. It is very frustrating," added Mr Siran. A senior traffic officer tasked with easing the traffic jam accused some impatient motorists of exacerbating the situation. "They have blocked all the entry and exit routes even on the earth roads, making it extremely had to command traffic flow," said the officer, who declined to be named.
