Police in Kitui are searching for the official car of Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau and his driver Anthony Kang'oti, who went missing on Thursday evening in Mwingi. Mr Kang'oti is said to have vanished with the car soon after taking Dr Nzau to the requiem mass of the 10 pupils who perished in a road accident in Mwingi. Detectives have been tracking the car— a Land Cruiser Prado TX, Dark Grey in colour, registration number KBW 893V with a green number plate— since the case was reported. The County Transport Officer told the Nation that the driver's phone signal had been traced to Kiembeni Bamburi estate in Mombasa County.  More follows.
