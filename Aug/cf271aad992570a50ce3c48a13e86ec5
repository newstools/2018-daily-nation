Government has released Sh1.4 billion to pay maize farmers for deliveries made to the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) last year. On Monday Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, under whose docket management of food reserves falls, asked farmers to visit their respective NCPB depots to verify their payment details. Mr Wamalwa said the vetting should be completed by this Friday for the payment process to begin. The money is part of the Sh3.5 billion that the government owes farmers. Last week, the Chief Administrative Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture Andrew Tuimur said only vetted farmers will benefit from the cash. In April the government vetted afresh farmers after it was discovered that there were unscrupulous traders who supplied cheap imported grain from Uganda to benefit from the government price of Sh3,200 per 90 kilo bag. Growers supplied over 4.3 million bags of maize to the board in the last season crop.
