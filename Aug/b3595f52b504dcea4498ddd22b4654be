A report by the Auditor-General Edwin Ouko, tabled in the National Assembly by Leader of Majority Leader Aden Duale, shows that over 80 firms received money from the Sports ministry. The ministry is on the spot for failing to account for Sh1.7 billion used in last year's IAAF Under-18 World Youth Championships in Nairobi. The National Assembly Public Accounts Committee, chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi, will consider the report, which shows that Sh349.6 million was incurred through direct procurement, against the Public Procurement and Disposal Act of 2015. About Sh66 million was controversially set aside for the procurement of taxi services, and Pewin Cabs Ltd was paid Sh66 million above the market rate, the report says. “This company was also given a dry cleaning and laundry services contract valued at Sh30.8 million,” he adds. Here is a list of the firms and the amount of money each received from the Sports ministry.
