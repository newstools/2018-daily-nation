The row over the recent deaths of more than 10 rhinos that were translocated to Tsavo National Park from Nairobi and Nakuru is getting needlessly messy with accusations and name calling that only distract attention from the core business. What Kenyans would want to hear is that tangible steps have been taken to prevent similar incidents. But with the death of yet another black rhino at the hands of suspected poachers, the matter is getting murkier. SOLID EXPLANATION It’s disappointing, therefore, that Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala, who should be giving a solid explanation and an assurance about the protection of endangered wildlife, has chosen to wage a verbal war against some personalities, bluntly telling them to go to hell. Such acidic language should not camouflage the real issue at hand, which is the need to conserve our wildlife, especially the endangered species such as rhinos. It’s commendable that over the years a lot of work has gone into conservation of wildlife, which is not just a vital part of our solid heritage but is also at the core of our tourism, a major source of revenue for the country. CRUCIAL BUSINESS We do not need the sideshows by the people from whom a lot more is expected in the crucial business. This is an area in which we, as a country, have impeccable expertise and experience. The ugly spats by the officials are totally uncalled-for because it is quite easy to establish what went wrong and ensure that it does not happen again. Mr Balala and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) leadership must take advantage of the conservation capacity to address any challenges and put the country back on track. Nobody, not even the CS, is indispensable, and if they choose to quarrel and take their eyes off their mandates, thus threatening a national treasure, they must give way so that others can run the show.
