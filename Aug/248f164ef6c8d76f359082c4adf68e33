Nairobi City businessman Erastus Ngura Odhiambo, alias Baba Billy, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for murdering his girlfriend Linda Wanjiku Irungu four years ago. Mr Odhiambo, a bar owner, was last Friday found guilty of shooting dead the 27-year-old lawyer in the wee hours of December 11, 2014 in Buru Buru Phase 5 in Nairobi. Justice Stellah Mutuku said Odhiambo committed the offence after visiting Irungu's house thrice on the fateful night after she declined to join him for a night out. The judge said when Odhiambo found Ms Irungu trying to drive out of her compound, he dragged her out of the car then shot her after a struggle as two guards watched.  More follows.
