Three Kenyan players are among the 12 dismissed for attempted age cheating ahead of the Africa Under-17 Championship qualifier that started on Saturday in Tanzania. An MRI scan by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) caught the young men as Kenya prepared for their opening campaign on Monday against South Sudan. That followed a similar scrutiny by Football Kenya Federation (FKF) before the team left for Tanzania. The shameful act not only puts the country in the global limelight for the wrong reasons, but also exposes the FKF on its sincerity in addressing age cheating in local football — an issue that people talk about in hushed tones, with FKF not addressing it firmly. INJURIES This is not the first time Kenya has been caught cheating. CAF banned its Under-20 team in 2016 after overage players were fielded in their 1-1 draw with Sudan in the Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations qualifier. The Under-17 team was banned for two years by the continental body due to age cheating after they eliminated Ghana 3-2 on aggregate in the Africa Youth Championship qualifier in 2003. This vice has also, in the long run, left many players not recovering from injuries on time after receiving the wrong treatment. TALENT With Kenya’s enormous football talent, FKF should not tolerate age cheating. The federation does not have functioning structures to help the country to develop the talent, hence leaving players to exploit loopholes in age control. In developed footballing countries, there are leagues at every age group, which are run professionally and young players sprout from every season. You can rarely witness incidents of age cheating with such structures in place. The FKF must protect our players from this killer of careers.
