Faith-based drug supplier Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS) is blaming government directive to process imported goods at the Nairobi inland container depot for Sh114 million loss. According to Managing Director Jane Masiga, the organisation suffered stock outs on 201 lines of drugs over the past seven months due to delayed clearance leading to Sh114 million in lost sales to counties, national government and faith-based health facilities. “Due to the congestion at the Nairobi inland depot, consignments are taking weeks to clear and that affects our stocking since we are not able to replenish in good time,” she said. Speaking during the annual MEDS suppliers’ conference held at its head offices in Nairobi, Dr Masiga added that delayed payments had worsened the situation. Dr Masiga said delayed payments by health facilities had forced MEDS to start negotiations with its suppliers to extend credit period from between 30 and 60 days to 90 days to sustain supply.
