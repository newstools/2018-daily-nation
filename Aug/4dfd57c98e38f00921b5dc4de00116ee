The burial of former world 400m hurdles champion Nicholas Bett, whose stellar career came to a tragic end when he died in a road accident on Wednesday, has been brought forward from Friday to Thursday next week at his Simat home in Uasin Gishu County. Athletics Kenya Central Rift Branch chairman Abraham Mutai said the family had confirmed the change of burial date. Bett had landed a deal with Fenerbahce Istanbul in Turkey. He went to Simat Primary School before joining Paul Boit High School where they were transferred to Cheptil High School before getting an opportunity to serve in the National Police Service.   “Bett was a great man and that is why everyone who knew him wants to be involved.”
