A hospital in Kisumu has suspended a doctor for allegedly demanding additional pay to treat a defiled patient. The mother of the four-year-old girl claimed the doctor asked for Sh150,000 before carrying out the surgery. "Since the defilement my daughter developed fistula. She had undergone four procedures to correct the problem. "We had booked for an appointment with (the doctor) on Tuesday for restoration of the colon to its usual position. But I was surprised when he demanded that we pay the amount before he proceeds with operation," she said. "Since the case was reported, the gender department has been taking care of the treatment of my daughter. Over a year she's developed further complications." STIGMA The girl had already undergone corrective surgeries after she was sexually assaulted in September 2017 in Manyatta Slum. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital Medical Superintendent Peter Okoth confirmed that the doctor was suspended. "It was quite unfortunate and we are surprised that the doctor was asking for money for a surgical procedure that does not warrant any pay," Dr Okoth said. "We did not have any issues with the charges. We want the child back so that we have the reversal surgical procedure done." The mother said that the child is distressed due to stigma and her education has stalled. "It pains me a lot when I see her in distressed. She can't go to school with her condition. Furthermore, the culprit who did this to her is at large," she added. A member of the county's executive committee for health, Ms Roselyn Obara, also said the doctor has been interdicted.
