Mr Charles Ong’injo is the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) Maseno South Diocese bishop-elect. Mr Ong’injo trounced two others in an election held at ACK St Stephen’s Cathedral in Kisumu on Saturday. He succeeds the long-serving Bishop Mwayi Abiero who took to the throne in 1994 and is set to retire on November 4, 2018. Mr Ong’injo emerged the winner after beating Zephaniah Kore and Boniface Obondi in a hotly contested election which was decided on the third round. TRANSPARENT PROCESS “I can assure the congregation that the election has been conducted in a free, fair and transparent process,” said Mr Ambrose Weda, a lawyer who presided over the process. He called on the members to support the leadership of the church to ensure that it unites the members. The bishop-elect promised to closely work with his opponents after months of campaigns that saw the church members divided. ELECTORAL COLLEGE The outgoing vicar-general of St Stephens Cathedral in Kisumu was elected by a 23-member electoral college. Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o hailed the Church for conducting a peaceful election and exhibiting high-level faith. “Following a successful, peaceful and inclusive canonical election of the Anglican Church of Kenya, Diocese of Maseno South, I take this early opportunity to congratulate the bishop-elect,” he said.   Four Anglican bishops have shown interest in replacing the church leader in the country, Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi, whose term has expired.
