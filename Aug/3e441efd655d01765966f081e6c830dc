Police in Meru town are holding a suspect who is helping them unravel the murder of a woman and the serious injury of her friend. The man was arrested after attacks last Friday in an apartment at Makutano area. Police said he lived in a neighbouring apartment, on the same floor as the murdered person. The woman who was killed was in her twenties. She was an employee of a government agency who had recently been posted to Meru town. Last Friday, a man entered her house at around 6 pm, in what neighbours described as usual, but turned against her and her friend. “He forced them to give out their M-Pesa and bank account PIN numbers and using accomplices, withdrew money from the accounts. After exhausting the maximum account float for Friday, he waited until past midnight and made more withdrawals,” said a police officer in the probe team. The attacker then terrorised the victims for hours before stabbing the resident to death. The woman's friend locked herself in the kitchen but the man broke in and injured her, leaving her for dead. He is said to have escaped when he realised police had reached the scene. Police are depending on the recovery of the injured woman, who is fighting for her life at a hospital in Nairobi; she will give them the full account of the incident that last at least six hours. Imenti North OCPD Peter Kimani said the murderer was still at large but that the suspect had given them crucial leads. “We have also applied to obtain bank and statements from mobile service providers and the banks to establish the accounts to which the money was transferred,” Mr Kimani said. He added that they will establish whether this was a case of love gone sour. The body was taken to Meru Hospital mortuary.
