Murang’a County Assembly has suspended two MCAs for assaulting the Majority Whip Samson Wamwea and insulting the Majority Leader in separate incidents. Joyce Wambui Njoki was suspended for two months for slapping and insulting Mr Wamwea last month at Kasarani Sports View Hotel in Nairobi where they had gone for official duty. After the incident, which forced the hotel management to eject the two from the hotel, Mr Wamwea went to Kasarani Police Station where he recorded a statement. Mr Wamwea later reported Ms Njoki to Powers and Privileges Committee in the Assembly. “She found me signing the attendance register and started insulting me alongside the leader of the majority and the speaker calling us goons of the governor. “When she saw that I was not responding, she proceeded to slap me in my face,” Mr Wamwea said in a report to the committee. But Ms Njoki when testifying before the committee denied attacking Mr Wamwea. She said the Mr Wamwea gravely insulted her and she pushed him causing commotion at the hotel. After the report was tabled in the Assembly, members agreed to discipline Ms Njoki. On the other hand, nominated MCA Catherine Wanjiku was suspended for three months for hurling insults at the majority leader on August 2 after she stormed his office. However Ms Wanjiku told the Assembly that the accusations by the majority leader were malicious, adding that he was reacting after she allegedly turned down his sexual advances. “Since I joined the Assembly, he has been making sexual advances at me and when I objected he vowed to punish me,” she told Assembly. The two MCAs will not be sitting for any committee or the Assembly sessions and will not be receiving allowances for the period they have been suspended. Members of the Murang’a County Assembly has been turning physical whenever they have disagreements both in the House and outside. Earlier this year, seven MCAs were charged in court for storming majority leader’s office with an aim of ejecting him.
