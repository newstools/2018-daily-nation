Michael Olunga's transfer to Japan top tier club Kashiwa Reysol has been confirmed. As exclusively revealed by Nation Sport earlier this week, the 24-year-old has been acquired by the J-League side on a three-year contract from Chinese club Guizhou Zhicheng. “New Roads, New Rivers, New Chapter. Beginning of another unfolded history,” Olunga wrote on his Instagram page in his first message since becoming a Reysol player. Media reports suggest the player will now pocket Sh15 million as monthly salary at his new workstation, translating to a Sh5 million increase. However, the Harambee Stars striker’s overall value in the transfer market has decreased by Sh100 million after this move. J-League side Reysol have paid about Sh300 million to top-tier Chinese side Guizou Zhicheng in exchange for Olunga’s services. This represents a Sh100-million loss compared to the Sh400 million Ghuizou paid Sweden side IF Djurgardens to acquire Olunga in mid 2016. Also, Olunga becomes the first Kenyan footballer to play professionally in Japan. The left-footed attacker is also the latest big-name player to move to Japan, following in the footsteps of European stars Andreas Iniesta, Lukas Podolski and Fernando Torres. The former Gor Mahia star has been linked with moves to English sides Everton, Huddersfield and Hull City in the past few weeks. Reysol finished fourth in the 18-team J-League last season, and the team’s technical bench, led by coach Takahiro Shimotaira, will be hoping Olunga’s addition fires them towards a third league title in the club’s history.
