More local football sides are in line to benefit from the second phase of the SportPesa funded ‘Kits For Africa’ initiative set to commence in the United Kingdom this weekend. According to a statement released by the gaming firm Friday, fans of English Premier League sides Everton and Southampton alongside those of Championship club Hull City will join players and members of the public in donating their old kits to underprivileged grassroots teams across Africa. This initiative, now in its second phase, will commence at Goodison Park Saturday evening when Everton take on Southampton in a league match. Collection bins have been sign-posted around the stadium for fans kits donations. This campaign was launched two years ago and has so far been a huge success, with almost 30,000 kits collected last season alone and passed onto football loving communities in Africa. Nairobi-based Liberty FC, Mashimoni, Gyff FC, Laini saba, Mustach Mashimoni, Kajulu FC, Katwekera, River Plate FC, Silanga, Shofco U20 FC, Gatwekera FC are some of the grassroots teams which have benefitted from this initiative. This campaign is part of a commitment from SportPesa to help build and develop grassroots football in the countries it operates in.
