Health officials who divert drugs from county hospitals to private chemists will be sacked and prosecuted, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has warned. The warning comes after Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) resumed supply of drugs to the county after a long standoff occasioned by debt owed to the agency. On Thursday, Kemsa agreed to supply the first batch of drugs worth Sh146m to Nairobi County after Governor Sonko struck a deal with the agency. The state corporation is currently owed Sh234m. “Any county officer who will steal or divert drugs will be sacked and be prosecuted,” said Mr Sonko. SUPPLY MEDICINE Kemsa Chief Executive Officer Dr Jonah Manjari said that after a successful meeting with Governor Sonko, the agency will supply medicine to the county. “We had fruitful deliberations with the Governor, we are confident that we will deliver quality and affordable healthcare to all Kenyans,” said Dr Manjari after Kemsa released medical supplies to Nairobi County at Embakasi supply chain centre. Dr Manjari acknowledged that Kemsa last supplied Nairobi County with drugs in February 2017. “We have been pursuing for months and we wish to commend the efforts of Governor Sonko in making sure that Nairobi residents receive the best healthcare possible and at affordable rates,” he said. DISTRIBUTION OF DRUGS Nairobi County acting Health Executive Veska Kagongo, who represented the governor at the function, welcomed the decision by Kemsa to resume supply of drugs to county hospitals. “We are now happy that Kemsa has started supplying us with drugs after nearly more than 12 months. We promise to ensure the drugs are well utilised by our county hospitals,” said Ms Kagongo at KEMSA offices. The acting Health executive, who also doubles up as devolution executive, later oversaw the distribution of the drugs to hospitals in Nairobi County.
