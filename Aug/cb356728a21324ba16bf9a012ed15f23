A man accused of assaulting his pregnant wife on Friday has denied the charge before an Eldoret court. Mr Naftali Shamo Luzuli, who was charged with causing Ms Valarie Masibo facial, ear and dental injuries, pleaded with Eldoret Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa to allow him to settle the matter out of court. “I have talked with my wife and she is willing that we settle this matter amicably out of court,” he told Mr Obulutsa. But the magistrate turned down his plea and released him on Sh300,000 bond with a surety of an equal amount. The case will be heard on August 20. IN DANGER The prosecution opposed the suspect’s release, saying his life could be in danger after Ms Masibo’s photos were widely shared on social media. “Your honour, this incident has caused a public uproar and if he is released on cash bail we are not sure about his coming back to court. We are also not sure about his safety since the public threatened to lynch him when he was being taken to Yamumbi Police Station,” said Mrs M.C Busienei, the prosecution counsel. BUY SUPPER Meanwhile, Ms Masibo is still undergoing treatment at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) as an outpatient. According to Ms Masibo’s aunt, Ms Rosemary Kusimba, the couple has been having frequent fights. Neighbours also claimed that Mr Luzuli had hit Ms Masibo before when they argued. Then, on Friday last week, he reportedly gave her Sh500 to buy food and prepare it for supper but the meal was not ready when he arrived home. Annoyed, he beat her viciously before neighbours came to her rescue.   Suspect to be charged when victim’s medical report is ready.
