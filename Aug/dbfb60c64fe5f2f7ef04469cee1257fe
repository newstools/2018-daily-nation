Police have impounded a consignment of illegal sugar in Wajir County. County Commissioner Loyford Kibaara said two lorries carrying 400 bags of sugar were impounded in Habaswein on Friday. "Earlier today we managed to impound two lorries which were transporting contraband sugar in Habaswein," he said. Mr Kibaara said the drivers, Hassan Osman Shekow and Mohamed Mahad Fara, are in police custody awaiting trial. The seizure comes two days after three lorries carrying 36 tons of illegal sugar were impounded in Qahira, several kilometres from Wajir Town. CRACKDOWN The drivers have since been charged at Wajir Law Courts while the owners of the vehicles were given 14 days to explain why their lorries should not be confiscated by the government. Mr Kibaara vowed to continue the crackdown on illegal goods. The county is among the main transit routes used by smugglers. Sugar, cooking oil and milk are the mains goods smuggled into the country from Somalia.   Fresh revelations of a thriving illegal cross-border trade brings a new twist to saga.
