The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on Wednesday said it agreed with the EACC that there is enough evidence to charge the suspects. "The DPP has independently reviewed the file and material submitted to him and is satisfied that the persons named are criminally culpable jointly and severally," the DPP communicated Wednesday evening. SUSPECTS Also to be charged alongside Dr Kidero are Lilian Wanjiru (former county secretary), Jimmy Mutuku (Former CFO), Gregory Mwakanongo (former Finance executive) and Stephen Ogago (Former H/O County Treasury).

Allegations include abuse of office, money laundering and bribery.
