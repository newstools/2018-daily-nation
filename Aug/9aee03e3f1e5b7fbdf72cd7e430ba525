Kenya Ports Authority teams bounce back to defend their unbeaten record in this year’s men and women’s Kenya Basketball Federation Premier League when they host Nairobi-based opponents in opening second leg matches at KPA Makande Gymnasium in Mombasa on Saturday. KPA’s women will set the ball rolling against struggling Footprints at 2pm before their male counterparts lock horns with high-riding Umoja from 4pm. Earlier at the same venue, Coastal Kings, who were promoted to the men’s Division One league for the first time this year, will also host Nairobi-based experienced Kenya Airports Authority at 12pm. KPA teams, that had taken a break to feature in the Kecoso Games in Kakamega, are the only unbeaten sides in this year’s six-month-old national league which has attracted 58 clubs competing in five different categories. Umoja rocked league leaders Blades 62-53 last weekend and their focused coach Martin Okwako is already motivated to break KPA’s six-month unbeaten record. Umoja have been consistently grabbing winning baskets from forwards Douglas Momanyi, Mike Juma and Melvin Freeman, who cannot be underrated by hosts KPA. KPA men’s team coach Sammy Kiki denied Umoja maximum two points in first leg but this time round, key forwards Victor Odendo, Martin Kitonga, Dickson Arani and Evans Leting must come up with a different approach against slippery Umoja. KPA women, under head coach Anthony Ojukwu, will no doubt start as favorites to win against weak Footprints, who have only won two matches and lost 10. Footprints were clobbered 45-36 by Masaku Sparks before Equity Bank punished them 82-49 last weekend.
