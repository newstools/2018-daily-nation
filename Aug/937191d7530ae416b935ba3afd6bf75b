American fast food franchise Burger King is seeking to expand its footprint in the Kenyan market with the opening of its fourth outlet at the Thika Road Mall (TRM). The franchise already has a presence at the city’s NextGen, The Hub, and Two Rivers malls. The restaurant is independently owned and operated through a franchise agreement with NAS Airport Services Limited, a subsidiary of Servair, the third-largest airline catering and logistics business globally and the category’s leader on the African continent. The TRM outlet adds to the chain’s presence in Africa, which currently has locations in Egypt, Morocco, South Africa, and Ivory Coast. Restaurant chains, retailers and consumer-goods companies are expanding in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of middle-class households has tripled.
