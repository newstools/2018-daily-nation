Police in Rongo have launched investigations after a woman burnt down her house in South Kanyajuok killing one of her children and injuring two others. Confirming the incident, Rongo OCPD Peter Kirui said the woman, 35, locked herself in the house with the three children and then set it on fire. Mr Kirui said the suspect Ms Emily Odhiambo, a wife of the local assistant chief David Onyango, had quarrelled with her husband when she decided to burn herself together with the children aged, 3, 8 and 10 years. The incident occurred on Friday at about 5pm. The husband, who is reported to have been away attending to his administrative duties, was too shocked to speak to the press. The couple is said to have had long-standing domestic feuds that have led to frequent separations. "The two have been fighting frequently and the woman had been telling people that she will do something nasty to punish the husband for planning to marry a second wife. It is very unfortunate that she has included her innocent children in the heinous punishment," said a relative, who requested anonymity. According to the police boss, neighbours helped put out the fire but the three-year-old child succumbed to serious burns while undergoing treatment at the Migori County Referral Hospital. The woman and the two surviving children are nursing their injuries at the same hospital. Nurses told the Nation one of the children is in critical condition.
