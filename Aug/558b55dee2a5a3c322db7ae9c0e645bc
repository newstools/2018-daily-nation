Tusker coach Robert Matano has warned his charges against complacency when they take on Kakamega Homeboyz in their SportPesa Premier League match this weekend.Matano, who led his charges to a morale-boosting 2-1 win over bogey side Sofapaka in their rescheduled league match on Monday morning at Ruaraka, said he is wary of the threat posed by Homeboyz in Kakamega. "Homeboyz is one of the strong teams like us. Therefore, we have to be composed and take our chances, because everything is possible,” the former AFC Leopards coach told Nation Sport on Wednesday after leading his charges in a two-hour workout at Ruaraka. However, Matano raised concerns over the standards of officiating in the top flight league citing examples from their win over Sofapaka where the brewers escaped with only their third win over Batoto ba Mungu in 22 matches. “Referees are the custodians of the law and they should stick to the rules and regulations and act like professionals. That’s what there are trained to do, which makes matches enjoyable because every team competes to play in a match where there's fair play.” Tusker, beaten 2-0 in the opening leg fixture by Homeboyz at their Ruaraka backyard, will be seeking revenge against the Paul Nkata-led side. Nkata led the brewers to the domestic Cup and league double in 2016 – the last time Tusker won a silverware.
