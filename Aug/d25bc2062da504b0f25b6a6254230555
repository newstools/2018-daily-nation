Nairobi edged out Nakuru 2-1 to win the football title in a chaos-marred final on the third day of the Water Companies Sports Organizations Games in Nyeri Thursday. Police were forced to intervene and break up fighting fans after a protest ensued following a foul by Nairobi’s Moses Shisia on Nakuru goalkeeper Emmanuel Asuba at the Dedan Kimathi University. Referee Jack Gitonga was forced to red card Shisia with Nakuru the first to score in the 25th minute through striker Eliud Rotich. Nairobi drew level in the 75th minute through Kelvin Were with Shisia heading home the winner in the 78th before the fracas. Nairobi water successfully recaptured the volleyball after they floored Nzoia in a thrilling final 3-0 (26-24, 25-14, 25-17). Nairobi coach Peter Miano attributed the victory to determination and dedication by the players. “It has been a tough journey because the teams have prepared well. We are happy to retain the title,” said Miano. The games enter the closing weekend Friday with athletics action at Kabiruini Showground.
