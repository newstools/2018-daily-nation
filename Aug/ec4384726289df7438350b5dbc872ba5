Powerful running winger William Ambaka scored a brace of tries but it was not enough as Kenya Simbas went down 53-28 to Namibia at Hage Geingob Rugby Stadium, Windhoek on Saturday in the deciding battle for the one automatic African slot for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Namibia, who also got to retain the Rugby Africa Gold Cup now join automatic qualifiers South Africa for the Rugby World Cup set for Japan next year. However, Kenya Simbas have a second chance to qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup at the Repechage tournament due in November in France after they finished second in the Africa qualifier. Namibia claimed their fifth consecutive Golf Cup after they consolidate their top spot to 25 points with their fifth consecutive bonus point victory. Kenya, who finished second in the qualifier with 17 points, will now battle Canada, Hong Kong and Germany at the Repechage qualifying tournament. While Ambaka plundered a brace, substitutes forward Malcom Onsando and back Mohammed Omollo scored a try each with inside centre Darwin Mukidza adding all the extras. Kicker Cliven Loubser touched down three of Namibiaâ€™s six tries in addition to four conversions and two penalties to catapult his team to their sixth Rugby World Cup finals. Hooker Loius van der Westhuizen scored a brace while full-back Chrysander Botha one. Uganda finished third in the championship despite losing to Zimbabwe 38-18 in Kampala yesterday while Morocco and Tunisia were to face-off in a relegation battle in Tunis. Kenya Simbas looked jittery in their approach, losing most of their ball possession in line-out and the rucks what with Namibia cashing on their weakness in set-pieces to pile in tries.
