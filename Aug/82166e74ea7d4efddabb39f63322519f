Nairobi County government has unearthed an illegal alcohol and drugs peddling ring in the capital city. Nairobi City County Alcoholic Drinks Control and Licensing Board (NCCADCLB) on Friday found a group of people living with disabilities with hundreds of sachets of contraband alcoholic drinks believed to have been smuggled into the country from a neighbouring country. Following a tip-off, the county officers discovered alcohol concealed as candy and sweets. The officers confiscated the contraband alcohol but set free the suspects for fear of criticism from the public. SELLING SWEETS NCCADCLB chairperson Kennedy Odhiambo fears that many people living with disabilities could be involved in the illegal trade in the city. He said that many people, who pretend to be selling sweets in different streets of the capital city, could be peddling contraband alcohol and drugs. He said many people take advantage of the physically challenged individuals to engage them in the illicit trade. ILLEGAL ALCOHOL Mr Odhiambo has said that he will ensure that the board gets rid of all illegal alcohol and drugs. “It is unfortunate that physically challenged people are used to distribute alcohol and drugs concealed as sweets to their clients. “We are following useful leads and the perpetrators must be warned that their days of harming residents of this city, especially the youth, are over,” added Mr Odhiambo.
