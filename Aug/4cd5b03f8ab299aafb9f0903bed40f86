Police in Migori have seized bhang weighing 230 kilogrammes and which is estimated to worth Sh2.3 million. The bhang haul was seized Thursday evening in Maro along the border of Migori and Kisii counties. The illegal consignment, which was packed in black polythene bags and was being ferried in a Toyota Probox car registration KCN 656U, was seized by officers from the Quick Response Unit after hours of pursuit along the Migori-Kisii highway. Migori County Commissioner Joseph Rotich said police managed to intercept the car at Maro as the suspect was trying to escape to Kisii County. DRIVER ESCAPES “The driver of the vehicle that was ferrying the bhang managed to escape abandoning the vehicle on the road when the police waylaid him,” said Mr Rotich, adding that the haul was smuggled from Tanzania and was destined for Nairobi. The county commissioner said the fight against narcotics in the county is still on and that they are working with officers from the neighbouring counties and in Tanzania to stop the illegal business. HELP FIGHT NARCOTICS His sentiments were echoed by Migori County Police Commandeer Joseph Nthenge and the county AP Commander Julius Amariko who asked members of the public to continue helping the police in the fight against narcotics. “Our offices are on alert all the time and no illegal drug that will pass through Migori without being intercepted once sported,” Amariko said. Mr Nthenge said police will not relent in the fight against narcotics in Migori County, adding that they are coming up with better strategies. "The war on narcotics in this county will continue. We are telling those who engage in this dirty business to stop as we shall soon catch up with them," said Mr Nthenge. The police officers further urged locals to support the war on drugs by volunteering vital information concerning suspected drug peddlers. "We continue to urge members of the public to work closely with us to end this menace once and for all," added Mr Rotich.
