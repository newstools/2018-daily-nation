Demolitions to clear up structures built on riparian land in Nairobi continued on Tuesday. Residential houses built on Ring Road Kileleshwa next to the Shell petrol station that was demolished on Monday were targeted on day two of the exercised conducted by a multi-agency team. Officials from the National Environment Management Authority, the National Youth Service and the Nairobi County oversaw the exercise. The owners of the homes that were affected on Monday who had replaced their perimeter walls were shocked when the temporary iron sheets they had put up were also pulled down. Residents are still upset over the manner in which the operation has been carried out. The owner of Sunflower Apartments, Rosemary, said residents should have been informed about the demolitions. "If they had come and told us nicely that we needed to clear land up to a certain level, we would have cooperated," Ms Rosemary said.   National environment watchdog targets properties on wetlands.
