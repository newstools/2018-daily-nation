Nairobi County has suspended the construction of AVIC Tower over claims that it is partly built on public land. Governor Mike Sonko's press director Elkana Jacob on Thursday said 15 people have also been arrested in connection with the construction. The individuals include 10 Chinese nationals. "We have suspended the construction and arrested over 15 people who include 10 Chinese nationals," a statement from Mr Jacob says. Grace Lee, Leo Lu, Micael Chen, Javis Wu and Len Li were arraigned at City Hall magistrate court and charged with constructing the building without approved plans, contrary to Section 30(2) of the Physical Planning Act. They were however released on cash bails of Sh100,000 each. The case that will be mentioned on September 4. The swoop comes hot in the heels of arrests of 14 people on Wednesday - including Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu's wife Susan Ndung'u - over construction of a building in the city centre without requisite approvals. They were granted cash bails and the case is set for mention on September 6.   The building is said to have encroached a road reserve.
