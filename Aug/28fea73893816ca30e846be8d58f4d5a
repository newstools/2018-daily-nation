A man from Kwang’ombe village in Tharaka-Nithi County has been murdered, allegedly by his relatives, and his body buried in a grave that had been dug for his cousin who died last week. Mr Nyaga Ituranthi, a father of six, was reportedly killed following a land dispute. One of the man’s daughters told journalists that she heard screams of someone in pain and upon rushing to the direction the voices were coming from, she saw her father being beaten by his relatives with his hands tied together. “I tried to plead with them to stop beating my father but they continued beating him with rods and cutting him with panga,” said the sobbing daughter. AXE ATTACK She added that one of the assailant attacked her father with an axe at the back of his head and he collapsed. “I saw my dad lie unconsciously on the ground. I decided to take his shoes that had fallen off but one of them threatened to kill me too,” she said adding that she had to run for her dear life. She said the attackers went on and buried her father’s body in a grave that had been dug for his cousin who died a week ago. Mwanyani Chief Simon Mucee Mbutu and police officers from Marimanti station later visited the home and removed the body and took it to Chuka County Referral Hospital mortuary to await post-mortem. The chief told journalists that the body had deep cuts in the stomach and head and was tied on both hand and legs. “The attackers who went into hiding after committing the crime had buried the deceased while tied on both legs and hands,” Mucee said. Police have launched investigations into the matter to establish what led to the inhuman act.
