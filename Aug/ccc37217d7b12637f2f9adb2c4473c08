Hi Brenda, My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year, but I have lost interest in him. I have been thinking of breaking up with him but I don’t know how. I don’t want to waste his time because I know we won’t go far. How do I break up with him without hurting him? You say you don't want to waste his time, but you're already doing just that. Just break up with the dude already. You were bold enough to get into a relationship, be bold enough to get out of one too. Write a letter. Send an email. Make a call. Take out a sign in the paper. Text. Any way you do so will hurt him regardless, especially because your reason seems weak. If you could bother to value your history, put on your big girl pants, meet him in person and make a clean break. Anything short of that is disrespectful but at this point, if I was on the receiving end of your disinterest, I'd much rather know than have you string me along while I think we're going somewhere. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
