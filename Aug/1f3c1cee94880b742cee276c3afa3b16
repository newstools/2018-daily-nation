Ronald Odhiambo Kidero, the son of former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero, has denied storing substandard petroleum products which do not meet mandatory standards as set by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. Appearing Friday before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi, Mr Kidero pleaded not guilty and was freed on Sh100,000 cash bail. He is accused of storing two tanks of diesel and gasoline which were substandard. "On August 3, at Ridgeways Shell petrol station, along Kiambu Road in Nairobi, the accused, jointly with others not before court, were found to have stored the said petroleum products," the prosecution told the court. The storage tanks contained 14,000 and 28,000 litres of petrol and motor vehicle gasoline respectively. VIVO The prosecution wanted directors of Vivo Kenya ordered to report to DCI headquarters over the supply of adulterated petroleum products. But the magistrate ruled that the company had not been mentioned in the charge sheet and therefore dismissed the request. Lawyers representing Vivo Kenya asked the prosecution to provide them with the investigation report that led to the arrest, and the recommendation that the accused be charged in court. The company said they get all their products from the Kenya Pipeline Company, and therefore wants to pursue the matter with the Energy Regulatory Commission. The prosecution said it is willing to share its reports with the defence and any other party interested in the matter. The case will be heard on September 4 but will be mentioned on August 23 for pre-trial conference.
