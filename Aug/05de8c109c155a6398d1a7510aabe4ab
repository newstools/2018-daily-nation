Kenya once again came up short in the boys’ volleyball competition as home side St Joseph overcame Malava Boys 3-2 in Sunday’s final on the last day of the Brookside East Africa Secondary School Games. It was heartbreak for the Kenyan boys, who battled hard in the thrilling five-set final, before going down 16-25, 25-21, 23-25, 25-15, 10-15 at the MIPC grounds. The result saw Rwanda successfully retain the title following Rusumo High’s win against home side Luyanzi College in Gulu last year. Malava, who were the last Kenyan side to win the title in 2016 in Eldoret, were looking for their seventh crown but were undone by an impressive St Joseph backed by a huge home support. It looked like the Kenyans had finally found the formula to go on and win the match after winning the fourth set to bring the game to 2-2. However, the Rwandans would compose themselves to lead 7-5 before the teams switched sides. They led 12-10 when a technical time out was called before comfortably closing out the contest. “We gave our all in this match. The lads, they fought hard,” said Malava coach Shadrack Tovoko.   St Anthony’s cemented their place as the most successful boys’ team in the region.
