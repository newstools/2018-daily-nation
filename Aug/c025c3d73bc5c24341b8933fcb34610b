Kenyaâ€™s crime-busting directorate is hunting for nine suspects linked to theft and sale of Kenya Power properties. The directorate of criminal investigations (DCI) on Friday said the suspects were behind the racket that has been fraudulently acquiring of the electricity distributor. The suspects are Ms Catherine Wanjiko Njuguna, Ms Christine Nyawara, Mr Edwin Machaira Ngamini all of Mallous Enterprises, and Mr John Waweru of Kazimix Enterprises. Others are Mr Jason Morara, Mr James Ongechi, Mr Jeremiah Onduko all of Jake Building and Construction Limited, Mr Stephen Njoroge Maina of Wachema Investments Limited and Ms Linet Njeri of Pestus Investments Limited. A Nairobi court has issued warrants of arrest against the suspects and the George-Kinoti-led directorate wants the pubic to help bring them to book. Any person with information on the suspects, DCI said in a Twitter post, should report to Milimani Anti-Corruption Court No.1 in Nairobi or at the DCI Kenya offices. The Kinoti team, however, did not reveal details of the properties the suspects are accused of acquiring. Last month, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji ordered for the arrest of several Kenya power staff and top managers over procurement of defective transformers and irregular prequalification of 525 firms for labour and transport contracts. The case is currently before court.   Insiders attribute high bills to contracting of thermal generators who are paid capacity charges even when they supply nothing.
