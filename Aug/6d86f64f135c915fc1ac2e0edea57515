The governmentâ€™s decision to allow fish imports from China has continued to elicit varied reactions from Kenyans. An issue that has stuck out like a sore thumb in the raging debate is what this portends for the local fishing industry, which, statistics show, supports no less than 100,000 Kenyans directly and nearly 800,000 indirectly. The concern is that increased Chinese fish imports will dilute the market for the Kenyan fishermen and deny them and their families a dependable source of income. The second is the question of the quality of the imports and whether adequate measures have been put in place to ensure the Chinese fish is devoid of contamination that can put the lives of Kenyan consumers at risk. The State has strenuously countered these concerns with the twin assurance that the fish is safe and the imports were necessitated by a shortfall in harvests locally. FISH FARMING Official statistics indicate that the country rakes in 130,000 tonnes of fish annually and imports some 37,000 tonnes to meet the shortfall. The fisheries sector plays an important role in the national economy with meaningful contribution to the Gross Domestic Product. In an apparent appreciation of this, the government has in recent years provided funds to Kenyans eager to venture into fish farming, both to boost production of the commodity and to create employment. UNSCRUPULOUS INDIVIDUALS These are the salient factors that must now be considered. The danger, as has been witnessed in other sectors, including sugar, is that if the imports are not strictly monitored, unscrupulous individuals will take advantage of the situation to bring in huge consignments of fish of questionable quality. This could cripple the local fishing industry, with severe socio-economic ramifications. The government must ensure the local fishing industry and the livelihoods of nearly a million people who depend on it are secured.
