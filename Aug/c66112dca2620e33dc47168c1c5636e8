Kenya Simbas’ 53-28 loss to Namibia on Saturday in their 2019 Rugby World Cup Africa qualifier, is costly. The result saw Namibia claim the continent’s sole slot at stake to next year’s Rugby World Cup finals in Japan, joining automatic qualifiers South Africa, and also retain the Rugby Africa Gold Cup. However, Kenya can make a second and last stab at Japan — at the much tougher Repechage tournament in November in France, where they will meet Canada, Germany and Hong Kong. The journey to Japan 2019 was bound to be tough. There’s no shame in losing to Namibia, most of whose players ply their trade in rugby powerhouse South Africa. But even though a step from Japan, it was a clear that Kenya’s 15s rugby standards are still low. INVESTMENT The truth is that the Simbas might fail to qualify for Japan. Kenya Rugby Union must, therefore, concentrate on rebuilding the team for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. When Kenya almost qualified for the 2014 Rugby World Cup, beating the likes of Namibia, they had had quality build-up matches, the highlight being participation in the 2015 Vodacom Cup in South Africa. There were none this time round. The Simbas will require quality matches to challenge Namibia, their main rivals, while noting that Zimbabwe are on the rise. Unlike predecessor Jerome Paarwater, who had been with the team for a long time, coach Ian Snook only took over in April. Just raising the fitness levels in the team has taken most of the time. The KRU should put in place the right mechanism to identify talent early enough. Kenya needs a centre of excellence and high-performance rugby centre, particularly in the western region, where most of the rugby players are drawn from. It will also need to invest in good salaries, allowances and match bonuses for players, as well as sponsorship, as preparing a 15s team is quite expensive.
