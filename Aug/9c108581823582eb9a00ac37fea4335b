Wildlife occupies a special space in Kenya’s tourism industry and no effort should be spared to protect the animals. Game safaris are a fascination with foreign tourists and rake in crucial foreign exchange. Reports of a proposal to allow game hunting are appalling. It goes against what Kenyans has fought over the decades. Sport hunting thrived in the 1970s but was stopped as it endangered the country’s famed game. Matters became worse in the 1980s, when poachers entered the scene and raided the animal sanctuaries with wanton abandon. POACHERS That worsening situation compelled the government to create the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to manage the game resources and take away that responsibility from a department under the then-Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. It took strong will, determination and serious commitment by KWS to fight the poachers and stabilise the wildlife numbers. The events of that era are still clear in our minds and we would never want to get back to that morass. Evidence demonstrates that Kenya’s game population is declining pretty fast and fighting poaching is a veritable challenge. HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT Environmental factors characterised by diminishing forest cover, coupled with the growing human population that precipitates frequent human-wildlife conflict over settlement space, have worsened the situation. Faced with this grave situation, it would be ill-advised to allow a return to game hunting, either for the trophies or bush meat. That will deal a terrible blow to wildlife conservation. Some neighbouring countries and in southern Africa allow game hunting and it has worked for them to attract more tourists. But southern Africa, for example, has high wild animal numbers. Whatever the motivation, the new proposal cannot be justified.
