Nairobi County will host the inaugural County Assembly Sports and Cultural Festival which is set to kick off later this month. This will be a new sporting event among the 47 county assemblies in the country after breaking away from the original body, Kicosca (Kenya Inter-County Sports Association), which brought together both the executive and the assemblies. This follows the formation of a new inter-assembly’s games body known as County Assembly Sports Association (Casa) coming after the assemblies officially severed ranks with Kicosca. Nairobi Assembly minority whip Peter Imwatok, who is also the interim chair of Casa, said that the new body will now organise the weeklong event for the 47 assemblies from August 26. He said the event will have 17 disciplines which include football, netball, athletics, volleyball and Ajua among others. Over 2,000 participants are expected to attend the games which will be hosted at KCAA University, Stima Plaza grounds, University of Nairobi, Camp Toyoyo, with the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani being the main venue. “We have set aside a budget of Sh22 million raised through the more than 30 sponsors of the games, and County Assemblies Forum (Caf),” said Imwatok at City Hall on Thursday.
