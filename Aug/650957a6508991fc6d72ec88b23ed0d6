For urban counties such as Nairobi, parking is a potential source of revenue that is just poorly managed. It is, therefore, hardly surprising to learn that the city county loses more than Sh2 million daily in revenue because of laxity and collusion between parking attendants and some motorists. One of the biggest challenges is the acute shortage of parking spaces, especially in the city centre. This is what discourages many motorists who would comfortably buy season tickets. It simply does not make sense to pay in advance and then fail to get parking space. STORIED PARKING The solution is to invest in some storied parking silos or create special parking zones with improved security and many motorists will only be too willing to pay for it. The second challenge is charging a flat daily parking fee of Sh300, which even people who have brief engagements that will only take a few minutes must pay. Nairobi had metered bays that worked well but were left to run into disuse, with some being vandalised. Perhaps the county should explore the possibility of re-installing metered bays or allow motorists to pay for a specific period of time. The mismanagement of parking has created gangs of goons who extort money from motorists that does not reach the county’s coffers. IMPROVE COMPLIANCE According to the company contracted to digitise the city county’s revenue collection, if well-managed, it’s possible to collect much more from parking than the average Sh2.5 million it fetches daily. With compliance at only 43 per cent, the county is letting ready revenue slip through its fingers. To improve compliance, the city county must invest some capital and human resource to enable it to streamline the parking service. Asking motorists to pay more without guaranteeing the safety of their motor vehicles is callous business, to say the least.
