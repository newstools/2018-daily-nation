Two Nakuru ward representatives who engaged in a fist fight in the assembly's cafeteria have been suspended for 90 days. Ms Joyce Anyiso and Ms Jackline Wangeci Manyara, both Jubilee Party nominated MCAs, argued and exchanged obscenities before the scuffle. They were separated by Assembly orderlies and other MCAs. At the same time, in a communication to the Assembly on Wednesday evening, the Power and Privileges committee suspended four other nominated MCAs from the party and one elected MCA for gross misconduct. TRADED INSULTS While reading the riot act, Speaker Joel Maina Kairu said the MCAs put the assembly's image into question by engaging in fights and insults. Mr Douglas Ayabei (Mariashoni MCA) and Ms Ann Kimani (nominated) traded insults during a Jubilee consultative meeting at the branch headquarters in Milimani Estate on July 5. The two were ordered to apologise to the assembly and the party. Mr Ayabei was subsequently suspended from plenary and committee meetings for two weeks while Ms Kimani will stay away for three weeks. CHAPTER SIX In a second incident, nominated MCAs Elizabeth Gichuki and Catherine Kamau were accused of gross misconduct on July 29 at the Great Rift Valley Lodge before the executive and colleagues. Ms Kamau is accused of insulting Ms Gichuki causing a nuisance. She was suspended for three weeks. “Ms Kamau violated the laws and Chapter Six of Leadership and Integrity as enshrined in the Constitution,” said the Speaker. In the third incident, Ms Gichuki and nominated MCA Susan Njuguna, on July 5 at the cafeteria, traded insults causing a scene at the premises.   Jubilee's top leadership be be apprised of the outcome.
