Murarandia Ward MCA David Ng’ang’a Kiiru is under investigations for allegedly assaulting a woman from Kairi in Kiharu Constituency, Murang’a County over the theft of beer glasses. It is alleged that the MCA descended on the complainant, Margret Wanjiku, with slaps, kicks and blows on August 1 at around 10:30pm outside her Ngogoyo Bar after she picked a quarrel with her customer over the theft of glasses. “I had followed one of my customers who had gotten away with my glass but after reaching where the MCA was he defended the man and started beating me. I had noted that my glasses had been missing one by one and that informed me to be cautious with my customers,” the woman told the Nation. She said she proceeded to Muriranjas District Hospital after sustaining swellings on her face, legs and thighs after the MCA allegedly beat her. DENIED CLAIMS But the MCA has denied the allegations, saying that he only prevented the woman from beating up the man whom she had accused of stealing beer glass. “The allegations are not true, I only prevented the woman and some other people from beating up the man she claimed had stolen the beer glass. I am surprised that I have now turned to be accused; in fact I gave the woman Sh500 for her to stop beating the suspect,” Mr Kiiru told the Nation. The MCA was arrested and detained at Kahuro Police Station and later released on Sh10,000 police bond.. The MCA was expected to take plea on Thursday but Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Sebastian Mutinda recalled the file for perusal. “The office of DPP has ordered the file for perusal and further directions. We shall determine when the suspect will be charged,” Mr Mutinda told the Nation.
