Two MPs from Garissa have asked the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to post more female teachers to girls only schools so as to enable them address their issues. Garissa Woman Rep Anab Subow and Ijara MP Sophia Abdinoor urged the government to employ more female teachers as part of affirmative action. Speaking Monday at Fafi Girls Secondary School in Fafi Constituency during the school's parents’ day, the two lawmakers said that for a long time, girls schools in the area have been disadvantaged because they lack enough female teachers compared to boys schools. In Garissa County, out of the 11 girls’ schools, only four have female headteachers. PERFORMANCE AFFECTED Mrs Abdinoor said the current number of female teachers in girls' schools in the region is very low, something she said is impacting negatively on the performance of the girls. She said that at a personal level, there are issues that girls can discuss freely with female teachers as opposed to their male counterparts. She said that very few girls’ schools in the region are led by headmistresses. "I am appealing to the Ministry of Education to seriously look into this matter because it is one of the biggest contributors to the poor performance among the girls," she said. She challenged Form Four leavers joining colleges to take up teaching as a profession, noting that they are the ones who will save the region from the current problem of insufficient teachers. The Garissa woman rep, on her part, said that for girls are more comfortable sharing their issues with female teachers.
