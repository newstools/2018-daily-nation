Deputy President William Ruto has accused journalists of spreading propaganda and misinforming Kenyans following reports of division in Jubilee. The DP said the Fourth Estate was only interested in causing trouble in the country. Using President Uhuru Kenyatta’s remark that newspapers are only good for wrapping meat, the DP asked worshippers at PCEA Rititi in Nyeri to ignore the media and focus on the government's Big Four agenda. “Hata Rais alisema kuwa gazeti ni ya kufunga nyama (Even the President said newspapers are for wrapping meat),” he said. He added: “Every time you read the newspapers, remember that they have work to do and most times they are spreading propaganda." BIG FOUR AGENDAIn an apparent reference to opposition Leader Raila Odinga, the DP also warned leaders who have expressed interest to work with the Jubilee government against sideshows, saying they should only be focused on achieving the Big Four agenda. “We do not have room to discuss who matters and who does not,” he said. The DP took issue with recent headlines in the newspapers over disunity in Jubilee and the growing rift between President Kenyatta’s lieutenants and those allied to him. TWO CAMPS Legislators who had accompanied the DP denied the existence of two camps in State House and Jubilee Party; one made up of powerful forces opposed to Mr Ruto’s presidential ambitions. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria said news of infighting in Jubilee was a creation of the media. Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga said the media should respect the DP and highlight some of his positive deeds. Senate Deputy Speaker Kithure Kindiki said the reports of disunity will not split Jubilee Party.   The DP says the Fourth Estate is only interested in causing trouble in the country.
