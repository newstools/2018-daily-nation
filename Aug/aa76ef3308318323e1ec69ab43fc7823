Google’s latest Android operating system (OS) is out! And as with all the previous Android versions, this latest one has been named after a dessert, the Android 9.0 Pie. According to Google, this OS’ greatest feature is its Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will make your phone even smarter by learning from you and adapting to your usage patterns. The AI embedded in this version packs features like adaptive battery, which learns the apps you use most and prioritizes your battery for them, as well as the adaptive brightness which we’ve already seen in previous Android versions. FAMILIAR Anyone accustomed to a stock Android will find it familiar, albeit slight aesthetic changes here and there. The navigation buttons at the bottom are now just two; the back key and a mid-positioned key that responds to gestures to switch between ‘home’ and the ‘recent’ tab, which now have a new look. Also new in this OS are a set of ‘digital wellbeing’ features which help users understand how they are spending time on their devices. With the increasing addiction to digital gadgets, this should be quite helpful. The OS is now available to Google Pixel users through an over-the-air (OTA) update. Devices participating in the Beta program from Sony Mobile, Xiaomi, HMD Global (Nokia devices), Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus and Essential, as well as all qualifying Android One devices, will also receive the update according to Google.    Messenger can be used by businesses to help people keep track of account information.
