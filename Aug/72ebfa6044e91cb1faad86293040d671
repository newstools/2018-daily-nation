Capital FM is appealing for help in tracing its photojournalist Francis Mbatha who has been missing for more than a week. The station says Mr Mbatha has not been seen since Monday August 6. “His phone signal was last traced in Mombasa and efforts to locate him have been futile,” reports the station. “This is an appeal from his family and Capital FM to anyone who sees him to call 020 2210020, 0724 257 065 or report to the nearest police station.”
