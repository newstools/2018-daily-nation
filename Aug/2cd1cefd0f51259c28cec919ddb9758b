Fuel prices a threat The airline says higher fuel prices present a threat to its margins in the short term. “Although reporting improved performance, fuel price volatility continues to be a major challenge for the airline,” KQ said in a statement. “The price per barrel has been on an upward trend since the beginning of this year closing at USD 74 as at June 30, 2018 representing an increase of 12 per cent in global fuel prices within the first half of the financial year.” READ: Jambojet hits 2.5 million passengers in four years READ: Court reverses KQ staff rehiring order READ: 7,000 book KQ flights to the US READ: Revival of Nigeria, Uganda airlines ups pressure on KQ
