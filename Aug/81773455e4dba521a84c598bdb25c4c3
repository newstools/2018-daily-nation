The Judiciary has dismissed as fake a letter shared on social media claiming that judges and magistrates are on a go-slow following budget cuts. Chief Registrar Anne Amadi on Thursday wrote to the Divisional Criminal Investigations Officer Samuel Kobina asking him to investigate the origin of the letter and "bring the culprits to book in the shortest possible time". Ms Amadi said this was not the first time someone was using a forged letterhead from the Judiciary and a forged signature of Chief Justice David Maraga. She had written to Ms Kobina on April 13. "In this request, we have forwarded another letter that is currently circulating on social media," the letter reads. The Judiciary said it has also written to the providers of various social media platforms with "a view to ending this menace once and for all". "The letter is fake and bears a forged signature of the Chief Justice. It is written on a letterhead that has clearly been created by the mischievous authors," Ms Amadi said. Ms Amadi said they have notified the Communications Authority of Kenya through the Computer Incident Response Team to address the issue.   Judges say budgetary cut has further compromised the welfare of the entire Judiciary.
