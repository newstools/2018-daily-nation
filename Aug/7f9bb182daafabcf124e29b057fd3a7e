The wife of Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, Susan Wangare, and 14 other people have been arrested in Nairobi. Mrs Waititu was arrested by Nairobi City County government officers on Wednesday for erecting an eight-storey building without the requisite approvals. The other suspects include owners of Jamii Bora building on Koinange Street in the capital's central business district and Delta Hotel. They were taken to cells at City Hall where they spent some hours before Governor Mike Sonko, a close ally of Mr Waititu, intervened and ordered her release.  More follows.
