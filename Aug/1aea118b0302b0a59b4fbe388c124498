Harnessing of the blue economy for development is expected to dominate this year’s Mombasa International Show, which starts on Wednesday. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to officially open the show on Thursday. However, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho will be chief guest on Wednesday. Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (Kemfri) public relations officer Jane Kiguta said the focus of this year’s fair year is President Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda - manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing and food security - and harnessing the blue economy. According to the World Bank, blue economy is the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health. “We intend to show how we use recycled plastics, sea weeds, crab farming and mangrove management through the various projects that we have started to protect sea animals,” Ms Kiguta said in an interview. The show chairperson Anisa Abdalla said 200 local and international exhibitors have confirmed participation in the fair that ends on Sunday. “Most of our exhibitors are already here and more have shown interest and are planning to come,” she said. The show’s theme is ‘Promoting Innovation and Technology in Agriculture and Trade’. The event will include fun activities for children, display of different agricultural products, latest innovations and technology, traditional and cultural activities. “We are urging parents to come with their children so that they can have fun and also learn a lot,” she said. She added: “We have partnered with various companies including the Mombasa Eye Clinic who will conduct free eye screening. We therefore encourage those with eye problems to come and get treated.” She assured show-goers of their security. “For the first time, we will have CCTV cameras all over the place to ensure the safety of everyone,” she said.
