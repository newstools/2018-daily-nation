Reports that more than 20 Kenyan universities are not actively engaged in research is a sad statement on the state of higher education in the country. A study by global market and social research company CPS International shows that more than 18 per cent of the institutions have less than 10 lecturers dedicated to research and that 35 per cent of them do not have research laboratories or incubation centres. This sorry situation is only made worse by the fact that the government runs a research endowment fund under the auspices of the National Research Foundation, which is mandated to finance and coordinate research and innovation for national development. This means the dearth of research is not entirely due to inadequate funding but rather a grave structural gap or systemic failure. KNOWLEDGE Universities have three missions — teaching, research and community service. They exist to create knowledge through research and innovation. They are meant to transform people’s well-being and their countries’ fortunes by bringing new ideas and skills to confront daily social and economic challenges. A university that does not have research at the heart of its operations is not worth the name. It is essential that the Commission for University of Education takes a keen interest in goings-on in the institutions. Most postgraduate courses place a high premium on research and new knowledge; which begs the question, how are universities without innovation centres allowed to operate? In a nutshell, such institutions are like referral hospitals without an operating theatre. It is heartening that some universities have remained true to their mandate by producing numerous publications and journals that make them measure up to the best. Survival and progress of the institutions depend on their investment on research and innovation.
