Police in Nakuru are searching for a suspect who fled after allegedly stabbing a man to death with a knife claiming he was having an affair with his wife. County police commander Hassan Barua said the police are in pursuit of the man who also stabbed another person as he fled the scene at Free Area in Nakuru. During the Saturday evening incident, the suspect is said to have drawn a knife and stabbed the first victim more than six times on the back and chest before he fled as residents watched in shock. “Police are investigating the incident and very soon the suspect who is well-known will be apprehended,” said Mr Barua. The suspect is said to have also stabbed another man on the neck as he fled from the scene. The second victim was taken to Nakuru Level Five Hospital where he is recuperating. A witness, Ms Revinah Wanjiku, said she saw the assailant who appeared drunk descending on the man he claimed was having an affair with his wife. “It happened so fast that suspect drew the knife from his trousers and used it to stab the deceased,” said Ms Wanjiku. Locals angered by the incident protested over the failure by the police to arrest the suspect and went searching for him on Sunday, claiming he was hiding in one of the houses near the incident. But the police intervened, persuading the locals to abandon the search which was causing tension in the area.
