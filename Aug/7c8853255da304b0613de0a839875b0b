The high court will next week deliver judgement on the appeal by slain Muslim cleric Aboud Rogo's widow Hania Sagar. She is challenging a 10-years jail term handed to her by a magistrate court in 2016. Mombasa High Court Judge Dorah Chepkwony on Thursday deferred the ruling to September 10. Ms Sagar was found guilty of failing to give information about terrorists who attacked a police station in Mombasa two years ago. In her appeal, she described the sentence by Senior Principal Magistrate Diana Mochache as “illegal, harsh and excessive". "The learned magistrate erred in law, convicting the appellant when the prosecution did not lead any evidence to prove the offence charged to the standard required in law,” she said in the appeal. COMPLICIT She further faulted the trial court for convicting her "by taking into account irrelevant and extraneous matters, assumptions, theories and speculative conclusions that were never backed by evidence". Ms Mochache said she was in constant communication with three slain suspected terrorists who attacked Central police station on September 11. The suspects - Tasnim Yakub, Ramla Abdirahman Hussein and Maimuna Abdirahman - were killed after a foiled attack at the police station.   Lawyer says Hania Sagar will appeal sentence within 14 days.
