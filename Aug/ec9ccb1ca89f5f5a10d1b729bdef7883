The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has asked police boss Joseph Boinnet to probe the irregular procurement of media services by the ICT ministry and the Government Advertising Agency. Mr Haji gave the directive following an editorial in the Daily Nation criticising the institutions for obtaining resources and not paying for them. The editorial slams the Jubilee government for crippling local business by not honouring contracts. "The act of government departments obtaining goods or services from Kenyans, including women, youth and persons with disabilities, and wilfully failing to pay for them, criminally falls short of the expectations of those legal provisions. "The Jubilee government is wallowing, not just in foreign debt, but also in the money it owes local businesses, which it has either crippled or is in the process of ruining," the editorial published on Tuesday says. DEBT Mr Haji directed Inspector General Boinnet to update him about the progress after every 21 days. "In light of the issues raised in the aforementioned editorial and in the public interest... you are hereby directed to cause speedy and thorough investigations into the issues raised therein," the letter reads. The editorial further indicates that the two institutions owe the media Sh2.5 billion, which is denting the government's image. It adds: "We appeal to the Director of Public Prosecutions to require the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to investigate the failure by the National Treasury to prudently provide resources for the settlement of genuine government debt to Kenyans who have supplied goods and services worth tens of billions of shillings to it and whose lives have now been destroyed or are in the process of being destroyed by this callous disregard for contracts."   Only third of Kenyans have access to the internet, meaning millions would be locked out.
