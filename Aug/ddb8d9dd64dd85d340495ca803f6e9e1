Hi, Is it possible to love someone because of his money? That’s what attracted me to a certain man before, but now I feel I have fallen in love with him. I don’t know how to tell whether it is genuine.  Money is a very real love, let's be honest. People who say nonsense like money can't buy you happiness are very clearly already with money and shopping in the wrong places. Certainly, money can't buy character, because money is like alcohol – it brings out something that was already there. Can money buy love? No, but it can make it easier to fall. It's easy to love something when it's easy, when your bills are taken care of, when food is good and wine is flowing. Do you love him? Only you can answer that, but if you have to ask, then I don't think you do. Money is nice, I can't overstate that, but love is a completely different ball game. Would you be with him if he was broke? Is a good question to start with. Are you using him? Is the using mutual? Are other questions you can ask yourself to figure out whether you love him or his money more.  *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
