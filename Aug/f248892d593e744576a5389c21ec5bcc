Dear Brenda, I love my girlfriend very much. I want to marry her one day. But I know some men at work have been asking her out. She is very beautiful. I snooped into her phone and saw she texted some people that she is happily dating and told them she canâ€™t date them. This made me happy but also guilty of not trusting her. But I also fear that one day another man may convince her to leave me.  Are you a Form One student? Because these actions you are doing are extremely immature. Not only do you not trust your woman for no reason, but you go ahead and violate her privacy. And then after that immature nonsense, when you find nothing, you still think that there might be something wrong coming towards you in the future? At this point, you might as well find an ugly girlfriend, since this seems to be the root of your problem. Would you prefer someone no one is hitting on to make you feel better? Surely if you've seen something in her that is good, someone else will as well. Chema chajiuza and all that. Listen, stop projecting your worries onto your innocent girlfriend. Ask yourself why you are so sure that your relationship is at risk. Is it because you feel your relationship is at risk? Are you doing something risky? Also ask yourself why you value yourself so little that someone will leave you at the first sign of temptation. You need some introspection here, young man, because you're pointing your finger at your girl but there are four more pointing back at you. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
