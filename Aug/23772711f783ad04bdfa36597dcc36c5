Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has been arrested by anti-corruption detectives and is set to be charged in court for abuse of office, money laundering, bribery, conflict of interest and failure to protect public property. Dr Kidero arrived at Integrity Centre at around 5.20pm Wednesday in a green Toyota Land Cruiser vehicle accompanied by detectives from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). The former governor told journalists that he was not aware why he had been arrested. ABUSE OF OFFICE But EACC CEO Halakhe Waqo said in a statement that the commission has been conducting investigations into allegations of abuse of office, money laundering, bribery, conflict of interest and failure to protect public property by senior government officials including Dr Kidero. Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji, who consented to the arrest and charging of Dr Kidero and other suspects, said in a tweet that there is sufficient evidence to charge them with several offences of corruption and economic crimes. A source at Integrity Centre (the EACC headquarters) said the suspects would be interrogated before being charged. Others who will be charged alongside Dr Kidero are Lilian Wanjiru, Jimmy Mutuku, Gregory Mwakanongo, Stephen Ogago, Luke Mugo, Maurice Ochieng, John Githua, Grace Njeri, Lodwar Wholesalers Ltd and Ngurumani Traders Ltd.
