Nairobi retained the overall winners title of this year’s Kenya Inter County Sports and Cultural Association (Kicosca) Games that came to an end Saturday in Kisii. The richest county in the country collecting 32 points that ensured they keep the title they won last year in Machakos. Nairobi topped in nine disciplines - chess, table tennis, ajua, cultural dance, darts, basketball, tug of war both men and women, badminton and netball. Uasin Gishu finished second after bagging 13 points. They finished to in three disciplines - athletics and volleyball men and women. Hosts Kisii finished third with 10 points. West Pokot, Kiambu, Nakuru Mombasa and Bungoma followed in that order. The Kicosca secretary general Muraya Kabiri said Kisii hosted the most successful edition commending the county’s governor James Ongwae for the good preparations he had done for the games. “The games were held in more than 10 venues and all were successful,” he said. Kisii Governor James Ongwae was given a trophy for hosting the most organised edition. In football, Machakos retained their title after beating Bungoma 1-0 at Gusii Stadium before a 10,000 capacity crowd that included ODM party leader Raila Odinga. Festus Kikuvi, a former elite player, from the County Inspectorate department notched the winner five minutes from half time, but had to be taken out for Antony Koko after colliding with Bungoma keeper Moses Ignatius in the process of placing the ball home. Bungoma were better side after resumption following the introduction of Erick Mureka for Wilberforce Kipkania and Kennedy Ekisa who came in for Eric Zaidi. Coached by Christopher Kwoba, Bungoma will only have themselves to blame for wasting several golden chances. The main culprit was Juma Elisha who, on several occasions, failed to covert when he was alone with Machakos goalkeeper Dennis Nzuki. Machakos cleverly ran down the clock.
