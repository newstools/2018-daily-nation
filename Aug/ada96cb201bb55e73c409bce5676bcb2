Bungoma will face defending champions Machakos in the Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association (Kicosca) Games football final on Saturday after squeaking through the semi-finals on penalty shoot-outs on Thursday. Bungoma shot down home side Kisii 3-2 in a tense post-match penalties duel after the two sides had locked level 1-1 after 120 minutes of play at Gusii Stadium. Midfielder Conard Manyange had given Kisii the lead on 15 minutes only for Bungoma’s captain Simon Kiveu to restore parity in the 70th minute to take the match to extra into time and then the lottery of penalty kicks. “From the beginning we were determined to register a good performance and now we are in the final,” said Kiveu. In the second semi-final, well attended at Kisii High School, Machakos beat Nakuru 2-1. Kiambu men dethroned Nakuru 40-29 at Cardinal Otunga High School to become the Kicosca basketball champions. Kiambu led 8-7 in the first quarter before gradually pulling away 21-14 at half time and never looking back. The richest county in the country Nairobi got themselves on the champions list, downing Uasin Gishu 43-21 to retain the women’s basketball crown. Nairobi women’s team basketball coach Phillip Osore said they were better prepared. “I thank Mike Sonko’s leadership for the full support they offered. The county government gave us enough time to train for three months non-stop and today we are happy we have taken the cup for good after winning it since the County Games started in 2013.” Osore, who is also a Class One referee, singled out star players Eunice Ouma and Carolyne Achieng’ for their outstanding performance throughout the tournament. Nakuru men basketball player/coach, Michael Oluoch said his team lost to Kiambu because their opponents had numbers and bench power. Bungoma beat Uasin Gishu 30-20 to settle for bronze in the men’s category while Machakos saw off Bungoma 24-10 to clinch women’s third spot. In netball, Nairobi led by talented Carolyne Achieng’ retained their title beating Bungoma 35-25. They qualified after eliminating Devolution 37-14 in the semis.
