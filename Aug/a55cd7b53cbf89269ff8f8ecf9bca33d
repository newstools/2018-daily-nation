The revelation that the government could be using inaccurate data for planning because nearly 20 million births and deaths records have not been properly documented calls for an urgent remedy. Indeed, this is a damning feedback, considering the substantial investment in personnel and facilities over the years in an effort to streamline the registration of persons. According to a new report, only 16 million births have been captured in the government’s digitised records system. It simply means that more than half of the national population is not properly listed. The ‘Productivity Improvement of Civil Registration Services’ report, compiled by a group of experts in June, also reveals that only 589,711 deaths have been entered into the digitised records. NATIONAL PLANNING The report also says the Department of Civil Registration Services has documented 64 per cent of all the births in the country while only 42 per cent of deaths were captured. This means that more than half of those who have died have not been registered. Accurate records are crucial for comprehensive national planning and the subsequent allocation of resources. It is critical, therefore, that records are properly generated to document these vital numbers. As Director of Civil Registration Services Janet Mucheru has emphasised, accurate data on births and deaths is needed for informed government planning. PROVISION OF SERVICES A comprehensive record of births enables the authorities to work with precise numbers in planning for the provision of services such as healthcare and education. There is also the grave danger of infiltration by illegal foreigners taking advantage of the failure to accurately document and capture the number of citizens to illegally gain citizenship. There is a risk of underproviding or catering for non-existent people, thus distorting the situation.
