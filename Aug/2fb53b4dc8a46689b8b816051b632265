Residents of Getarwet in Kericho on Saturday barricaded Kericho-Litein road to protest the killing of a Form One student by unknown people the previous night. Mr Elias Kibet, a student at Getarwet Secondary School, was found dead in his room behind their family shop. The chilling incident angered locals who were still coming to terms with the murder of a couple in neighbouring Chesingoro village less than two weeks ago. The residents accused the police of laxity over the rising crime.   Mr Geoffrey Rono, a resident, accused the police of releasing suspects in the murder of the teacher and his wife despite "sufficient evidence." "We have had enough of insecurity in this regard. The death of this young boy is a wake-up call that we surely do not have security and that we should take law into our own hands," said Mr Rono.   The student's mother, Ms Alice Ngâ€™eno, learnt of his death in the morning. "A client had gone to the shop to buy sugar, but he found it still closed. When he went behind the shop where my son sleeps, he returned screaming," said the mother. Tension is still high at the scene as residents have blocked the police from taking the body. Earlier, the police used teargas to disperse hundreds of protesters that barricaded the road. Energy CS Charles Keter visited the scene in bid to calm the angry residents. "I am aware of the security issues that you are undergoing. We want answers to the wave of killings here. We will have a meeting with my colleague in the security docket to address the matter," said Mr Keter.   Body of the high school teacher was found with stab wounds while the wife's eyes were gorged out.
