The voluntary surrender by some individuals of title deeds to irregularly allocated land is an interesting turning point in the ongoing crackdown against buildings constructed on riparian land and other unauthorised sites in Nairobi and other towns. And it doesnâ€™t matter just how many have already come forward and handed in their titles. It is a welcome gesture against impunity. These people stand to lose the money spent on the land and will now have to forget about the earnings they had hoped to make soon. However, the message from their decisions to withdraw their claim to the land is a welcome vote in the public interest. The consequences for interfering with riparian land and the pollution of water sources are devastating for all. DUE DILLIGENCE But perhaps even more important is that fact that these irregular allocations and construction are manifestations of the perennial endemic corruption. As we condemn the officials who irregularly allocated the land and the beneficiaries who built on it, the latter are equally culpable. With a little due diligence, they would have adhered to the rules and regulations and development plans prohibiting such projects in those areas. LAUDABLE GESTURE The surrender of the title deeds is a laudable gesture. However, it is possible that there are many other beneficiaries who are either too shy or ashamed to own up and who need be encouraged to come forward. This is why it would be a good idea for the authorities to grant an amnesty, giving clear and reasonable guidelines and deadlines and a token compensation for the volunteers to enable more to do the right thing. The momentum against the illicit goings on must be stepped up to ensure that all projects strictly follow the laid-down regulations. This is a great opportunity to ensure that never again shall a few individuals so blatantly circumvent the rules and entrench lawlessness and disorder.
