We congratulate Gor Mahia for winning their 17th SportPesa Premier League title with six matches to go. Once again, Gor have been a revelation this season, showing pedigree and class. The icing on the cake was defeating arch-rivals AFC Leopards in Nairobi on Saturday in the “Mashemeji Derby”. Gor were the first club to win the league title under the sponsorship of gaming giant SportPesa in 2015. Tusker halted the sequence in 2016, but Gor resurfaced to win it twice in a row. Winning the title does not only come with a Sh4.5 million prize money, but also a ticket to once again represent Kenya in the Confederation of African Football (Caf) Champions League next year. No Kenyan club has won Caf Champions League, with Gor reaching the knockout stage last in 1992, only to lose in the quarter-finals. MANDELA CUP Gor is the only Kenyan team to win a continental event — the Caf Confederation Cup, then Mandela Cup, in 1987. Gor have bowed out in the first round of the Champions League in the past two years. This year, they have been relegated to the Confederation Cup, where they must beat USM Alger in Algeria on Wednesday to qualify to the knockouts after they ruined their chances by losing to Rwanda’s Rayon Sports 2-1 in Nairobi. They now need to up their stakes if they are to perform well in the lucrative Champions League, whose top prize is Sh250 million. FACILITATE TRAVEL It’s a shame that Gor are begging around for funds to facilitate their travel at a time when they should be having the right marketing and fundraising machinery in place. We also take this opportunity to condemn the hooliganism witnessed during the Gor-AFC derby at Kasarani. Football Kenya Federation and Kenya Premier League must investigate the ugly incidents and pursue and punish the culprits.
