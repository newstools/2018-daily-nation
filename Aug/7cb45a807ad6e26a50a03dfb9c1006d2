The 20th memorial of the 1998 bomb blast in Nairobi is currently under way at the August 7th Memorial Park and Museum. Families and friends of those who perished during the explosion that shook the nation are gathered at the park to remember their loved ones. Also in attendance are survivors of the tragedy. The candle-lit memorial is a private affair, with only close relatives of the victims admitted into the park. Attendees have laid wreathes of flowers at the memorial wall on which the names of the 218 Kenyans and Americans who died are engraved. The attack masterminded by Al-Qaeda, then led by Osama bin Laden, targeted at the US Embassy in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.   The blast claimed the lives of 213 Kenyans, 12 Americans and a Rwandese. More than 4000 others, the majority Kenyans, were injured. US ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec is among key representatives of the US government at the memorial.   Terrorists had a perfect cover through the companies and NGOs they registered.
