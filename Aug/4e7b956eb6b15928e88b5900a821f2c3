The Teachers Service Commission on Friday denied a claim by the Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) that it will promote more than 30,000 teachers who have acquired higher degrees. In a press statement, head of corporate communication Kihumba Kimotho said there are no pending cases of promotion to be effected. Mr Kimotho added that promotions will only be done when due and within the 2017-2021 collective bargaining agreement framework signed between TSC and the Knut. "During yesterday's (Thursday) meeting there was no discussion of the purported pending cases of promotion for the 30,000 teachers," Mr Kimotho said. "It is misleading to teachers for anybody to appear to be committing TSC on promotion outside the CBA framework and existing policy. This creates unnecessary and unwanted expectations." On Thursday the TSC and Knut officials held a six-hour meeting at the TSC offices where the union agreed to call off the planned strike to allow for negotiations. Knut is pushing for the abolition of teacher appraisal and delocalisation policy, and have the TSC sponsor teachers to undertake the Teacher Performance Development programme. Mr Kimotho said all the issues raised by Knut will discussed during a five-day retreat.   The national examinations set for October and November will take place as parties engage in talks.
