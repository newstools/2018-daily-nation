Former Transport Cabinet Secretary Michael Kamau has sued the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji and the Milimani Anti-Corruption Court. The former CS, who was charged in July with the offenses of abuse office and wilful failure to comply with guidelines relating to the management of public funds, seeks to temporarily suspend a fresh trial. Through lawyer James Orengo, Mr Kamau argues that he was charged with a defective charge sheet and that he is not opposed to taking plea. REDESIGN ROAD "The continuation of criminal proceedings founded upon an illegality and in deprivation of any rights as well as fundamental freedoms goes against inherent principles and policy in the administration of criminal justice," said Mr Orengo, who is also the Siaya Senator. He added: "There must be avoidance of anything that savours of oppression and that where such arises, it must be dealt with at the earliest opportunity."
