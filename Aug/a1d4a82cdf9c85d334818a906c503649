Visiting Bidco United frustrated promotion-chasing Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) to a goalless draw in a National Super League (NSL) match at Camp Toyoyo grounds on Friday. Earlier on at the same venue, Kefa Maliach scored at the death as Kisumu AllStars edged out Administration Police by a solitary goal. Victory saw AllStars move three places up to eighth position with 36 points. The John Kamau-coached KCB are now a point adrift of leaders Western Stima and Ushuru - who are tied at the summit on 52 points. Stima welcome Nakuru AllStars in one of the two fixtures lined up for Saturday aiming to open a three-point gap as the taxmen are not in action this weekend. Bidco meanwhile remain fifth on the 19-team log with 46 points while Golden Field Evangelism (GFE), who fell 2-0 to Kenya Police at Karuturi grounds, sink further at the bottom of the log. Kenya Police consolidated their seventh spot with 38 points after 27 rounds. Isibania, fresh from holding Coast Stima to a scoreless draw last weekend, host Nairobi Stima, who shocked Ushuru 2-1 in their previous match, at Awendo Green Stadium in another Saturday clash. On Sunday, Coast Stima will be in Nairobi to face Kangemi AllStars as sixth-placed City Stars entertains St. Joseph’s Youth with both ties scheduled for Camp Toyoyo grounds.
