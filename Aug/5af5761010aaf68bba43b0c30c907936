HARARE, Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa said Friday that he was "humbled" to have won the country's landmark election, hailing it as a "new beginning" after the ousting of autocrat Robert Mugabe. "Thank you Zimbabwe! I am humbled to be elected President of the Second Republic of Zimbabwe," he said in a Twitter message. "Though we may have been divided at the polls, we are united in our dreams. This is a new beginning," the message added. "Let us join hands, in peace, unity & love, & together build a new Zimbabwe for all!" The message came shortly after Zimbabwe's electoral commission declared Mnangagwa the winner with 50.8 percent of the vote â€” avoiding a run-off by the narrowest of margins.   With all 10 provinces declared, Mr Mnangagwa won 50.8 percent of votes to 44.3 percent for opposition leader Nelson Chamisa.
