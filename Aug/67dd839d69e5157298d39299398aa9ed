Former Barcelona Marathon champion Valary Jemeli and reigning Lagos Marathon title holder Abraham Kiptum Saturday won the individual titles at the eighth Safaricom Iten 10-kilometre road race in Elgeyo Marakwet County. Jemeli ran a brilliant race and beat other competitors in a tight contested competition that started in Burgar and ended in Iten town. The athlete, who trains in Iten, used the home advantage to showcase her running skills by leading in the first 100 metres all the way to the tape. She took control of the race though the 2016 Madoka Half Marathon Lucy Cheruiyot gave her hard time in the hilly areas of the course by closing the gap. Jemeli said she was using the race for speed work ahead of her next marathon in China. "I came here as part of training as I prepare to participate in Beijing Marathon very soon. I’m surprised I emerged the winner and this shows my body is responding well in terms of training," said Jemeli, who was third in Berlin Marathon last year. Jemeli cut the tape in minutes and 18 seconds ahead of Cheruiyot who clocked 33:27.2 while Lydia Njeri was in third place clocking 33:34.8. In the men’s race, Kiptum, who is also the Kabarak Half Marathon champion, led in 28:39.0 ahead of Daniel Kipchumba who clocked 29:08.1 while Samuel Chebolei sealed the podium three in 29:09.9. Kiptum, who is seeking to retain his title for the third time in Lagos next year, used the race to sharpen his skills ahead of the race. "I’m happy to have won today and I was using the race as part of preparation towards the Lagos Marathon where I want to defend my title for the third time," said the Mosoriot-based athlete.
