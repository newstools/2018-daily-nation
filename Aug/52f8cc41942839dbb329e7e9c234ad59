Visiting Coast Stima came from a goal down to hold Ushuru to a one-all draw in a National Super League (NSL) contest played at the Camp Toyoyo grounds in Nairobi's Jericho estate on Monday. Ushuru took the lead 10 minutes into time through Stima custodian Said Dhadho, who converted in his own net in an attempt to keep out Anthony Ndolo’s shot that had ricocheted off the crossbar. Stima restored parity through Erick Ngoja in the 70th minute after Ushuru defenders failed to clear their lines allowing the striker finish home from inside the area with the taxmen goalkeeper Isaiah Wakasala helpless. The draw leaves promotion chasing Ushuru second on the 19-team log with 52 points similar to Western Stima, who sit top on a superior goal difference following their convincing 3-0 victory over bottom-placed Golden Field Evangelism on Sunday. Earlier on at the same venue, a goal in either half from Sean Opwora and John Walubuka saw Bidco United edge out Administration Police 2-0 to move fifth on 42 points. “We take in the result positively in order to plan for the next game, we didn’t play according to our strategy which cost us two points,” said Ushuru coach Ken Kenyatta after the game. Stima coach Kinero Swaleh said a point away from home will motivate his boys in the upcoming fixtures. “We conceded early and that affected us in the first half but changed tactic in the final stanza to contain Ushuru until we got the equalizer,” Kinero opined. Ushuru winger Alex Sunga wasted a golden chance to record his name on the scoresheet after restart blasting wide a Billy Oporia cross from the right flank. Erick Ngoja almost equalised a minute later, but his attempt went inches wide before the striker finally changed the score line with 20 minutes remaining. Ushuru, desperate to restore their lead, launched frequent attacks but the visitors were adamant throwing blue shirts at the back for a point away from home that moves them four places up the table on 33 points after 25 rounds.
