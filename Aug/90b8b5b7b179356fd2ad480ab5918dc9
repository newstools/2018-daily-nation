Zimbabwe's opposition MDC party on Friday said it rejected official election results that declared Emmerson Mnangagwa as the new president and vowed to challenge the outcome in court. "They are fake, they are not authentic, we reject them," MDC spokesman Morgan Komichi told AFP. "We will take this to the courts."   With all 10 provinces declared, Mr Mnangagwa won 50.8 percent of votes to 44.3 percent for opposition leader Nelson Chamisa.
