Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi is hosting about 15 MPs from the Coast region. The legislators, drawn from across the political divide, are in a closed-door meeting at Sun N Sand Beach Resort in Kikambala, Kilifi County. Among those in attendance are Coast Parliamentary Group chairman Suleiman Dori, who is the MP for Msambweni Constituency. Others are Paul Katana (Kaloleni), Gertrude Mbeyu (County MP, Kilifi), William Kamoti (Rabai), Ali Mbogo (Kisauni), Badi Twalib (Jomvu), Sharrif Alwy (Lamu East), Stanley Muthama (Lamu West),  and Johnes Mlolwa (Voi). The meeting comes amid heightened political activities in the region and also only days after ODM wrote to two MPs from the region, who have declared their support for Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid. The two are Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and Mr Dori. Ms Jumwa is not attending the meeting with reports that she was unwell. Some MPs allied to Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho have not arrived yet.  They are Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita),  Mishi Mboko (Likoni) and Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi. Others who are yet to arrive for the meeting are Teddy Mwambire (Ganze),  Owen Baya (Kilifi North), Michael Kingi(Magarini) and Kilifi South MP Ken Chonga. Some legislators from Tana River County have also arrived for the meeting.   President Kenyatta’s handlers have been silent on his activities at the Coast.
