The burial ceremony of the former 400m hurdles World champion Nicholas Bett is currently on in his home Simat, Uasin Gishu County. Bett passed on last week in tragic road accident along Cengalo-Lessos-Kapsabet road. Speaking during the ceremony, 400m sprinter Maximilla Imali said that she received the news of his death with shock. "We were with Bett in Nigeria and we went through a lot with the disorganisation that was witnessed during the Africa Championships," said the athlete. Bett was struggling with a hamstring injury which other athletes in camp encouraged him to overcome. "He has gone through a lot concerning the hamstring injury he had and as he was now coming back, his life was cut short. It's so sad and we will always remember his good deeds," she added. The former three-time World 1500m champion Asbel Kiprop said: "Kenya managed to beat the world and among the seven gold medals, two came from the village of Simat," said Kiprop. Other athletes who turned up to pay their last respects to the fallen hero include 2015 World javelin champion Julius Yego, London Marathon champion Vivian Cheruiyot, Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge among others. Deputy President William Ruto is expected to lead other top government officials in the ceremony. Others expected are Lands Cabinet Secretary Farida Karoney, Sports Principal Secretary Kirimi Kaberia, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett and area MP Oscar Sudi.
