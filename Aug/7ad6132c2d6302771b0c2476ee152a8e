Three people have died in a road crash along the North Horr-Ileret road in Marsabit County after a truck carrying goods and passengers overturned after its driver lost control. Those who died include two women and one child. The crash which happened Sunday night but was reported several hours later as those who survived had to walk for a long distance before reaching the Tharathe AP post, some 15 kilometres away. Five of the injured were rushed to Ileret Health Centre and were treated and discharged while several others are receiving treatment at North Horr hospital. BRAKES FAILED According to one of the survivors, Rama Saku, the driver of the lorry lost control after the brakes failed. “When we were going uphill, the vehicle’s breaks had failed. The driver tried to control it but unfortunately it overturned. My son helped us out; he is actually the one who saved us together with the driver. We could have died,” she said. The goods on transit fell on some of the passengers, injuring them badly when the lorry overturned. “Some passengers bled to death as there was no immediate medical assistance because the AP post was far from the scene,” she said. The lorry was carrying foodstuffs, motorcycles, cement and metal boxes among other items. Ms Beatrice Lentorjin, the nurse in-charge of Ileret Health Centre said they received four casualties, all men, noting that others were rushed to other hospitals. NO FRACTURES “They were treated and discharged as there were no serious fractures. We understand the rest of the casualties are being treated in North Horr Hospital,” she said. Residents living in parts of North Horr and Marsabit use lorries as means of transport. They would have to alternatively cover long distances on foot. According to the North Horr OCPD Joel Chebii, bodies of the victims were transferred to Kalacha where post-mortem will be conducted. He said that should the driver be found to have been driving an unroadworthy vehicle, he will be charged.
