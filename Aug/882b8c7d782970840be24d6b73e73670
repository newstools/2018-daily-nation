The fight against relegation took a more unpleasant twist for Thika United who lost 1-0 to Vihiga United in a SportPesa Premier League match staged at the Thika Municipal Stadium on Sunday. A second half goal from Amos Kigadi saw Vihiga collect their seventh win of the season as Thika remained at the very base of the SPL table with a measly 20 points from 27 games. Kigadi tilted the scales in the 66th minute, when he headed in a long free kick curved beautifully by former Kakamega Homeboyz and Chemelil Sugar forward Steven Wakhanya. Despite the narrow score line, Vihiga were the dominant side in the match, and could have recorded their first goal in the third minute when Michael Isabwa was teed up by Vincent Wonder only for him to head the ball over the bar with Thika custodian Allan Owiny well beaten. Kigadi had another good chance at the stroke of half time when he found himself with only the goalkeeper to beat. Instead of looping the ball over the onrushing Owiny however, Kigadi sent a feeble shot towards goal which was easily collected by the Ugandan goalkeeper. The defeat marked Thika’s fourth loss in five games, and they have collected only four wins since the season began this March. In another match staged in Kericho, Mathare United put last weekend’s disappointment behind them as they settled for a one-all draw with Zoo Kericho. Mathare, who had suffered an embarrassing 4-0 loss to Nakumatt last weekend, went off to a 28th minute lead courtesy of a goal by Roy Okal, but this was cancelled out by Johnston Ligare who netted for Zoo in the 52nd minute. The draw now leaves the slum boys in seventh position on the SPL table with 39 points, as Zoo occupy 13th place ahead of their next duel against league champions Gor Mahia.
