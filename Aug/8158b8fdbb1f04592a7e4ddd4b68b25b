Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday met a section of leaders from the Nakuru County Assembly at his Karen home. The Nakuru MCAs were led by Nakuru Deputy Governor Eric Korir and County Assembly Speaker Joel Kairu. Details of the meeting remained scanty, but a source who attended the closed-door meeting told the Nation that Mr Ruto wants to work directly with the MCAs to consolidate his political base. Another source privy to the meeting said the leaders also took the moment to lobby for development projects for Nakuru. “The leaders met to discuss about development matters touching on Nakuru,” said the source. This is not the first time Mr Ruto met with leaders from Nakuru. In March, Governor Lee Kinyanjui led a delegation of Nakuru leaders to Mr Ruto’s Karen office. A statement from the Deputy President then, said the meeting was pegged on the need for a peaceful region. On Tuesday, Mr Ruto met with MCAs from Vihiga County and in the afternoon, he met Murang'a County leaders led by their Governor Mwangi wa Iria.
