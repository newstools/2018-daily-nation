The high court on Wednesday upheld the election of Olpusimoru Ward Representative Wilfred ole Kuyo. Judge Justus Bwonwong’a said the poll was conducted credibly. Mr Kuyo had filed an appeal in February after Narok Principal Magistrate Titus Gesora nullified his win, arguing that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission failed to conduct a free and fair exercise, ordering a by-election. The ODM member's victory had been challenged by former MCA Wilson Masikonte of Jubilee Party. Mr Kuyo was accused of using witchcraft to win the election on August 8 last year. It was reported that he hired a witchdoctor who slaughtered a colobus monkey and performed rituals to help him win. Judge Bwonwong’a ordered Mr Masikonde to pay Sh120,000 as costs incurred by the IEBC and Mr Kuyo. Mr Kuyo's supporters celebrated the verdict. Mr Kuyo extended an olive branch to his challenger asking him to embrace peace to farther the region's development.   Police says tension may be linked to the election petition pending in court.
