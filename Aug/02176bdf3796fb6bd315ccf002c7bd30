Mombasa businessman Said Abdalla alias Saido said the initiative will assist needy children to progress instead of despairing in life. Mr Abdalla urged other groups and organisations to emulate the riders in assisting the poor and needy children access decent and proper education. COOPERATION One the riders, Olive Ogembo, applauded the cooperation which they got during the three-day event. She called for support for their initiative to economically empower the less fortunate in society and assured the county government they will collaborate with them in future initiatives.
