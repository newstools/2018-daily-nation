Uganda’s Deputy Speaker of Parliament Jacob Oulanyah says the kidneys of detained and Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, are fine. According to Oulanyah, tests were conducted at St Mary’s Hospital Lacor on Thursday. A team of doctors under the prison’s head of medical department, Joseph Andama, carried out the tests. MEDICAL TESTS “The doctors conducted urine and blood tests and found out that his kidneys were OK,” Mr Oulanyah told journalists in Gulu. He, however, added that Bobi Wine, who could hardly walk the day he was produced in court, is to undergo blood screening and liver tests. He spoke to journalists after visiting Bobi Wine and three MPs who are in remand at Gulu Central Prison. Bobi Wine was remanded on Thursday after the military court dropped illegal firearm charges against him. He was rearrested shortly after and charged with treason in a magistrate’s court. “The lawmaker is still in pain but is much better than three days ago. I think the prison environment is much different from where he was being held previously. He is more relaxed,” the deputy Speaker said. Bobi Wine was being held at Makindye barracks before being rearrested. Oulanyah said Jinja East MP Paul Mwiru, who is in the same prison, dislocated a shoulder but “he has been attended to”. The accused will reappear in court on August 30. Meanwhile, a person died after being shot by a policeman during a protest over the detention of Bobi Wine. Regional police chief Francis Chemusto said officers were responding to a protest in the hometown of the MP in Bukalamuli, some 120 kilometres west of Kampala. “Protesters were burning tyres in the middle of the road. When officers ordered them to stop, one man rushed to his house and picked up an axe and a panga and charged towards an officer, who shot him,” Chemusto said.
