Four Kenya Commercial Bank employees suspected of stealing Sh72.6 million are set to face charges after they were arrested on August 17. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Mr Benson Mwai Karugu, Mr Edmund Kirturi Mutua, Mr Evans Kenda Kiplagat and Mr Macdonald Mochama Mongwe transferred the money in small amounts to accounts domiciled with various banks in Nairobi, Mombasa, Eldoret and Malindi. Evidence gathered by the DCI indicates that 37 fictitious merchant companies were registered with KCB to facilitate the theft through fraudulent point of sale card (POS) transaction. It is alleged that the claims were approved by the four suspects and money sent to the companiesâ€™ account as POS card settlements. The DCI further reports that the funds were later shared through M-Pesa among the four suspects. Last week, DCI boss George Kinoti raised concern over banks and Sacco frauds, arguing that most frauds are inside jobs. He has advised the institutions to thoroughly vet their current and potential employees in order to avert such bank fraud that has been on the rise in the recent past.   'Bank heist of the year' was conceived over a cup of tea.
