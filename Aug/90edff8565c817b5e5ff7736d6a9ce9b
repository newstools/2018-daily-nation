Murang’a County residents have lynched a man suspected to have defiled a three-year old girl. The 36-year-old man identified as Julius Wouta Mose is said to have committed the act in Mukoma village, Kiharu, at 6pm. Kigumo Administration Police commander Samuel Kobe said Mose was a casual labourer, and had come from Kisii. "It’s unfortunate that instead of residents taking the suspect to the police or conducting a citizen arrest so that we take him to court, they decided to kill him. I warn them that killing a suspect is illegal and they can be charged for that," Mr Kobe said. He said police are investigating rampant cases of defilement in the constituency. Two months ago a nine-year-old girl from Muthithi village was defiled, murdered and her body dumped in a maize plantation. Also in Muthithi, a 70-year-old man was beaten after being accused of attempting to defile a seven-year-old girl. On Thursday this week, a man, 65, from Kiharu was charged with attempting to defile his grandchild. He denied the charges and was released with a Sh200,000 bond.
