The Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has formed a committee to oversee the burial of the former world 400 metres hurdles champion Nicholas Bett. Athletics Kenya National Police Service chairman Joseph Kiget will head the committee that has representatives from different departments, a representative from Athletics Kenya's headquarters and the sports ministry. While the police will take the lead in funeral arrangements, Kiget said they will also liaise with other committees former by the family and athletes to make sure all run smoothly. “Athletes have formed their own committee, which is a people driven initiative, while there is another one at home but at some stage, we shall amalgamate them and share notes,” said Kiget. “Bett was a great man and that is why everyone who knew him wants to be involved.” The Principal Secretary in the State Department of Sports, Kirimi Kaberia, said the ministry will rally behind the National Police Service’s initiate to see that Bett is given a befitting send-off. “It’s needless to form more committees when the Kenya Police are taking the lead. We shall support them to have Bett get a heroic burial,” said Kaberia.   Bett was involved in an accident along the Cengalo-Lessos-Kapsabet road.
