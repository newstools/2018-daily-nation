Laikipia County Assembly has put the executive to task over money spent on promoting the county as a tourist destination. The MCAs on Thursday trashed a report presented by the chairman of Trade, Tourism and Co-operative Committee Stephen Kamau which indicated that Sh802,830 was spent on an event dubbed “Destination Laikipia” held in June this year. They questioned how the services were procured and how residents benefited. Some of the expenses include purchase of fireworks at a cost of Sh262,800 and photography and videography services.
