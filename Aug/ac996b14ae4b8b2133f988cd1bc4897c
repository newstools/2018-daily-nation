Nine people, among them children, have died and several others injured in an accident at Kimende on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The accident involving a 14- seater matatu and a lorry, occured a few minutes before 11pm on Tuesday. The matatu, according to witnesses, was heading to Nakuru when it collided head on with a Nairobi-bound lorry. Mr John Kamande, a witness, said six people died on the spot while three others died on the way to Kijabe Mission Hospital. SUSTAINED INJURIES In another accident, four people died while five others sustained injuries after a lorry veered off the road in Roret, Kericho County, on Tuesday evening. The driver of the lorry that was ferrying sand from Sondu in Kisumu County lost control of the vehicle. Kericho County Commander James Mugera said the lorry ran over three pedestrians on the Roret-Sigowet road. The fourth victim was killed inside a cyber cafe. “The lorry developed a mechanical problem while at a steep area. The driver lost control of the vehicle and ran over the three pedestrians before crashing into a building, killing another person,” said Mr Mugera. The injured were taken to Litein Mission Hospital and Kapkatet Sub-County hospital. DIVERSION Roret Chief, Richard Ngeno, has called for the diversion of the road away from the trading centre to avoid accidents in future. “The steep part of the road cuts through the middle of Roret trading centre hence posing great danger to motorists, pedestrians and traders,” he said.
