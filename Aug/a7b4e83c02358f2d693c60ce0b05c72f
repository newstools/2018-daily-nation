Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) has differed with Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) over plan to go on strike over appraisals and transfers. Kuppet Chairman Omboko Milemba on Tuesday asked teachers to ignore the call, saying the issues Knut has raised can be handled through talks. “Teachers do not need to go on strike at this time. There are no reasons,” said Mr Milemba in an interview with Nation. “As Kuppet we believe in engaging our employers and not through unnecessary strikes which will interfere with learning in schools.” Knut Secretary-General Wilson Sossion has threatened to lead teachers in the strike from September 1 to push the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to drop performance appraisal for teachers. The union also wants TSC to stop its delocalisation programme, which has seen 1,065 principals transferred since December 2017.   Knut threatens strike from September 1.
