Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has yet again suspended two senior officers over what he termed as laxity at work. Health Executive Hitan Majevdia and County Health Director Thomas Ogaro have been given 14 days to explain why health facilities in Nairobi County lack medicine besides having poor services. "The governor has suspended Health Executive Member Majevdia Hitan and County Health Director Thomas Ogaro over laxity. [He] gives them 14 days to explain why Nairobi County medical facilities have poor services and lack medicines," read the communication from the Director of Communications Elkana Jacob. CONFIRMED Mr Majevdia confirmed that he has been suspended but said he is yet to get an official communication on the same. This comes only two days after the City Hall boss also suspended three officers – Chief of staff Brian Mugo, acting Chief Finance Officer Ekaya Alumasi and acting head of County Treasury Stephen Mutua – accusing them of misuse of public funds. Governor Sonko, who has since forwarded the names of the three to the Director of Criminal Investigations, has stated that those found culpable will face the full force of the law. “There was an intelligence report showing they had misused county resources. Internal investigations have implicated them,” said a communication from the governor’s office.
