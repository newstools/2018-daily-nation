The University of Nairobi has announced austerity measures that include a crackdown on students who cook in hostels in its latest efforts to cut down on expenditure. Vice-Chancellor Peter Mbithi has directed staff at the university to increase surveillance and regular inspections to stop cooking in students’ hostels. “Monitor to ensure [there is] no cooking in hostels. Students should be sensitised on the use of facilities,” reads a report tabled before the university’s senate on Thursday. The university banned students from cooking in hostels in 2016. METER READING Prof Mbithi also directed that the joint meter reading be enforced as well as installation of sensor lights, adoption of other alternative sources of energy such as solar, wind or biogas, use of flood lights and energy saving bulbs among others. The new measures are expected to save the institution Sh12 million annually. Prof Mbithi also wants joint water meter reading to be enforced while regular inspection of water pipes will be done to check underground leakages, saying this will enable the university save Sh6 million. He also directed that fuel cards allocations be reduced and discouraged fuel card top ups. VEHICLE TRACKING At the same time, vehicle tracking systems will be installed in all new vehicles to ensure better control. The staff at the institution will also be required to vacate leased premises and move to offices at the UoN Tower. The University is also to cut down on outsourced security services and seek the same from the National Youth Services. Lecturers in Nairobi will not travel to teach in Kisumu and Mombasa campuses. Instead, the university will hire part-time lecturers. There will also be a limit on travelling outside the country as well as consolidation of adverts to minimise costs. “ The latest move is an attempt by the university to ensure good financial management in the face of dwindling funding from the exchequer.
