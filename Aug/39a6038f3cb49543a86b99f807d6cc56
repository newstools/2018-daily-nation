Saturday's clash between Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards will be the 89th Mashemeji Derby and is one that promises to be a whopper. The match will be played on the lush green grass of the Kasarani Stadium that was opened for public use last month after months of refurbishment. In recent times, Ingwe have been left with egg on their faces, and a loss on Saturday will be even more undesirable as it will not only see the big cats cede bragging rights, it will also help K’Ogalo secure an unprecedented 17th SportPesa Premier League title. Last time this match was played was on July 22, when K’Ogalo won by a 2-1 score line in what was the second Mashemeji Derby for current Ingwe coach Rodolfo Zapata. Gor’s Dylan Kerr has been in charge of three such games, drawing once and winning twice. In their past 88 meetings, both sides have won 28 times, with 32 fixtures ending in a draw. In as far as the 2018 season is concerned, Gor come out as overwhelming favourites based on their prime position on the SPL table, although their 2-1 losses against Bandari and Rayon Sports in the Caf Confederation Cup this month stains their otherwise perfect record. Gor are sitting pretty at the summit of the standings with 68 points, a massive 20 ahead of second-placed Bandari, while Leopards are third in the 18-table log with the same 48 points, albeit an inferior goal difference. Having blown hot and cold throughout the season, Ingwe seem to be recovering fast, and have built an unbeaten run spanning four league matches. Gor recovered from the 2-1 loss to Bandari and are also unbeaten in four league games in a row. The game will kick off at 4pm at Kasarani Saturday afternoon, and tickets will be sold at Sh200 and Sh1000 at the match venue stadium starting from 11am.
