A cloud of grief has engulfed Mukuru-Kaiyaba slum in South B, Nairobi, after a woman chopped off her husband’s genitals using a kitchen knife on Thursday night. Mr Godfrey Namale, 45, a cart puller in Nairobi’s Industrial Area, alleged that he was deep asleep when he was attacked. “After job, I went out for a drink after a hard day’s work before I went back home and retired to bed. I suddenly felt severe pain in my genitals, before I saw blood oozing from my private parts. My wife was standing next to me with a bloodstained kitchen knife in her hand,” he recalled. Mr Godfrey Namale, 45, from Bukura in Kakamega County, said he has been married to Ms Esther Namale for the past 20 years. BITTER QUARREL Area slum chairman Mr Jacob Ibrahim Mohammed said his team and other residents rushed Mr Namale to the nearby Crescent Hospital where he was treated. Police and medical documents seen by the Nation showed that the case was reported at Industrial Area O/B No 39/24/8/2018. During the interview on Saturday, Mr Namale, who appeared to be in pain, watched helplessly as his wife engaged the Nyumba Kumi members in a quarrel. DESTROYED PHONE The mother of two, who did not spare the media either, accused them of exposing her to the public. During the interview, the suspect also snatched a phone from a family friend and destroyed it. “She was bitter when she learnt that I was calling our upcountry area chief to inform him on the matter. They have been having family feuds time and again here in Nairobi and in Kakamega,” said Mr Kunyili. The suspect, who accused the slum security chairman of favouritism, later escaped.
