Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has warned wardens against smuggling drugs and phones into prisons. Speaking at Nyeri Main Prison on Wednesday, Dr Matiang’i said the mobile phones are used to defraud Kenyans. "Some of you make it difficult for police officers to do their job. We know some of you help sneak drugs like bhang to inmates," he said. "Those who are making life difficult for us will be removed from the system. We cannot keep you," he added. Dr Matiang’i said investigations are under way to identify wardens behind phone scams. At the same time, he promised to address the welfare of prison wardens and police officers. "We will also look into your welfare as we do the same for the police. That includes better housing and medical cover," he said.
