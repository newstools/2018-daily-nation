The court has allowed lock-up of five Homa Bay County Assembly officials and former staff charged with embezzlement of Sh27.8 million. The five officials who were on Friday denied bail by Homa Bay Senior Principal Magistrate Thomas Obuto are Caroline Chepkemoi Sang', Michael Owino Ooro, Isaac Nyandege, Judith Akinyi Omogi and Edwin Omondi Okello. The five suspects were charged with conspiracy to embezzle Sh27,872,278 during the financial years 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, purportedly as facilitation for travel, conference accommodation and allowances for ward representatives and other assembly staff. The officials also faced ten other corruption-related charges, including unlawful acquisition of public property and abuse of office. The lawyer for the accused Samul Nyauke pleaded with the court to release the officials on bail or bond. "The accused are still innocent and have been abiding with court summons since the beginning of the matter. They should not be denied bond," argued Lawyer Nyauke. In his argument, Lawyer Nyauke told the court the Sh27.8 million the accused have been held for allegedly stealing is insignificant compared to other cases where suspects have been charged with stealing billions. However, the state lawyer Hellen Mutellah convinced the court to deny them bail by citing other ongoing corruption-related investigations involving the accused. ARREST WARRANT The magistrate also issued arrest warrant against assembly clerk Bob Kephers and accountant Maurice Amek. The duo disappeared on Thursday after the Director of Public Prosecutions ordered their arrest over the alleged loss of public funds.   DPP directs EACC to arrest the seven officials and charge them with funds embezzlement.
