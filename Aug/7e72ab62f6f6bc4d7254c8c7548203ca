Have you lost a laptop recently while attending a meeting in Nairobi? Well, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations has asked those affected to contact their Kilimani offices after they recovered 15 laptops in a Saturday operation. The detectives arrested four “notorious” thieves who they said have been stealing laptops from unsuspecting people at meetings in the capital.   The four suspects are Mr Isaiah Aluodo Belek, Mr Amisi Erick Joseph, Mr George Mwangi Maina and Mr Kimani Njagi Kariuki and face charges of handling stolen property.   Detectives released photos of the suspects on their Twitter handle, with one of the pictures showing a screen grab of a smartly-dressed man emerging from building carrying a laptop bag in one of their suspected brazen thefts.
