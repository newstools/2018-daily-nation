Mombasa County cried foul after being eliminated by Migori County by a solitary goal in a nail-biting Pool ‘A’ deciding football match at the ongoing County Assemblies Sports Association (Casa) games festival in Nairobi on Wednesday. The Coastal side alleged that Migori broke competition rules by fielding eight staff members instead of the required six. “The rule states that a team should have six staff members and five MCAs or six MCAs and five staff members on the pitch. Migori had eight staff members. There was no fair play in this match because Migori did not follow the rules. "We had complained before the match and even asked the referee to verify their squad, but nothing changed,” Mombasa player-coach Bernard Ogola said after the match, adding that they decided against paying the Sh5,000 fee to appeal the outcome. The Migori line-up seen by this writer shows they indeed fielded eight staff members. Migori emerged victorious courtesy of a Peter Nyatol goal scored in the 25th minute. Migori began day Three with a goalless draw against Nyandarua and then earned a 2-0 walkover win against Elgeyo-Marakwet, before defeating Mombasa 1-0, who had drawn 0-0 with Nairobi. In women’s volleyball, Trans Nzoia, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Nairobi, Kericho, Kisumu, Uasin Gishu, West Pokot and Senate advanced to the last-eight. Bungoma County, whose women’s team was eliminated after Elgeyo-Marakwet protested, qualified in the men’s round of 16 after defeating Kiambu by 2-0 sets (25-19, 25-14). In netball, Nairobi and Kwale qualified to the round of 16 from Pool ‘A’, as did Homa Bay and Narok from Pool ‘B’, Kilifi and Kericho (Pool C), Kiambu and Tana River (Pool D), Busia and Trans Nzoia (Pool E) and Bungoma and Elgeyo-Marakwet (Pool F). Uasin Gishu and Vihiga made the last 16 from Pool ‘H’.
