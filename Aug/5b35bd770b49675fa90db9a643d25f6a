Big wigs Homeboyz, Mwamba and Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) dominated in their respective pools to qualify for the main cup quarter-finals for the Kabeberi Sevens at Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos on Saturday. Homeboyz enhanced their chances of completing a hat trick when they downed Strathmore Leos 22-7 before rolling over Menengai Oilers 31-12. The Deejays, who won Prinsloo and Sepetuka Sevens, would then dispatch Nakuru 26-19 to top Pool A and storm the quarter-finals. Hosts Mwamba topped Pool B after they crushed Kisumu 24-0 before stopping Kenyatta University’s Blak Blad 22-7. Mwamba, who lost to Homeboyz in the final at Prinsloo and Sepetuka respectively, beat Impala Saracens 19-5 to ease through unbeaten. KCB dug deep in the second half to win their first match against the Kenya Harlequins 17-10. Quins were leading 10-7 at the break but second half saw them soak in two tries from the bankers losing the match 17-10 at full time. The bankers might have struggled to dispatch Kisii 17-14 in their second match but had already booked their place in the quarterfinals after they mauled Masinde Muliro University 19-5. Despite losing to Mwamba, Blak Blad locked out defending champion Impala after they forced a 7-7 draw against them besides crushing Kisumu 36-0. What dealt Impala Saracens the final blow was their 19-5 loss to Mwamba. Blak Blad will now meet Homeboyz in the main cup quarterfinal while Mwamba will take on Nakuru. Trailing from 5-0, Mwamba managed to land three tries from Steve Sikuta, Greg Odhiambo and Collins Injera to send Impala packing. KCB will take on Machine while Kabras Sugar are up against Kenya Harlequin in the other quarterfinal matches. Impala, who retained Kabeberi title last season will now cool their heels in Challenge Trophy quarterfinals where they meet Strathmore.
