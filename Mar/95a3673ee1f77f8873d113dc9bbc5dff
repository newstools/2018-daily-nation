Hi Brenda, I've been dating my boyfriend since I started university four years ago but I find it so hard to relax around him because he hit me once ( he was high as a kite. We were both high) and I’m scared he will do it again even though he apologised and said he would never do it again. What do I do so I can relax around him? Here's what you can do to be more relaxed around him – don't be around him. Alcohol and drugs are not an excuse hit people, no matter how high you are. You see, the thing is, more often than not, drugs bring out someone who was there lurking under the surface the whole time. If he has hit you now, when you are still dating, not even married or with children, then the chances he will hit you again when there is even more at stake are rather high. Your body is trying to clue you in on the fact that you are NOT safe. Listen to your body. Get out.  *** Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?
