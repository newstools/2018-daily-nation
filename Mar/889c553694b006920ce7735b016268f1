Indian expatriates at textiles and apparels subsector will enjoy reduced workers’ permit fees from Sh200,000 to Sh10,000 by the end of this month. Industry, Trade and Co-operatives Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohamed said the incentive is aimed at enabling factories making garments for export to source for specialised skills abroad thereby enabling the expatriates transfer the skills to local workers. “We are looking into barriers that make it difficult for Indian businesses to invest in this country. Starting with the apparels and textiles sector, renewal of permits starting next month will cost Sh10,000 down from Sh200,000,” he said.
