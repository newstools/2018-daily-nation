Bomet East residents have raised concern over the Government’s failure to fund the long proposed tarmacking of the key road from Chebole to Kimuchul. ROADS They raised their concerns as Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday visited Bomet Central to launch the construction of the multimillion-shilling Kamusa-Singorwet-Aisaik-Ndarawetta-Teganda road. They said a roads upgrade would ease transportation of farm produce in the constituency. Mr Richard Yegon, a leader and businessman, said it was unfortunate that roads in Bomet East had been neglected. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy to address the matter as it was a great concern to residents. "The Tenwek-Merigi-Tegat-Chemaner-Kimuchul road is key to development in the region as it connects Bomet to Narok, Nakuru and also Kericho counties. Why it has been sidelined over the years remains a mystery to us," Mr Yegon said. INTEREST Mr Richard Cheruse, an elder, said Bomet East was an agricultural region but farmers were unable to deliver their produce to markets in time due to the poor state of roads. "We are leaving this matter at the doorstep of the Presidency since the local leadership has completely failed to address it, perhaps out of fear or they have other interests that they are fronting," he said. Meanwhile, leaders in the area have questioned why nobody from Bomet was appointed to the Cabinet. This matter is expected to be raised during Mr Ruto’s visit to Bomet County.
