Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa on Saturday asked three Nasa co-principals to shelve plans to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta. Earlier this week, Mr Kalonzo Musyoka said that he, Mr Musalia Mudavadi and Mr Moses Wetang’ula were seeking to meet President Kenyatta, who is currently on a visit to Cuba. MEETING This follows the meeting between Mr Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga on March 9, 2018 in which the two leaders pledged to work together for the benefit of Kenyans. The three co-principals earlier said they were not aware of the meeting. Mr Wamalwa on Saturday said the Head of State and former Prime Minister Odinga already agreed to steer the country towards peace and stability and meeting the other three Nasa leaders would be an exercise in futility. “I am urging Mr Musalia Mudavadi, Mr Moses Wetang’ula and Mr Kalonzo Musyoka to shelve their plans and join their leader Mr Odinga in promoting peace and stability in the country. PRAISE “Once the head of a homestead approaches his neighbour and they agree to resolve a certain issue, the children do not ask for further discussions on a matter that has already been agreed by their father,” said the CS. He spoke in Laikipia North Constituency where he was hosted by area MP Sarah Korere at Ol Kinyei Village during a traditional ceremony for morans (community warriors). Mr Wamalwa praised Mr Odinga for meeting the President and urged Nasa leaders and supporters to back the move. “Let the Nasa co-principals stop grumbling and instead appreciate the gesture by their leader Mr Odinga in working towards stabilising this country politically. “As Kenyans, we all have a duty to promote positive dialogue instead of promoting divisions in the country,” he said.   Kenyans sighed with relief when President Kenyatta and ODM leader vowed to work together.
