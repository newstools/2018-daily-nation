Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has become the sixth lawmaker to lose his seat following a successful petition. The High Court on Friday found that the August 8, 2017 election that Mr Owino won was marred by widespread errors and malpractices. The petition was filed by his rival Mr Francis Mureithi, who lost the race and whose main argument was that there were various sets of results contained in the forms. RESULTS Through lawyer Ham Lagat, Mr Mureithi said the forms were not legible, making it difficult to determine whether the results in Forms 35A corresponded with those in Form 35B. Justice Joseph Sergon agreed with Mr Mureithi that it was difficult to know who won the race. Justice Sergon said violence, irregularities marred the election in Embakasi East and substantially affected the results. Judge Sergon invalidated his election after finding that he also coerced and intimidated IEBC returning officer. The court ordered Babu Owino to pay Sh5 million to IEBC and Mr Mureithi. Ms Owino joins five other MPs who have been dethroned so far. They include Alfred Keter of Nandi Hills, Chris Karani of Ugenya, Markawet East MP Kangogo Bowen, Gatundu North MP Wanjiku Kibe and Lamu West's Stanley Muthama.   More follows.   The campaign was perverted, rules Justice Tripsisa Cherere.
