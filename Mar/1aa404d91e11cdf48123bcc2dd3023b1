Over 500,000 babies missed vaccination during last year’s doctors’ and nurses’ strike, according to a report by the Human Resources for Health (HRH) Kenya. The number of women who died while giving birth in various counties also doubled to 857 from 413 in the six months. The study, which used exploratory data from The District Health Information Software from the month of January to September, was conducted in Kisumu and Kakamega in selected faith-based organisation and public health institutions. VACCINATEThe nurses’ strike lasted for 152 days between June and November while doctors were away from work for 100 days from December 5, 2016 to March 14, last year. READ: Nurses end their 5-month strike READ: Why nurses' strike is taking too long to end According to the findings, when there was no strike, the faith-based organisations immunised only 590 children against measles and 602 on Oral Polio Vaccine. However, during the nurses’ strike, they immunised 890 children against measles and 1,503 children against polio. This means more parents were turning to hospitals managed by religious organisations to immunise their children. Those who could not afford the fees did not take their children for the immunisation. Unvaccinated children are at high risk of measles-related deaths. DEATHS In 2015, the disease killed 134,200 children in Kenya or about 367 every day and 15 every hour. Vaccination resulted in a 79 per cent drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2015 worldwide. From 2000 to 2015, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.3 million deaths globally, making the vaccine one of the best buys in public health management. Measles, a highly contagious disease, can quickly spread through an inadequately vaccinated community. It kills children directly or, more often, by weakening their immune systems, making them susceptible to a host of other infections. PUBLIC HOSPITALSGlobally, the disease kills nearly one million children every year, 450,000 of them in Africa. In 1980, before widespread vaccination, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. All crucial vaccinations are administered free of charge in public hospitals and at a fee in private ones. During the health workers’ strike, various services in the health sector were adversely affected according to the report. There was a decrease in access to HIV testing, a decline in antenatal coverage and prevention of mother-to-child testing services. BIRTH Access to antenatal clinics, prevention of mother-to-child transmission and access to HIV services in public hospitals also decreased from 80,000 in the month of January to 20,000 in the month June 2017. According to the findings, access to antenatal care in public facilities reduced from 25,000 on January 2017 to 6,000 on June 2017 during the nurses’ strike while at the faith-based hospitals, these increased from 2,000 to 18,000. “Access to skilled delivery services in public hospitals reduced from 30,000 to 25,000 during the doctors’ strike and from 30,000 to 12,000 during the nurses’ strike while family planning services reduced from 50,000 to 12,000 between January and June,” the report said. More women, especially those from poor households, were delivering at home with some seeking emergency care late, resulting in the deaths of mothers and newborns. According to Ministry of Health data, national immunisation coverage dropped during the time of the strike. TRAININGThe data also indicated that the number of children without compulsory vaccination of any sort rose from 157,584 to 265,523 between January and July, exposing Kenya to the risk of diseases such as polio, pneumonia and tuberculosis. From the statistics, skilled care during pregnancy declined by 44 per cent while deliveries in health facilities also reduced between January and July. To remedy this challenges, the government launched a campaign targeting 300,000 children below five years who might have missed out on six essential vaccines because of the nurses’ strike. To address the health workers’ strike, HRH Kenya trained union leaders on governance, leadership and management. “The union leaders comprising 13 doctors and 12 nurses and five other cadres underwent a three-day training. The result was more consultative and non-confrontation approach on Collective Bargaining Agreement by the leaders,” the report said. Moving forward, the report recommends the setting up of county level work councils for regular dialogue between unions, health department and public service boards.
