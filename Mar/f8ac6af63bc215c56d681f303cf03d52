An ambitious government plan to have at least one technical training institute in each of the country’s 290 constituencies is at risk due to lack of title deeds. Most of the Technical and Vocational Educational Training (TVET) institutions, whose construction started in 2014, are incomplete and Auditor-General Edward Ouko has questioned the delays. Mr Ouko, in the 2015/2016 financial audit report, says all the institutions were directed not to begin any construction works before the respective area Members of Parliament submitted title deeds for the construction sites. “It was established that 25 institutes stood on land that did not have title deeds as proof of ownership, contrary to the Ministry of Education’s directive. "Consequently, ownership of the land acquired for construction of 60 new TTIs could not be ascertained at the time of audit,” the report says. STUDENTSAfter the completion of the 60 colleges, another 70 new TTIs will also be built across the country to enhance technical training. Currently, there are 99 registered TVET institutions with a total student population of 117,000 against the government target of over 500,000 students. In the audit report, Mr Ouko says a total of Sh51 billion was set aside for the projects. At the proposed Kakrao Technical Training Institute (TTI), which was being mentored by Rongo University in Migori County, Mr Ouko says, a contract worth Sh48.7 million was signed on October 24, 2014. VALUE The contract’s period of 52 weeks was expected to end on October 14, 2015. “Physical verification of the project on September 2016 revealed that the project was still incomplete and no evidence was made available for audit review to show that the contract period was extended beyond 14 October 2015. "Further, no explanation has been provided for the delay in completion of the project. "In the circumstances, the project’s stakeholders may not obtain value for their resources if the project is not completed and put to intended use,” Mr Ouko notes. However, Rongo University Vice-Chancellor Samuel Gudu blamed the stalling of the project on the local Constituency Development Fund (CDF) for failing to remit Sh10 million. TENDEROn the proposed Nyakach TTI in Kisumu County, Mr Ouko says Education ministry, through Kisumu Polytechnic, awarded a Sh55 million construction tender for a period of 52 weeks ending August 23, 2015. “The contract was later revised to Sh60.59 million due to additional works not included in the original design. "Physical inspection and review of the project on January 30, 2017 showed that Sh24.9 million or 41 per cent of the contract sum had been paid to the contractor, while clerk of works records revealed works were at 55 per cent completion level and an extra 79 weeks or 152 per cent of the contract period had lapsed,” he said. However, Mr Ouko says tender minutes approving extension of the project duration beyond August 23, 2015 were not availed for audit review. “It was not clear why the works were way behind schedule despite the ministry and CDF disbursing Sh60.59 million,” the Auditor General notes. EVIDENCEOn proposed Riamo TTI, Mr Ouko says the Ministry, through Kisii National Polytechnic, entered into a contract for construction of the institute at a contract sum of Sh48.6 million. The budget was later varied to Sh51.38 million with no tender minutes and supporting analysis to confirm that the variation was approved by the Kisii National Polytechnic management. He further points out audit queries for the proposed Sh50 million Kaloleni TTI, which was being mentored by Kenya Coast National Polytechnic. “Available information indicates that additional works on septic tank were included and the project period was extended to July 4, 2016. As at September 2016, the project was approximately 45 per cent complete while Sh23 million or about 47 per cent of contract sum had been paid to the contractor,” Mr Ouko says. He added that there was no evidence to show that the contract period was approved for extension beyond July 4, 2016. The ministry did not provide any satisfactory explanation for the delay in completion of the project. LIBRARYAt Kisumu Polytechnic, Mr Ouko says: “As reported in 2014/2015, records maintained by the polytechnic showed that a construction firm was awarded a contract for construction of a library block in November 2011 at a contract price of Sh110.6 million for a duration of 52 weeks.” He, however, notes that expenditure records revealed that Sh110.48 million, representing 99.8 per cent of the initial contract sum, had been paid to the contractor by April 2015. “An audit inspection on September 2016 revealed that no work was going on, since the contractor had abandoned the site and the project was about 70 per cent complete. "No explanation has been provided as to why 99.8 per cent of the contract sum was paid when the project was only 70 per cent complete and therefore way behind schedule,” he says. The polytechnic is also on the spot for allocating Sh500,000 to the Clerk of Works officer who is an employee of the institute. Eldoret Polytechnic is also on the spot over Sh40 million that was to be used for the construction of the Bomet Technical Training Institute under the Economic Stimulus Programme. “There was no clarity on how the contract was managed and project finances administered,” Mr Ouko says.
