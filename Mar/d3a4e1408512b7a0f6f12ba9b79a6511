About 11,000 long distance drivers will go through a refresher course in a bid to reduce road fatalities, the National Transport and Safety Authority has announced. The refresher course, which will be taught using the new curriculum developed by the authority, is currently targeting commuter drivers who operate at night in order to reduce the number of accidents. ROAD CRASHES Majority of fatal crashes, 67 per cent, on Kenyan roads happen at night, the deputy director for safety strategies and county coordination Duncan Kibogon said. The training will take about three months and drivers will get a certificate of competency after the course. "These divers will be the first to get the new smart driving license when they are rolled out. All drivers wishing to apply for the new license must first go through the refresher course," Dr Kibogon said during the launch of the programme. The course will be carried out simultaneously throughout the country in various government training institutions. At the Kabete Technical Training Institute where the launch took place, 102 drivers were present for the training at a cost of Sh 3000 per head. About 54 PSV Saccos and companies licensed to carry passengers at night will benefit from the training. According to Dr Kibogon, the new curriculum will help standardise the teaching of driving in all driving schools. He said this will ensure that all drivers on Kenyan roads are competent and hopes the number of accidents will reduce.
