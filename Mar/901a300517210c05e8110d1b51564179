Legendary rally driver Ian Duncan navigated by Amaar Slatch in a Ford Mustang start as the favourite crew in the Top Fry Classic Safari rally. The motor race has attracted 37 entries including those five drivers from Britain and three from South Africa, and will be flagged off by the Laikipia County Governor Ndiritu Muriithi on Thursday at 8am from Sweetwaters in Nanyuki. It will end on Monday at the Bogoria Hotel. The first car away will be the Porsche 911 of Raaji Bharij and Rajay Sehmi. Duncan is the reigning Kenya Rally champion who has earned an enviable reputation for conquering long distance endurance rallies. The 1,528 kilometre route with 1,011 kilometres of competitive rallying suits his style. Duncan has won a World Rally Championship East African Safari, and two Classic Safari series. But also watch out for the Kabras Sugar Racing team of Baldev Chager, Onkar Rai and Tejveer Rai in similar Porsche 911 cars that are ideally suited for classic rallying. They will want to have a say on the roads. Also in strong contention will be the Top Fry Racing duo of Frank Tundo and his son Carl in Triumph TR7 sports cars. Having won the recent Safari Rally which counted for the Kenya National Championship Tundo and his navigator Tim Jessop are hungry to register another victory. Their Triumph TR7 has been developed and modified to stand up to anticipated rough roads. This was demonstrated by Tundoâ€™s first place finish in the 2017 Classic Safari. South-Africa based Geoff Bell, navigated by Tim Challen, in his 1971 Datsun 240Z will fancy his chances. Geoff has gained great experience in the classic safaris over the years and has a string of top 10 places to his credit. The five-day rally is reminiscent of the motoring adventure style events held in the days of the East Africa Safari in past years. This means that weather conditions may produce surprises and heavy rain and mud will favour drivers who have the experience and skill of coping with slippery wet surfaces.
