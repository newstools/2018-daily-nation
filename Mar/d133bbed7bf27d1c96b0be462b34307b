Kenyans Brian Mutua and Sejal Thakkar gave a good account of themselves but fell against superior opponents to see them fail to advance to the quarter-finals of the ITTF Continental Cup at the Moi International Sport Centre on Thursday. The 19-year-old Mutua lost to 10th seeded Derek Nyoh Ofon from Cameroon in 3-1 sets of 12-14, 13-15, 11-9 and 11-9 in his second match of Group Two. The three-day competition that got underway Thursday, doubles up as the 2019 World Table Tennis Championships (WTTC) qualifier. Mutua, who is competing in his first major international event, also lost to seventh seeded Saheed Idowu from Congo 3-1 sets of 11-8, 5-11, 3-11 and 6-11. The 42-year-old Thakkar, who is competing in her fifth WTTC qualifier, lost to Christy Bristol from Seychelles in 3-1 sets of 8-11, 11-9, 7-11 and 3-11. In her Group Two opening match, Thakkar lost to Katia Kessaci from Algeria in straight sets of 11-7, 11-4 and 11-3. Mutua rued the missed chances especially in the first two sets where he had cornered Ofon at 4-2 before the Cameroonian levelled at 5-5, 8-8, 11-11 and 12-12 to win the first set. “I am just disappointed since this is a match that I should have won, having rallied a bit late,” said Mutua. “I was just unlucky since I was keen but I believe he kept most of his balls on the table.” Mutua was due to later meet second seeded Aruna Quadri from Nigerian, who is ranked 20th in the world, in his last Group Two match. Top seeded Omar Assar beat Godfrey Sultan from Seychelles and South African Kurt Lingeveldt in identical sets of 3-0 to book his quarterfinal ticket. The quarterfinals are due for Friday.
