At least five children have been confirmed dead following a hand grenade explosion in South Sudan’s Imotong State near Torit town. Local State Security Advisor Joseph Oriho Abulemoi said the three boys and two girls were playing with the device when it went off. “One of them picked up the device and hit it on ground and it exploded, killing three children on spot and injuring two others who later died in hospital,” Dr Abulemoi explained. DEVICE He said the device had not been planted where the children were playing. “They found the device on the ground and did not know that it was dangerous, he said. The security advisor, however, said the authorities were investigating the incident. The world's youngest nation has been at war since 2013 hence the presence of weapons and explosive devices in several places. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011.
