Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna is calling for harsher punitive measures for drivers who cause accidents and fail to report them to the authorities. Speaking during a burial ceremony at Kairungu Location in his constituency, Mr Nguna said he will sponsor a Bill in Parliament which will seek to impose harsh punitive measures on reckless drivers who have been killing Kenyans on the roads. “I will table a Bill in Parliament in order to impose heavy punitive measures for reckless drivers. The country has so far lost too many people in road accidents caused by reckless drivers. Personally I’ve lost many of my friends. It’s now time to take action,” said Mr Nguna. FINE TOO LITLE The legislator said that currently, a hit-and-run driver is only fined not more than Sh300,000 and this, according to him, is too little compared to the magnitude of the offence committed. “In my Bill, I will seek to increase the penalty for hit-and-run drivers to up to Sh5 million fine or in default serve life imprisonment. This will instil sanity on our roads,” the MP said. He said that too many innocent Kenyans have lost their lives in road accidents and now is the right time to take stern action against reckless motorists. “We should do everything possible to ensure that careless drivers don’t continue with the killings on our roads. “The only way to achieve this is by imposing heavy fines on them so that they will always be careful when driving on the roads,” added the MP.
