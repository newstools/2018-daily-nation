Bungoma police are holding five male students who were found in a girls school. According to police, four students from St Mary’s Kibabii Boys High School and one from ACK Good Shepherd Secondary School sneaked into Cardinal Otunga Girls High School and hid in a dormitory. TESTS Bungoma South police boss David Kirui told Nation that the five were arrested after Cardinal Otunga Girls principal Emelda Oyombe reported that her students had gone on rampage over end of term tests. According to Mr Kirui, the boys were in girls’ pullovers and T-shirts. “We found the boys in the school compound. They are being held at Bungoma Police Station,” Mr Kirui said. “They will be released to their schools to be disciplined.” He added that investigations to establish what the boys were doing in a girls school at 3am had been launched. POOR GRADES The Cardinal Otunga Girls students had earlier claimed that Ms Oyombe had threatened to take unspecified action against anyone who scored below grade C in the examinations that were to begin Monday. “We believe that was the reason they went on rampage and destroyed school property,” Mr Kirui said. He, however, added that normality had resumed at the institution. The girls destroyed window panes, CCTV cameras and other property.
