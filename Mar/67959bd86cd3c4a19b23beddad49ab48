Education officers on Sunday evening closed Sagero Secondary School in Migori County and sent the students home following unrest. The students had gone on the rampage demanding the immediate removal of Principal Zachary Aludo. CLOSED The students claimed the school was being run down due to poor leadership. Education officers visited the school in Suna West and closed it to prevent damage of school property. "The officers have already launched their investigations into the claims...for now I will only say that," said Mr Aludo. The education officials declined to speak to journalists, saying they were not authorised to speak to the media. Sagero Secondary School was in the news last month after two teachers were arrested for beating and seriously injuring a Form Three student. The boy was rushed to Ojele Memorial Hospital in Migori Town and underwent a successful surgery to remove his spleen.
