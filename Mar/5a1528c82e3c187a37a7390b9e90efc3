Debate has been raging on whether the monopoly by Kenya Power in the distribution of electricity is good for consumers. This has been heightened by the Energy Regulatory Commission’s revelation this week that it is considering another firm’s application for a licence to not only generate, but also supply electricity to households and small-scale businesses. If licensed, PowerGen will be the third private utility to enter a market dominated by Kenya Power for decades. American firms Powerhive and Vulcan are already selling small-scale solar power to households through mini-grids. However, with more than six million subscribers, Kenya Power remains the principal supplier and seller of electricity, which it sources from KenGen and other independent power producers. OUTAGES Despite (or maybe due to) the monopoly, Kenya Power’s services are wanting. It has failed to connect millions of households to the national grid and exposes consumers to steep increases in power bills, not to mention the frequent outages blamed on its poor infrastructure. That the firm has just posted a 30 per cent — Sh2.9 billion — drop in net profit for the half-year ended December paints the picture of a public utility that has failed in a sector in which it plays against itself. Parliament should hasten the Energy Bill to streamline licensing of other electricity distributors and retailers.
