A youthful MCA from Embu County has used his Sh4.5 million car grant to purchase a fully equipped ambulance for his electorate in a bid to boost access to affordable healthcare. Kirimari Ward MCA Morris Collo Nyaga said he was touched by the plight of the residents, especially those living in informal settlements who cannot not afford an ambulance when they needed evacuation. Speaking in Embu Town Thursday afternoon, the first-time MCA who is in his late 20s said the ambulance will be parked at strategic places within Embu Town and will have a nurse and standby drivers. He said many residents are unable to access healthcare due to lack of an ambulance. “It is just six months since I was elected. I have not even purchased a new car. I had a blueprint and I want to transform it. I want everyone who cannot afford to hire an ambulance to access this one. It will have a designated area where it can be accessed,” said the MCA. He urged the county government to allocate money to Embu Town and separate funds for the rest of Manyatta Constituency, saying the town has unique challenges. Tens of his supporters, especially boda boda riders and small scale traders hailed the decision by the MCA to buy an ambulance. Mr Nyaga said he is already fundraising in order to purchase a fire fighting machine to help deal with constant fires.
