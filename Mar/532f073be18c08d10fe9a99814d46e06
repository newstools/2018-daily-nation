The meeting between Nasa leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta was an agreement between two individuals, coalition co-principal Musalia Mudavadi said Saturday. "The meeting was between two individuals and it does not bear the imprint of NASA Summit as it ought to be," he said. QUESTIONS Mr Mudavadi spoke at an ANC press conference in Mombasa. "For the record and on basis of the statement released, I can therefore categorically state that the meeting was between two individuals. "The question asked by our supporters is where the other three Nasa co-principals were. The answer is that we were neither aware, briefed, consulted nor invited. “This now leads to the second question: was the meeting a culmination of the dialogue Nasa has been agitating for? The answer is no," Mr Mudavadi said. NASA Mr Mudavadi said that the meeting between Mr Odinga and Mr Kenyatta was not discussed through the Nasa structures. "Indeed nowhere does the MoU allude to or mention Nasa, including the signing off. Instead, the two repeatedly invoked their names and personally committed to each other and not to all Kenyans," the ANC leader said. He was in Mombasa for a meeting with ANC leaders. Those in attendance included ANC national chairman Kelvin Lunani, Nambale MP Sakwa Bunyasi and his Sabatia counterpart Alfred Agoi. DEAL On Friday morning, Mr Odinga and Mr Kenyatta met at Harambee House in Nairobi. In a joint statement, they said they would work together in the best interest for Kenyans. Some leaders and citizens praised them and described them as statesmen for putting aside their differences and putting Kenyans’ interests before their own. However, others were sceptical of the agreement, while the three Nasa co-principals – Mr Mudavadi, Mr Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper and Mr Moses Wetang’ula of Ford Kenya – said they were unaware of the discussions.   They say they heard about it from the media.
