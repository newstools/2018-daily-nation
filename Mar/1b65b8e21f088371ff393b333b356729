More than 10,000 residents of Lamu East Sub-County now have access to clean water following with construction of a Sh20 million solar desalination plant at Siyu Village. The plant built by ENI Kenya B.V was established through partnership with the county government and the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum. It is expected to help end a decade-long shortage of water in Siyu and Pate Island. Although surrounded by the Indian Ocean, Siyu and Pate island dwellers have been struggling to find drinking water. HOUSES The plant will turn water from the Indian Ocean fresh. Addressing residents during the launch of the plant, Governor Fahim Twaha promised to have the area fenced.

It will cater for the needs of the thousands of locals who have been suffering,” Mr Twaha said. HAPPY Villagers could not hide their joy during the launch of the plant. Mr Mohamed Bakari said residents used to travel long distances to get water. “Our women are happy because they will not travel far to get water,” he said.
