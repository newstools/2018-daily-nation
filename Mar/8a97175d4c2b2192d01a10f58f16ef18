The National Assembly is this afternoon set to debate the pact between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition chief Raila Odinga— an agreement that has been praised by many but caused a rift in the National Super Alliance. Minority Leader John Mbadi on Wednesday morning notified the House of his intention to initiate debate on the motion which is listed as a “party-sponsored motion”, meaning it must be given priority. SUPPORT If MPs agree with the motion, the National Assembly will resolve to commend President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga, and commit to support and advance the aims and objectives of the initiative dubbed “Building Bridges to a new Kenyan Nation.” Below is the full text of the motion titled: bipartisan resolve to support the initiative on ‘building bridges to a new Kenyan nation’, anchor inclusivity & ensure cohesion in Kenya.
