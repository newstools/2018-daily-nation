The body of Justice Joseph Louis Onguto was flown to Kisumu on Friday morning for a final requiem mass ahead of his burial on Saturday. The body arrived at the Kisumu International Airport at around 10.30am and was transported St Peters Clavers Church in Yala where the mass will be held at noon. Thereafter, he will be taken to his ancestral home in Dudi village, North Gem, Siaya County for an overnight vigil. Following his unexpected death, judges in Nairobi and Kisumu held commemorative events on separate days in his memory. Some courts in Milimani, Nairobi, where he worked last will not be sitting Friday in his honour. Justice Onguto collapsed and died after a gym session at Parklands Sports Club in Nairobi and was pronounced dead at MP Shah Hospital on February 28. In his tribute, Justice Mwongo described the late judge as a friendly person who detested wrong doing wherever it manifested itself and one who plainly spoke against public lack of integrity. “He was always concerned about the day to day welfare of his colleagues and made it his business to vocally follow up on issues he felt were injustices,” said Justice Mwongo. Outgoing Attorney-General Githu Muigai mourned him as an inspiring, morally upright person and a personal friend. While the Chief Justice David Maraga mourned him as ‘humble and brilliant legal mind’ who served Kenyans with distinction and commitment. President Uhuru Kenyatta described him as a person who was devoted to dispensing justice without fear or favour. He will be laid to rest tomorrow (Saturday).   He will be buried on Saturday 24 in Dudi village in Yala, Siaya County.
