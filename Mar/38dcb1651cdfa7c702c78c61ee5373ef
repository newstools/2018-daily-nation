A law graduate has filed a petition at the High Court challenging the decision by the Kenya School of Law (KSL) to reject his application for enrolment at the advocate training programme. In his court pleadings, Sydney Douglas Webuye, University of Nairobi graduate, stated that KSL did not admit him for the 2018/2019 academic year and instead invited him for the pre-bar examination. LAW KLC wanted to subject him to pre-bar examination on grounds that he a scored C plain instead of the minimum stipulated grade of C+ (plus) as per Kenya School of Law Act 2012, Mr Webuye said. In his argument, he said the act was not in force when he was admitted to study law at the University of Nairobi and that he had legitimate expectation that the law will not be applicable to continuing law students. He argued that it was during the course of his studies that the Parliament amended the Legal Education Act 2009 to limit admission to holders of diploma in law at KSL. He wants the court to grant him a conservatory order staying the law school decision to decline him direct admission, a decision he termed as unreasonable and illegal The matter filed through Onindo Onindo and Associate Advocates was certified as urgent.
