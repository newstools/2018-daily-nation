The performance of local professional golfers is wanting, with only two out of 22 making the cut in this year’s Barclays Kenya Open at Nairobi’s Muthaiga Golf Club. Rizwan Charania finished 69th, as the Kenyans once again staged a poor show. Italian Lorenzo Gagli beat Swede Jens Fahrbring in a three-hole play-off to win the trophy. The organisers’ incentive of Sh100,000 to any Kenyan making the cut and Sh500,000 for finishing in the top 10 seems not to have worked. While it’s back to the drawing board, both the amateurs, professionals and Kenya Open Golf Limited know what should be done to improve the standards of the sport. REVAMPEuropean Challenge Tour director Alain de Soultrait is perturbed that the local professionals are not growing in the game despite the Kenya Open growing in statue. This year’s event had an improved prize kitty of Sh62.5 million, making it the most lucrative on the European Challenge Tour. The winner pocketed Sh11.5 million. Young Kenyan golfers have nothing to play for and look forward to, especially with a few events for the professionals. It is high time the professional game, which has been ignored, was prioritised. The professionals need at least one major event monthly, if they are to compete effectively with their well-prepared rivals mainly from Europe. This will give up-and-coming golfers hope.
