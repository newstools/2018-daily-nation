Champions Vihiga Queens visit Mathare United at Camp Toyoyo grounds in the Women Premier League this weekend. Queens, unbeaten in their opening three matches, face a team ranked sixth on the 16-team table with seven points accumulated from two wins, a draw and a loss, in one of the two games slated for Saturday. The Alex Alumira-led Vihiga are three points adrift of leaders Thika Queens who have played one more match. Another encounter will see seventh placed Palos Ladies entertain ninth placed Eldoret Falcons at Kisumu Polytechnic. On Sunday, leaders Thika Queens will once again rely on goal poacher Mwanahalima Adam when they host third placed Makolanders in Thika. The teams were handed a major financial boost on Thursday when the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) released a Sh12 million grant that will see each of the 16 teams pocket Sh750,000 per annum.
