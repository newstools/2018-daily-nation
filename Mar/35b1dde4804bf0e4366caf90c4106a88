At least three people were killed and two are missing after they were swept away by floodwaters on Friday evening in Samburu East. The two missing men are feared dead. SWEPT AWAY Waso and Sereolipi Assistant County Commissioner Kimani Maina said two bodies were retrieved on Friday night and taken to Isiolo Hospital mortuary. One more body was retrieved on Saturday afternoon. The other two were yet to be found. Mr Maina added that they could have been trapped under their vehicle. The victims, all from Isiolo, were said to have been loading sand into the vehicle when they were swept away. “Police officers have been dispatched to the area. Due to network challenges in the area, I haven’t received updates from the officers,” said Mr Maina. Heavy rain has caused flash floods in many areas, leaving behind a trail of destruction in Isiolo. FLOODS At least 40 people have lost their household items in Isiolo Town after floodwaters swept away their property. Isiolo Deputy Governor Ibrahim Issa feared that more property could be lost if it continues raining heavily. He said the county administration had set aside a funds for disaster response, but he did not state how much was set aside. The Kenya Red Cross Society distributed food and non-food items to 22 residents whose houses were submerged in Kulamawe. PLAN The deputy governor urged residents to be vigilant and asked those whose houses are along water paths to relocate to safer grounds. The administration, he said, would look into the town plan to mitigate such disasters in future. “There is poor planning in town, people are constructing buildings along water paths hence diverting the floodwaters into residential houses,” he said. On Thursday, one person was killed in Isiolo after he was swept away while crossing over a culvert in Soko Mjinga area.   They tried to cross River Enziu with their lorry but the water carried them away.
