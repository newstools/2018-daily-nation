In less than two weeks, the first batch of Team Kenya to the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games leaves the country for the premier event in Australia, where Kenya will be represented in 16 disciplines. But things haven’t been easy for the team, with the funds from the government for the “Club” Games set for April 4 to 15 having been delayed. By Sunday, the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Noc-K) had not received the cash they require despite the teams having gone into residential training camp last week. Teams are now seeking alternatives in terms of facilities since Kasarani and Nyayo stadiums are undergoing renovations. That has hampered planning. The Gold Coast games are quite vital for Kenya, especially with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics beckoning. It’s important for the government to take sports more seriously by investing in modern infrastructure, if the country is to continue performing well globally. It’s shameful that our sportsmen and women are taken round in circles despite the sacrifices they make. This year’s Commonwealth Games should not have been an afterthought for the government, especially with a Sports ministry that is expected to be vibrant, having been aware of the competition since five years ago. We hope Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa will rise to the occasion and put sports on the right track.
