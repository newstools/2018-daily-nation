The motorbike taxis, popularly known as boda boda, are increasingly playing a vital role in public transportation. Even in towns, where the main mode of passenger transport is the matatu, many people still rely on the motorbike riders. In the rural areas, boda boda have become the most reliable form of transport. However, this transport sub-sector is also quite chaotic, as it is largely unlicensed and not properly regulated. One just needs to buy a motorbike and, after a few lessons, his rider will be carrying passengers, exposing them to grave danger. TRAFFIC RULES The boda boda has, in fact, become synonymous with lawlessness. The riders flout traffic rules with impunity, they care less about their own safety and that of their passengers. As a result, hospitals are today full of victims of boda boda accidents, as the death toll increases. The riders have also lately been attacked by thieves targeting their bikes. CRIME There are numerous reports from across the country of spiralling violence targeting or involving boda boda operators. The motorbikes are also used by criminals to quickly get away from scenes of crime. True, this informal transport sub-sector is a source of employment and a decent livelihood for many youth. However, left on its own, its adverse effects are bound to outweigh its usefulness. There is a need, therefore, to enhance the security and safety of the riders, their passengers and their machines, but also streamline the service. Unfortunately, to traffic police, who should play a key role here, this is a veritable cash cow.
