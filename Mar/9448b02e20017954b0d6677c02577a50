A-29-year old man is being held at Rangwe Police Station in Homa Bay County on suspicion of killing his estranged wife. Police said the man chopped off the woman’s hand and left her for dead before dousing the body with acid. The two, who separated two months ago, hailed from Kagan West Location. According to Kanyiriema Assistant Chief Amos Okoth, the family of the suspect engineered the separation because she was older than him. "Their age difference was one reason for the misunderstanding," Mr Okoth said. MISSING The assistant chief said the woman got married in the next village after the separation. He added that her new husband reported her missing on Thursday afternoon. "He said the woman had been missing for four days," the chief said. The woman’s body was later found in a bush within the village. Mr Okoth said she could have been killed elsewhere. "She must have died from bleeding after her arm was cut off. The body had acid burns," he said. Police took the body to Rangwe Hospital mortuary.
