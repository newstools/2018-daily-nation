President Uhuru Kenyatta Wednesday morning travelled to Rwanda, where he will join other African leaders in the signing of an agreement that will create a continental free trade area. The Heads of State will gather in Kigali to sign the African Continental Free Trade Area which is expected to increase intra-Africa trade above its current low level. The trade pact is expected to spur economic growth, industrialisation, improved infrastructure development and business diversification. The trade agreement also deals with non-tariff barriers, technical obstacles to trade and customs procedures. The agreement also creates a framework to deal with transit issues between countries. The plane carrying the President departed from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport shortly before 8am.
