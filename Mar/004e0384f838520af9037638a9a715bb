Striking university staff have been offered Sh6.8 billion by their employer. Vice-Chancellors Committee Chairman Francis Aduol told National Assembly’s Education Committee Tuesday that the money, which is subject to the Ministry of Education’s approval, would be used to pay salaries and house allowances for staff, including lecturers, for the financial year 2017/2018. “We will work on the budget for subsequent years as we go along. It is significant to note that the projected figure is reasonable, considering that the Ministry of Education paid into the Financial Year 2017-2018 Sh5.2 billion as a top-up in capitation to cater for the increase in salaries from the 2013-2017 CBAs,” Prof Aduol told the House committee Tuesday. However, Prof Aduol said that vice-chancellors were still waiting for the proposal’s approval by the Ministry of Education before they could table it before lecturers in a bid to end the strike. Earlier, Universities Academic Staff Union Secretary-General Constantine Wasonga told the House committee that they needed Sh38 billion, which translates to Sh9.8 billion per year, for the four-year deal. There is a total of 27,000 staff in public universities including 9,000 lectures. Prof Aduol told the committee that most universities were unable to pay statutory deductions while some, even with capitation they received from the government, could not pay salaries. “More than 50 per cent of universities cannot meet the cost of basic salaries of their staff,” said Prof Aduol.
