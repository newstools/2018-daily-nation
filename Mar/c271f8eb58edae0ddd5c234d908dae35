Grief has engulfed Kanthitu Village in Makueni County following a grisly road crash on Friday night which claimed the lives of two members of AIC Kanthitu choir. The crash, which happened at Muliilii along the Wote-Makindu road, involved a lorry and a 14-seater matatu that was transporting the choir members from Makindu Town where they had spent the day recording their music. Fourteen choir members were injured, five of them seriously, and were rushed to Makindu Sub-County Hospital for treatment. "We have lost two members of our choir, two women who sang in alto voice," Mr Julius Kamukwa, one of the survivors, told Daily Nation at the hospital. According to Mr Kamukwa, the matatu rammed into the lorry that it was trying to overtake. While confirming the incident, Makueni County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim said the matatu hit a stalled lorry from behind. The two bodies were taken to Makindu Hospital mortuary.< Moi University win inaugural Koitalel Rugby Series held in Nandi Gor Mahia play away to Esperance in CAF Champions League 2nd leg 1st round West Pokot county rolls out Ksh. 20 million to fight drought Stakeholders call for reinstatement of sacked KFS officials Ganze residents want deadly dam fenced or completely closed
