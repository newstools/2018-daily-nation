Kenya’s national junior team is all set to tackle the rest of Africa, in this year’s All Africa Junior Golf Championship to be held at Royal Dar es Salaam Golf course in Casablanca Morocco from Sunday. The team of four boys and three girls fly out Saturday morning after weeks of training at Muthaiga Golf Club. The boys coach John van Liefland, who is also the national coach, said the golfers had responded well to the training programme but as to how they will perform, it is a matter of wait and see. “Its difficult to predict how one will perform. You can probably predict the progress after the first round’’ he said, picking out new-comer Daniel Kiragu who was impressive in training. He said the other three players namely Zubair Khan, Mutahi Kibugu, and Agil Is-Haq have been in the team before and that he expect them to play well. This year, 18 countries are expected to participate in the one-week long championship whose 2017 edition was held at Royal Harare Golf Club where Kenya finished in sixth place — the girls team was third. Of the three girls, Kellie Gachaga, who is a former Kenya ladies champion, has been training in Dubai where her parents are based and will join the team in Casablanca. The others are Ashley Awour and Channelle Wangari.   President Kenyatta congratulated the Casablanca-bound team.
