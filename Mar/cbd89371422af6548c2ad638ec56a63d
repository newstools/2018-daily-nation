Three schoolgirls drowned Tuesday evening, after they were swept by flood water as they crossed Kiruri seasonal river in Kiambere, Embu County. The nursery class pupils at Karura Primary School were in a group of five when they attempted to cross the river which had swollen due to ongoing heavy rains. Leonard Mwaniki, an MCA in the country, said two other girls were rescued by members of public. The survivors were taken to Embu Level Five Hospital. Mr Mwaniki called on school administrators not to allow children to go home when it is raining. He also appealed to parents to escort pupils to school and collect them from the learning institutions during this rainy period to avoid such tragedies.
