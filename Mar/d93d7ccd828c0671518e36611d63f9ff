The Court of Appeal has ordered the High Court to hear afresh the petition filed by Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua challenging the election of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru. Judges Mohamed Warsame, Daniel Musinga and Otieno Odek set aside the striking out Ms Karua’s petition and ordered a fresh hearing by Justice Lucy Gitari. The judges faulted Justice Gitari of Kerugoya High Court for dismissing the case despite the petition raising weighty issues. DISPUTES The judgment, read by Justice Warsame, also found Justice Gitari failed to appreciate the role of courts in considering disputes irrespective of whether issues raised were insignificant or not. The judges observed that Ms Karua raised serious allegations that required the judge to investigate and determine instead of prematurely striking out the petition. Ms Karua's case was thrown out despite conclusion of pre-trial and fixing of a hearing date. “We are satisfied that the learned judge did not exercise her discretion properly. It is incumbent upon the court to address the substantive raised by the appellant,”  the judges said. The judges also agreed with Ms Karua that Judge Gitari unfairly dismissed her petition on technicalities after she ruled that the petition omitted the election results and dates declared in her petition. They observed that striking out the petition on such ground without examining other fundamental aspects of the case was tantamount to miscarriage of justice. The court also set aside Sh10 million that the court slapped on Ms Karua saying it was excessive and form of punishment to deter Kenyans from accessing court justice. It awarded Ms Karua Sh2 million as cost of appeal.   High Court says Karua failed to comply with election petition rules.
