Two men were Monday arraigned before the Bungoma High Court over the killings and unrest in Mt Elgon region. Mr Alex Juma and Mr Cleophas Sichei were taken to court amid tight security by officers attached to the criminal investigations department. Mr Juma is said to have been arrested in Uganda while on the run. However, the two did not take plea because the prosecution asked the court for more time to conclude their investigations. RAPE CHARGES Prosecutor Monica Nyakiba said they intended to charge the two with murder, robbery with violence, rape, malicious destruction of property and causing grievous harm. “These are people with no fix aboard and should not be given bond. They have been on the run and we will require more time,” said Ms Nyakiba. Mr Juma and Mr Sichei objected the move, saying they were already in court and were ready to proceed with the case. The court directed that they be remanded at Bungoma GK prisons until March 19 as police continue with the investigations. Police said the key suspect, Mr Timothy Kiptanui Kitai alias Cheparkach, is on the run after a Sh1 million bounty was placed on his head.
