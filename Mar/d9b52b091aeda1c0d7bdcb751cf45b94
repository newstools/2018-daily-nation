Voting in Kitui West by-election kicked off at 6am Monday amid low voter turnout attributed to a heavy downpour Sunday night. By 7am, only a few people had turned up in most polling centres with the number of those who had voted ranging between five and 10. CANDIDATES Most candidates had, however, cast their votes by midday. Wiper party candidate Edith Nyenze cast her vote at Kyondoni Primary School at 9.30am, while Mutiso Leli of Narc-Kenya voted at 8am at Matinyani AIC Day Secondary School. Dr Fridah Mutui of Kenya Social Congress cast her vote at 8.30am at Kikanga Primary School. The other two candidates, Dennis Muli Mulws (Independent) and Elijah Kilonzi of Chama cha Uzalendo, were expected to vote by noon. Addressing the press after casting her vote, Ms Nyenze said she is confident of clinching the seat. She expressed confidence in the process, saying the IEBC is undertaking its work process with diligence. "I am confident of winning the seat as the people of Kitui West have faith in my leadership abilities,” said Mrs Nyenze. She said if she loses, she is willing to work with the winner to serve the people of Kitui West. However, Mutiso Leli of Narc-Kenya has cast doubt in the process, saying some of his agents had at first been barred from entering polling centres. "The process is going on well, but I wonder why most of my agents were barred from entering polling stations. This is unacceptable," said Mr Leli. Mr Leli said despite the Wiper machinery having camped in the constituency for the past one month, he will emerge victorious. He said what people of Kitui West are looking for is a leader who can deliver and they won’t just be casting their votes out of sympathy.   She garnered 13, 388 votes and her sole rival Kitili Maluki Mwendwa got 2,663 votes.
