Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said that he is not worried by National Super Alliance leader Raila Odinga’s meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday. During a funeral ceremony in Mua Hills, Machakos, on Saturday, Mr Musyoka said his heart was at peace while his lieutenants criticised Mr Odinga "for betraying his longtime allies". SELF-CENTREDNESS “We have agreed to meet as Nasa on Monday and know what exactly happened, but my heart is at peace. I feel vindicated. What I have been preaching will happen,” Mr Musyoka said. Mavoko MP Patrick Makau condemned Mr Odinga, accusing him of betraying Mr Musyoka, "who has stood with him in the last two elections". Mr Makau said the meeting between Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga showed their self-centredness against the cause of justice. MAIMED “Kenya is for everyone not the two individuals,” said Mr Makau. “Kenyans died because of this cause. Kenyans were maimed because of this cause and for what end, 10 per cent? Mr Kalonzo, the field is now open. We now give you authority to go meet Ruto, Gideon and any other leaders.” BRAINCHILD The Mavoko lawmaker said Mr Odinga’s "betrayal" opened room for the community to seek alliances with other leaders to chart its destiny. Former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti said Mr Musyoka was the brainchild of the push for dialogue. She added that bloodletting would have been avoided if President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga had heeded Mr Musyoka’s calls for dialogue early enough. “I wish Raila and Uhuru heeded our party leader’s calls for dialogue. We would have averted unnecessary deaths,” she said.
