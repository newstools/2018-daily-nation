The Kenya Forest Service (KFS) and police have impounded an Administration Police lorry ferrying 120 bags of charcoal in Kilifi County. Malindi KFS base commander Harrison Afuata said they stopped the lorry following reports from Magarini Charcoal Producers Association that a police lorry was being used to ferry charcoal to evade roadblocks. IMPOUNDED Speaking to the Nation on the phone, he said the lorry was travelling from Tana River and it was stopped at Gede along the Malindi-Kilifi highway on Friday night. “We are investigating a woman known as Mama Mercy said to be behind the syndicate and has resorted to using police vehicles to transport charcoal even after we began a crackdown on the illegal business,” he said. Mr Afuata said officers from Magarini Sub-County where the lorry was impounded are investigating the matter. The suspects are said to be on the run. Sources at Magarini told the Nation that the charcoal belongs to a notorious charcoal dealer who is wanted for illegal trade in Tana River, Kilifi and Lamu counties. This comes barely two weeks after the KFS impounded three buses at Magarini that were ferrying 95 bags of charcoal and arrested the drivers and conductors.
