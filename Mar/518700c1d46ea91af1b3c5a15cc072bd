Police have arrested two suspects in Busia town for being in possession of a revolver gun. Busia OCPD Masai Makau said his officers were tipped off by members of the public after a scuffle ensued between the two – yet to be identified lovers – at their Legio Maria estate home where gun shots were fired on Wednesday. The police boss added preliminary investigations revealed the incident could have been fueled by domestic dispute. The female suspect, who had the gun concealed in her purse, arrived from her Marachi estate, also within town, early in the afternoon and attacked her companion for harassing her. GUN SHOTS Upon searching their house, police found three rounds of ammunition. “The two are in custody to help us with investigations. Members of the public informed my officers that they heard gun shots, which the two denied, prompting a search of the house where they found a revolver gun, three rounds of ammunition and a spent cartridge,” he said adding that no one was injured during the incident. ATTEMPTED MURDER“The two, aged between 23 and 26 years, will be charged with possession of a firearm without licence and attempted murder.”Mr Makau commended members of the public for their efforts to bring perpetrators to justice and thanked the community members who reported the criminals.“We ask those possessing firearms illegally to surrender them before we catch up with them.”
