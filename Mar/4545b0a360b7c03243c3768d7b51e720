Kenya Prisons got their 2018 men's African Volleyball Club Championship campaign off to a winning start after beating Lesotho's Redskin 3-0 sets at Ahly Hall in Cairo, Egypt. The Kenyan warders won 25-15, 25-14 and 25-22 in their opening pool A match on Tuesday. Prisons had it easy in the first and second sets, but the third set was a tough one as the Basotho pushed back and led 17-15 at one point. The tactical wits, discipline and shrewdness of Paul Muthinja’s boys, together with the experience of Elphas Makuto, Sila Kipruto and Rodgers Kipkirui ensured Prisons' carried the day, as they scored eight points in quick succession to end up tying up the set albeit by a slim 25-22 victory. Prisons are in a tough pool alongside defending champions and record winners Al Ahly of Egypt, Police of Cote d’Ivoire, Congo’s Espoir, Nemostar of Uganda and Redskins of Lesotho. They face Espoir on Wednesday evening in their next match. GSU, who are Kenya’s other representatives in the competition, are scheduled to play Algeria’s Olympique in their opening pool D match at 8pm Tuesday. The Kenyan champions, who are returning to the continental competition after missing last year’s edition in Tunisia, are in pool D together with Cameroon’s Port, Algeria’s Olympique, Kampala Amateurs of Uganda, hosts Elguish and Ethiopia’s Wollaitta. “The boys and I are determined to perform well in Cairo, and it is not impossible. There is a lot of stiff completion at this stage but I believe we can do it. Most of these players missed the competition last year so this time they are eager to give a good account of themselves,” GSU coach Gideon Tarus said on Monday. The men’s tournament comes just a week after the women’s edition, which was played at the same venue, where hosts Al Ahly reclaimed their title after trouncing Carthage of Tunisia by straight sets. Kenya Pipeline finished third after edging domestic rivals Kenya Prisons in the third place playoffs.
