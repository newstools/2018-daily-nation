Former Kenyan international Kennedy Obuya has called for a review of Cricket Kenya’s constitution to take care of all stakeholders. Speaking on Saturday, Obuya, who is also a founder member of Obuya Academy team, said that a new all-inclusive constitution would help revive Kenyan cricket. Obuya said: “The current constitution of Cricket Kenya only carters for established clubs that have formed associations like Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA), Coast Cricket Association (CCA) and Rift Valley Cricket Association (RVCA) as its affiliates. We would like to see a new constitution that will take care the interests of former international players, schools and colleges which nurture local talent.” Obuya also said a caretaker committee to run Kenyan cricket following the resignation of CK chairlady Jackie Janmohamed, should be formed. Obuya also decried the exclusion of Obuya Academy from taking part in NPCA Council Meeting even though the team has met all the requirements set by NPCA. The Obuya Academy is one of the 10 teams in the NPCA super league. “We have written three times to NPCA seeking explanation as to why we could not participate in their Council Meeting, but it has been all in vain. We have not received any reply." On the future of cricket in the country, Obuya said: “With proper development structures like having aging group teams from under-11 to under-17, our game will bounce back to where we were in 2003." “But this will only happen if we have good leadership at the helm of CK."   Kaul is the only other elected CK board member who has not yet resigned.
