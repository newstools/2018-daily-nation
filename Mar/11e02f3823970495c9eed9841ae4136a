Police in Uasin Gishu County have arrested a man suspected to have killed his four-month-old baby after a quarrel with his wife. The 40-year-old Moiben area resident is believed to have locked the baby in a cupboard for four days. The decomposing body was found by neighbours on Friday following a pungent smell that was emanating from the house. Eldoret East OCPD Richard Omanga said the man separated with his wife a week ago. He added that the suspect would be arraigned for murder this week when investigations are complete. Neighbours said the couple had been quarrelling before the woman disappeared.
