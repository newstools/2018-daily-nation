The Jubilee candidate who lost in the Nyamira governorship election has filed an appeal in Kisumu seeking to overturn a High Court ruling the upheld Mr John Nyagarama's win. Mr Walter Nyambati, accompanied by his lawyer Osoro Mogikoyo, on Monday filed huge volumes of documents at the Court of Appeal in Kisumu. EVIDENCE It is his second attempt to overturn Mr Nyagarama’s win after Judge James Makau quashed the petition filed at the High Court on February 27. In his judgement, the judge ruled that Mr Nyambati failed to prove allegations. Judge Makau stated that the irregularities found during the scrutiny were insufficient to invalidate Mr Nyagarama's victory. But in his appeal, Mr Nyambati says Judge Makau failed to consider the evidence adduced before him. “There were many illegalities which the judge overlooked. That is why we have come here to seek justice,” said Mr Nyambati. He has added three more lawyers to his legal team to ensure he wins the appeal. “This is an appeal that will succeed. It’s a total of 81 records of appeal rich in evidence. We are going to demonstrate that the judge in Nyamira was very unfair,” said Mr Nyambati. They will be coming to take a hearing date during the pre-trial hearing on April 11. In the poll, Mr Nyagarama won with 65,161 votes against 58,936 votes garnered by Mr Nyambati.   There were claims of errors made when results were being transposed from Form 37A to Forms 37B and 37C.
