A Nairobi County security officer has been fined Sh200,000 by a Milimani court for soliciting a bribe. Senior principal magistrate Lawrence Mugambi ordered that he serve a one-year jail term if he does not pay the fine. BRIBE Mr Christopher Njenga Kamau was found guilty of demanding and receiving a bribe of Sh5,000, to facilitate the release of a motorcycle belonging to Mr George Odhiambo Owuor. The court heard that the officer, a county askari, demanded the bribe after Mr Owuorâ€™s motorcycle was impounded on November 19, 2014. Officers from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) received a report from Mr Owuor, the proprietor of Quick Data Carrier Services. Mr Owuor said he had sent an employee to make deliveries within the City Centre but the man was arrested by county government officers for allegedly flouting by-laws. IMPOUNDED The county official impounded the motorcycle and demanded a bribe of Sh15,000, which he later increased to Sh17,000. But much later, he reduced the demand to Sh5,000. EACC detectives laid a trap for him and recorded him demanding the bribe. On November 26, 2014, the complainant was then given Sh5,000 treated money and escorted by investigators to meet the suspect. The suspect met the complainant outside City Hall, received the money, and was immediately arrested. Mr Kamau was charged with three counts of soliciting and receiving a benefit.
