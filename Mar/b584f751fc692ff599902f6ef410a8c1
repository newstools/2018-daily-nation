Parliament has directed Auditor-General Edward Ouko to look into Sh2.8 billion paid by the National Land Commission as compensation for the Standard Gauge Railway land. National Assembly Public Accounts Committee chairman Opiyo Wandayi on Tuesday said Mr Ouko would submit the report to the panel in 60 days. DOCUMENTS The auditor is required to find out if the commission ascertained the parcel numbers, precise acreage and confirmed the accuracy of values before approving payments. The House committee also wants to know if the acquisition of the land was necessary. The investigation follows reports that NLC over-compensated some landowners. There are also reports of multiple compensations and false claims. The inquiry was ordered when the commission failed to respond appropriately to questions raised by the auditor general and providing supporting documents in relation to the Sh2.8 billion paid as compensation to landowners. The queries relate to the 2015/16 financial year.   He says infrastructure development will boost tourism.
