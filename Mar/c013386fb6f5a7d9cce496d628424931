Stanlib Fahari I-Reit chief executive Kenneth Masika on Thursday told investors the unit has identified another suitable property and entered into a binding agreement for purchase at Sh850 million. This is subject to Capital Markets Authority (CMA) and unit holders approvals. The new acquisition is a Grade A low rise office in Lavington’s Gitanga Road, from which the management expects a first-year income generation of about Sh73.8 million with an escalation of 15 per cent every two years. “The Reit has also engaged in various activities to improve its portfolio by enhancing the tenant mix, attracting and retaining good quality tenants. “To this end, the Reit has identified a cinema operator who is expected to start operations in quarter four of 2018 from its largest asset – Greenspan Mall. The Reit will incur just under Sh40 million to modify the identified unit to suit the intended user,” said Mr Masika.
