More than 130 people were arrested on Sunday for having fake admission letters to join the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) training school. They had reported to the Recruit Training School (RTS) in Eldoret. CONNED During the certificate verification process, KDF officers found that the 132 had fake letters. Brigadier Martin Ong’oyi, who led the vetting at the school, said the youth were handed over to police officers from Eldoret. Mr Ong’oyi said it was shocking to see more Kenyans being conned by people who masquerade as KDF recruiting officers. “Since recruitment of KDF officers started this year there was intensive campaigns to caution Kenyans against conmen who claim to be in a position to offer training opportunities at RTS. “It is unfortunate that such a huge number of young Kenyans have been conned,” he said. CAUTION Brigadier Ong’oyi said that the number of recruits with fake letters has doubled this year. Last year 65 youth were arrested with fake calling letters. Brigadier Ong’oyi urged police to investigate the matter and bring to book the conmen to save Kenyans from being swindled. He said the conmen collect between Sh50,000 and Sh250,000 from each person they give admission letters. The arrested youth were taken into custody at Eldoret West, Soy and Railways police stations. They will be taken to court on Monday to answer charges of using fake admission documents to join RTS.
