Twenty-seven people have been arrested in Kakamega Town following Friday’s running battles with police during the funeral procession of a murdered girl. Chaos erupted in the town when Sharlyne Mwanzia’s body was being taken from the mortuary to Scheme Estate where the family lives. Teargas and gunshots rent the air as youth demanded the arrest of the murder suspect. ARREST Kakamega police boss Joseph Chebii on Saturday confirmed the arrest of 27 suspects and said they would be arraigned in court on Monday. He, however, dismissed reports that some youth were shot on Friday. “There is no report that has reached our desk until now that a person got injured during the running battles that we experienced yesterday (Friday). INJURED “However, two police officers sustained minor injuries when the angry mourners pelted them with stones,” Mr Chebii said. He urged members of the public to avoid confronting law enforcement officers. Mr Chebii said they want the suspects to give them more information to lead to the arrest of more perpetrators of the chaos. He condemned attacks on police officers. MURDERED Emotions ran high on Friday as mourners wailed and condemned the brutal murder of nine-year-old Sharlyne. The girl was murdered and her body dumped in a water tank. Sharlyne, who was a Standard Three pupil at St Joseph’s Academy, went missing from her parent’s home on March 11, 2018 as she played with her brothers. Her body was found on March 16.
