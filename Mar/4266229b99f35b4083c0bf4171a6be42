Police in Mombasa have killed a notorious gangster after a gang raided a home belonging to a former police boss and stole jewellery worth Sh2 million. The suspect, identified as Zakayo Ogode, was killed at his hideout in Ziwa la Ng’ombe in Nyali Constituency. A contingent of police officers raided his house where he was shot dead. The officers recovered a Ceska pistol and 45 bullets. Two toy pistols and four smartphones were also recovered from the house according to Mombasa Police Commander Johnston Ipara who addressed journalists at Kisauni Dog Section. Ogode’s gang is said to have been terrorising residents of Nyali suburbs. An eyewitness said the more than 15 officers, both in uniform and in civilian clothing, arrived at the suspect’s house and gunshots were heard after some minutes. GUNSHOTS “They got in and after some minutes we heard some gunshots after which we were asked to move far away from the house,” said an eyewitness who identified himself as Martin. Police said they have been pursuing the thug for the last one week. “This is a criminal who has been terrorising residents. Early today morning he raided a house together with his two accomplices and robbed a family of their items at a house in Nyali,” said Mr Ipara adding that he was shot after he pulled out the Ceska pistol that he was armed with. Police sources revealed that the gangster had raided a house of a former senior police officer and robbed his wife of her gold jewelleries.
