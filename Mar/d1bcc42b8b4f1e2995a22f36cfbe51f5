The first lot of the “Team Kenya” contingent to the Commonwealth Games landed in Gold Coast, Australia, Monday morning in high spirits with just a week remaining for the big show to hit the road. Members of the boxing, triathlon, cycling and weightlifting teams, along with the medical team, landed in Brisbane in the early hours of Monday and took the one-long bus ride to Gold Coast. “We welcomed them at the airport and they travelled without a hitch,” said Barnabas Korir, Kenya’s head of delegation to the games. “We had arranged for them, through Kenya Airways, to take a nap at a hotel in Bangkok while waiting for their connecting flight to Brisbane,” he added. Another group of mainly officials and support staff left Nairobi on Sunday night and are expected in Gold Coast Tuesday morning.   “They also have a layover in Bangkok,” Korir chipped in. National Olympic Committee of Kenya President Paul Tergat, secretary Francis Paul, along with Vice-President Waithaka Kioni were expected to travel Monday night with a group of 23 athletes leaving Nairobi on Friday and another group on Saturday. Further groups will leave Nairobi on Sunday, with 17 athletes, whose programmes start much later, travelling along with their coaches on April 8.   The Gold Coast Commonwealth Games will run from April 4 to 15 with the track and field programme starting on April 8 and sevens rugby on April 13. The late departures will include the marathon and 10,000 metres runners along with world 5,000 metres champion Hellen Obiri. “So far everything is fine here and the reception has been good. We have put everything in place and all is smooth,” Korir, who is also Athletics Kenya’s Nairobi Branch chairman said.
