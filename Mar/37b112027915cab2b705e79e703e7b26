Police gunned down three suspected gangsters who kidnapped a lawyer in Murang’a Town on Saturday night. Murang’a East DCIO Japheth Maingi said three other gangsters escaped during the shoot-out. SHOOT-OUT The suspects kidnapped the lawyer at 8.30pm near his home and fled using the Murang'a-Sagana road. Police pursued. "They [the suspects] had warned the advocate that they would pay him a visit and this prompted us to keep tracing their numbers. We had discovered they were in town and kept an eye on the advocate. "Just at Mathioya River, the gangsters stopped their cars and started changing their cars and number plates when we intercepted them and ordered them to surrender," the DCIO told the Nation. The criminals defied the orders and opened fire and police officers fired back, killing three suspects at about 9.30pm, he said. Three suspects escaped on foot and the lawyer was rescued. MANHUNT According to the DCIO, police recovered an AK47, a toy pistol and the two motor vehicles the suspects were using. He said they have launched a manhunt for the three who escaped on foot carrying a bag that police suspect could have contained more weapons. Mr Maingi urged members of the public to volunteer information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects. He said they are yet to ascertain the motive of the kidnapping. PROBE The lawyer was not injured during the incident and he is helping the police with investigations, Mr Maingi said, noting that this was not the first time the lawyer has been kidnapped. "He was kidnapped sometime last year and he seems to have issues with one person who has been sending unknown people to him with an aim of hurting him. “There seems to be more than meet the eye and we shall leave no stone unturned to establish the truth," the DCIO said.
