A film workshop for teachers which was held at the Tom Mboya Labour College last week was greeted with a lot of excitement. The teachers were divided into three groups that were oriented to the concepts creation, production and post-production. The sessions which were practical were facilitated by Prof Jane Plastow of African Theatre University of Leeds, Prof Paul Cooke of World Cinema University of Leeds, Dr Kimingichi Wabende and Dr Symon Peter Otieno both of the university of Nairobi. The teachers were from all the regions in the country. HANDS-ON TRAINING This was the first hands-on training in all aspects of film training for teachers. Dr Otieno said they were introducing hands-on training for teachers in all aspects of film. The training targeted drama and film teachers from Kenyan schools and colleges. Talented school teachers who have shined in the Kenya National Drama Festivals by producing full feature films or short films were invited for the training which started on Wednesday and ends this Sunday.   PROFESSIONAL SKILLS The facilitators offered professional skills to film and drama teachers from primary and secondary schools and teachers training colleges with no previous practical training on film production. ‘’With more training we will raise the standards in local film production, says Dr Otieno. Kenya National Drama Festival chairman Chokera Kahura thanked the participants, the University of Leeds and the two lectures from the University of Nairobi. The teachers were equipped with practical skills in film shooting, editing and writing. This is expected to propel the nation towards the achievement of Vision 2030, says Dr Otieno.
