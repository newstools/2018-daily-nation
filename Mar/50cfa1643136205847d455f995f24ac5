Release of marked answer sheets to schools will prejudice security features, the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) has said. In a case in which activist Okiya Omtatah is seeking to have Knec compelled to release marked answer sheets to schools, the council’s acting Chief executive Mercy Karogo opposed such a call. In her response, Ms Karogo pointed that after national examination results have been released, schools receive feedback to serve as a guide for preparations for future exams. “Knec wishes to caution that any directive to release marking schemes or marked answer scripts will compromise security of national examinations,” Ms Karogo said. In filed papers, she said that all procedures for test development, administration, marking, awarding and grade setting were duly followed in the 2017 national examinations. “The council wishes to categorically state that the 2017 examinations and subsequent investigations were conducted objectively, fairly in compliance with all laws and regulations, without malice or ulterior motive against any candidate,” she said. While Knec wants the case dismissed, Mr Omtatah argues that failure to release answer sheets for national examinations is a violation of a fundamental right. According to Mr Omtatah, it has been the tradition for Kenya Certificate of Primary Education and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education answer sheets to be kept by Knec, yet those who sit for those examinations have every right to access the marked papers. He argues that failure to release the marked answer sheets is arbitrary and leaves the marking shrouded in secrecy.
