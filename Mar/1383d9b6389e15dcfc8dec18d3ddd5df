Detectives from the anti-graft agency on Friday raided private residences and offices of three officials at the Pyrethrum Processing Company of Kenya (PPCK) headquarters in Nakuru town over corruption claims. The team from the the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) confiscated documents suspected to be related to corruption activities in the company. The investigators raided the houses and offices of the company’s Managing Director Paul Lolwerikoi, marketing director and the accountant. The documents that were seized are suspected to be related to flouted procurement procedures, illegal leasing of the company’s assets and controversial tenders and contract documents. The commission’s South Rift Deputy Manager Christine Natome said its officers took action after receiving reports linking senior officials at the firm with corruption dealings. He said they obtained a search warrant from the court on Thursday. The detectives also interrogated Mr Lolwerikoi for hours at the EACC South Rift headquarters before he was released. In February, Pyrethrum Board of Kenya Staff Superannuation Scheme raised a red flag over the lease of the properties belonging to the defunct Pyrethrum Board of Kenya (PBK) by PPCK. The former board has property spread across the country worth more than Sh4 billion. The scheme members led by their spokesperson  Harun Tinga said it was wrong for PPCK to lease some of its properties while the scheme is in the process of being liquidated. The scheme was liquidated last year due heavy debts amounting to nearly Sh2billion owed to pensioners and more than 200 workers at the Nakuru factory.
