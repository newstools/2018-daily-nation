Nasa leader Raila Odinga arrived at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Monday evening to secure the release of Mr Miguna Miguna. Mr Miguna had refused to leave the airport since his arrival in the country at 2.30pm on Monday. Mr Odinga's arrival came after mediation efforts failed. The government had insisted that Mr Miguna surrenders his Canadian passport before being allowed into the country. Mr Odinga was accompanied by Senate Minority leader James Orengo. Supporters of self-declared National Resistance Movement general Miguna Miguna on Monday evening confronted immigration officers at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. They demanded that Mr Miguna be allowed to leave the airport where he has been detained since 2.30pm. Mr Miguna said that the frustrations he was being subjected to were a violation of his rights. “What I can see here is that my rights have continued to be violated. My security is at stake and the people who are frustrating me here, are not immigration officers but the police from the flying squad,” Mr Miguna told the press. He was flanked by his lawyers, Nasa leader Raila Odinga and hundreds of supporters who went to the airport to welcome him. Raila’s motorcade drove to the airport at around 9.30pm. The Nasa supporters started heading to the airport in the evening to pile pressure on the government and have Mr Miguna released. Dr Miguna was deported at night on February 6, put into a KLM flight departing Nairobi for Amsterdam minutes to 10pm.
