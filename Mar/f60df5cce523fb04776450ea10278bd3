President Uhuru Kenyatta will Tuesday leave for a three-day state visit to Cuba. The visit is aimed at bolstering bilateral relations and deepening collaboration and cooperation in health, sports, culture, blue economy and trade, a statement from State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said. Last year, Kenya and Cuba signed an MoU on health cooperation. “There is a great opportunity for the two nations to expand the MoU’s implementation for the achievement of universal healthcare, an important deliverable in President Kenyatta’s agenda,” he said.
