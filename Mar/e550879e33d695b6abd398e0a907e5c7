Marvin Omondi's wonder strike gave AFC Leopards a thrilling 4-3 win over Mathare United in a Kenyan Premier League match at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos on Saturday. Earlier at the same venue, Sofapaka drew 0-0 with Kariobangi Sharks. This was Mathare’s first defeat of the season as they missed on a chance to go top of the table as AFC Leopards moved to third spot after recording back-to-back wins when many had given them little chance. Omondi delivered a brace for Ingwe as Duncan Otieno and Ezekiel Odera complemented his efforts with a goal each. Cliff Nyakeya also grabbed a brace for Mathare and Francis Omondi one strike as they fell behind late in the rain-lashed game. The “Slum Boys” were first to score, Nyakeya bursting into a run on the left after intercepting a misplaced back heel and planting the ball into the net. Ingwe equalised 11 minutes later through Omondi, whose powerful delivery hit the crossbar and bounced down on the goal line and out of the pitch. The referee rightly allowed the goal to stand much to the delight of the Ingwe fans. At the half hour mark, Mathare regained the lead. Nyakeya had been felled inside the box and Francis Omondi stepped forward to send the resultant penalty home. At the Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega, Masita Masuta came off the bench to score a late winner as former champions Ulinzi Stars beat Kakamega Homeboyz 1-0. In other matches Saturday, Zoo Kericho played out a goalless draw with Vihiga United, with Posta Rangers and Wazito also settling for the same score line in their encounter.
