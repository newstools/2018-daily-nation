The prospect of an all-Kenyan final in the 2018 Women’s Africa Club Volleyball Championship face a stern test when Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons take to the court on Tuesday evening in Cairo. Prisons take on defending champions Carthage while Pipeline battle hosts Al Ahly in the last four with a place in the final at stake. This will be the second last hurdle for the two teams in their quest to bring home the continental title that has eluded Kenya for four years now. Should they win their respective matches, the two Kenyan representatives will set-up an all-Kenyan clash in the final set for Thursday. Prisons’ battle against defending champions Carthage will serve off at 5pm (EAT) at the Al Ahly Sports Hall, while Pipeline will face last year’s finalists Al Ahly from 9pm (EAT) at the same venue. “We were not at our best in the quarterfinals, so I was very happy that we managed to beat them and make it here. This time round there is no room for mistakes because we are still aiming for the ultimate prize,” said Prisons coach David Lung’aho after their win over Rwanda’s Revenue Authority in the last eight. Lung'aho is likely to stick with his preferred six that did duty against Rwanda’s Revenue Authority on Monday, which includes captain Mercy Moim, former French based star Everlyne Makuto, main blocker Edith Wisa, Kwanthanze alumni Emmaculate Chemtai, libero Elizabeth Wanyama and upcoming setter Joy Luseneka. WANJA RETURNS Pipeline coach Japheth Munala is expected to also incorporate the experience of award-winning setter Janet Wanja as he plots to help the team clinch an eighth continental crown. To get to this stage, Pipeline were forced to dig deep in order to secure a 3-2 sets win over Cameroon’s Bafia on Monday. Tunisia’s Carthage on the other hand beat El Shams of Egypt 3-1 (25-8, 20-25, 27-25, 25-23) in the quarterfinals, while hosts Al Ahly reached the semis after crushing Customs 3-0 (25-13, 25-9, 29-27) in the last quarterfinal match on Monday. Prisons other victories in this tournament came against Nigeria Customs Club 3-0 (25-10, 25-15, 25-15), Cote d'Ivoire's Asec Mimosas 3-0 sets (25-7,25-17,25-12)and Burundi's DOUANES 3-1(25-15,25-5,23-25,25-11). Pipeline meanwhile defeated hosts El Shams 3-0 sets (25-23, 25-22,25-22) in their opening fixture, and followed this result up with a similar straight set victory of 25-6,25-10,25-13 over Democratic Republic of Congo's DGSP.   Kenyan sides on course to meet in the final.
