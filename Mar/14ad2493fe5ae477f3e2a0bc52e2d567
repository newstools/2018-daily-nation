Kenyans Bethwell Birgen and Davis Kiplagat will be under pressure on Friday when they compete in the 3,000 metres final at the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Birmingham, England. Emmanuel Korir, who is favourite to win men’s 800m title, fields in the heats on Friday while compatriots Beatrice Chepkoech, who is fresh from winning the 2018 World Indoor Tour 1,500m series, and Winny Chebet compete in women’s 1,500m heats. Birgen warmed up to the race with victory in men’s 1,500m at the Glasgow Indoor Championships on Sunday, the last event in the World Indoor Tour ahead of the World Championships. Birgen clocked 3:37.76 to win, brushing aside Kenya’s representative in the metric mile race Vincent Kibet to second place in 3:37.88. Birgen finished second while Kiplagat fourth in 3,000m at Meeting Dusseldorf Indoor on February 4 in Germany. Kiplangat was placed fourth again in the 3,000m race in Glasgow. It will be the first time Kiplagat is competing for Kenya at World Indoor while Birgen is making a return after he failed to reach the final in men’s 1,500m at the 2016 World Indoor Championships in Portland, USA. Birgen competed in 1,500m outdoor at the 2013 World Championships where he fell in the semi-finals. Kiplagat, who represented Kenya in 5,000m at the World Championships in London, is a Commonwealth Youth Games 3,000m champion, having also won silver medal in the 10,000m at the 2016 Africa junior Championships before winning 3000m gold at the Africa Youth championships the same year. Kenya is gunning to reclaim the 3,000m title they lost to Ethiopian Yomif Kejelcha during the 2016 Portland World Indoor Championships where Augustine Choge settled for bronze. Caleb Mwangangi won the event during the 2014 Sopot. Birgen and Barega will take on Kejelcha alongside his compatriots Selemon Barega and Hagos Gebrhiwet. Barega won the 2017 World Under-18 and 2016 Woerld Under-20 5,000m titles Gebrhiwet won in Karlsruhe in 7:37.91 and finished second in Boston while Kejelcha earned a wild card for the championships by winning the IAAF World Indoor Tour. Others to watch out for are USA’s Paul Chelimo. Kenya’s World outdoor 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri was due to battle in women’s 3,000m final last night.   The American set a new world indoor record for the 60m.
