Yields on Kenya’s sovereign bonds have continued to fall since mid-February, indicating that investors are taking a positive outlook on the country following the conclusion of the elections period in 2017. Data on the secondary market yields of the 10-year 2014 bond that matures in 2024 shows a fall of 34 basis points (equivalent to 0.34 percentage points) to 6.39 per cent since February 15, while the yield on the five-year tranche that matures next year has fallen nine basis points (0.09 percentage points) to 3.87 per cent in the period.

The newly issued 10-year and 30-year Eurobonds, which have been trading on the London Stock Exchange for the last two weeks, have also seen their yields come down relative to the issuance coupon rate.
