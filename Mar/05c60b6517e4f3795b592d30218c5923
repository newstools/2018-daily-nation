For many elderly Kenyans, the rollout by the government of the Old Persons Cash Transfer is a godsend. Many of these senior citizens have been a forgotten lot who trudge through their sunset years scrounging for food, clothing and shelter. Statistics from the State Department of Social Protection indicate that some 566,000 people aged over 70 have sought to be included in the programme. This is in addition to the 310,000 old people who already receiving Sh4,000 each every two months. But reports from the disbursement points are not encouraging. Many a time, these old Kenyans, most of them weak and in poor health, are made to stand in long queues waiting to be given the money.

Whereas the paying institutions have a duty to ensure that only the deserving people benefit, the verification should not expose the elders to ridicule and embarrassment. Additional ways of identifying beneficiaries, other than just the fingerprints, should be identified and used.
