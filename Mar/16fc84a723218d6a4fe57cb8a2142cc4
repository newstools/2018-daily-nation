Kenyan Premier League giants AFC Leopards have reportedly asked head coach Robert Matano to step aside, Nation Sport has learnt. Matano, under-fire after a below par start to the 2018 season, was missing during the team's training session on Friday morning ahead of their weekend tie away to Sony Sugar. Leopards lost 2-1 to Sofapaka in their last league outing on Wednesday and were dumped out of the Caf Confederation Cup by lowly Madagascan side Fosa Juniors in the preliminaries last week. Matano, who led the 13-time champions to the GOtv Shield last year, is also said to be facing a disciplinary case within the club with midfielder Collins "Gattuso" Okoth also suspended alongside the coach. “Matano has not been suspended, nor has been sacked. He was just asked to step aside briefly,” club secretary Oscar Igaida said while dispelling rumours going round on social media that the club has parted ways with the veteran coach. “We have asked Matano to appear before our executive committee on Tuesday to give his evaluation report on the team’s performance in the last five matches.” The five matches are the club's opening three league matches and the two legged Confederation Cup tie against Fosa Juniors. “We shall have a comprehensive road map on the way forward after meeting with him on Tuesday.” Okoth is said to have been skipping a training sessions while Matano's failure to lead Leopards to a steady start to the season have seen the club's Executive Committee take the above action. Matano's long-serving assistant Dennis Kitambi will temporarily take charge of the team and will be on the touchline in their league match against Sony Sugar on Sunday in Awendo.
