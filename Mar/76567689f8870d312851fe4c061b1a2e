The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has written to Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka seeking the removal of Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula as the Leader of Minority. The orange party wants Mr Wetang’ula replaced by Siaya Senator James Orengo. Even though Speaker Lusaka ruled the meeting that resolved to have Mr Wetang’ula removed was valid, his removal would be suspended as the election of his replacement was unprocedural. At the same time, a defiant Mr Wetang’ula Thursday declared that he is going nowhere, warning ODM to prepare for a “messy divorce”. “If you want a divorce, then you must be ready because it will be noisy, messy and it will not be easy," the Bungoma senator warned.
