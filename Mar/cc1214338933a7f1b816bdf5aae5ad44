The incentives introduced by Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) in a bid to spur the performance of Kenyan professionals in the Barclays Kenya Open championships that takes place this week at Muthaiga Golf Club are welcome. Any of the 22 Kenyans making a cut after the second round of play on Friday is guaranteed a Sh100,000 prize while a top 10 finish will earn one Sh500,000 each. Only three Kenyans — Simon Ngige, Dismas Indiza and Riz Charania — made a cut last year but none made the top 10 list with Ngigi the best in 34th place. PRIZE MONEYThe small gesture will encourage and support local players in their quest to win their maiden Kenya Open title at this European Challenge Tour event. We nonetheless expect KOGL to increase the reward package in subsequent events, considering the amount of resources local players put into their preparations. KOGL has announced an increased prize package of Sh62.5 million for this year’s Kenya Open, making it the most lucrative event on the European Challenge Tour. That marked a remarkable increase of almost 127 per cent from last year’s prize fund of Sh 27.3 million. However, KOGL and other sponsors should sponsor local players who make the cut in other major tour events. That is only that way Kenya will produce quality players who can challenge their superior rivals from Europe.
