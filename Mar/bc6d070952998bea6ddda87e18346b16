Hundreds of youth in the Rift Valley, who depended on logging, saw-milling and charcoal burning, have been left jobless after the government banned the activities. The youth whose main source of livelihood was timber trade have appealed to President Kenyatta to help them secure other sources of earning a living. The Nation has learnt that close to 1,000 young men and women from Elburgon, Molo, Total, Makutano, Maji Mazuri, Uasin Gishu and Timboroa and some parts of Mount Kenya lost jobs. AFFECTED GROUPS The youth worked as loaders, tree cutters (power saw operators), transporters and millers. Others affected were people who performed other manual duties such as clearing milling zones. The multi-billion industry has over the past 10 years been one of Kenyaâ€™s best employer especially to the uneducated youth. The Nation established that loaders, tree cutters and millers on a bad day could take home between Sh800 and Sh3,200 as wages. Elburgon Timber Manufacturers Association chairman Benard Gitau said hundreds of people have been affected by the ban either directly or indirectly.
