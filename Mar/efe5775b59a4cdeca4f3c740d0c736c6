An environmental conservation NGO is seeking changes to the Petroleum Bill, saying its provisions for pipeline construction could interfere with national parks, forest reserves and monuments. Nature Kenya has asked Parliament to amend a clause of the Bill, which is seen to give oil companies a free hand to build pipeline on any piece of public land, including those that should be protected for the national good. Kenya plans to build a crude oil pipeline to run 865 kilometres from its Turkana oilfields to Lamu port by 2021 at a cost of Sh210 billion for commercial exports. “The current version of the Bill allows oil and gas pipelines to go across any national government property. National government property of course includes national parks, forest reserves, heritage sites and other sites,” Nature Kenya executive director Paul Matiku says in a letter addressed to Parliament and copied to ministries of Petroleum, Environment and Wildlife. The agency now wants MPs to amend the Bill to categorically state that national parks, forest reserves and national monuments are out of bounds in construction of such mega infrastructure.
