Central regional coordinator Wilson Njenga has directed security officers to crack down on re-emerging organised criminal gangs in the region. He said criminal gangs such as Mungiki have re-emerged and are posing a major security threat. THREAT Addressing senior police officers, county and sub-county commissioners, chiefs and their assistants at Ol Kalou Catholic Hall in Nyandarua County, the administrator. “We thought we had eliminated the criminal gangs during the previous crackdown but it appears they just hibernated. They are back and we must mercilessly deal with them. “We are also aware that each area has different types of organised criminal gangs. They must all be dealt with, they have no place in Central Kenya,” he said. Mr Njenga said security officials will also crack down on illicit and second generation alcoholic drinks. “We have made remarkable achievements and discovered a lot of things in the process. “We have established that there are many counterfeit products in Central Kenya including beer, bottled water, among others. We have engaged professionals and other government agents to assist us in that,” said Mr Njenga. COUNTERFEITS He cited a trader in Murang’a who was found making counterfeit Tusker beer in his house and using fake Kenya Bureau of Standards stickers. He also said the alcohol content in counterfeit drinks differs from that contained in the genuine drinks of the same brand. “No alcoholic brand going by the same name should have more alcohol content than others. “During testing, we found similar brands some with up to 70 percent alcoholic content while others had as low as 40 percent. It means they are not all from the licensed manufacturer,” said the regional boss.
