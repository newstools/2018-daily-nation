The setting up of a task force to review forestry management is a good indication of the government’s resolve to walk the talk on the crucial issue of conservation. It comes in the wake of Deputy President William Ruto’s three-month ban on logging in the forests, which appeared to be more of a knee-jerk reaction to a sorry situation that could deteriorate. And the team has wasted no time in getting down to business by calling on Mr Ruto, who has vowed that no efforts will be spared in the campaign to not only stop the depletion of forests but also repair the damage done. We hope the momentum will be ramped up. That the country is on the path to self-destruction is evident in the fact that 500,000 acres of exotic and indigenous trees have been destroyed and water catchment areas degraded. We couldn’t agree more with the DP that some painful sacrifices have to be made to protect forests. Kenya’s forest cover is below the United Nations-recommended 10 per cent, though it improved from 1.7 per cent in 2000 to seven per cent in 2013. Clearly, there is still a lot more work to do to attain and exceed the UN baseline. And with the rains here already, the message should be about planting trees. The task force says it will seek views from the public and come up with recommendations. This is okay, but the accent should be on practical solutions.
