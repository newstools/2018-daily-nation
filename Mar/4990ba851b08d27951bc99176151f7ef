Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons, who are some of the most successful clubs in women’s volleyball on the continent, are in Cairo, Egypt, for the Women’s Africa Club Championship from Tuesday. Having dominated the sport five years ago, the two clubs have an uphill task to fulfill in a bid to reclaim the title for Kenya. They have the onus of reclaiming our fading glory and dominance in the women’s contest. A formidable task awaits them as they prepare to face their rivals from North Africa and West Africa — the likes of Al Ahly and El Shaams (Egypt), Carthage (Tunisia), Nedjmet (Algeria), Nigeria Customs Volleyball Club, Bafia (Cameroon) and Asec Mimoas (Cote d’Ivoire). BEST PLAYERS The Kenyan sides boast some of the best players in Africa — including Janet Wanja, Trizah Atuka, Everlyne Makuto, Elizabeth Wanyama and Noel Murambi — who are all certain to make a positive impact. Despite challenges in preparations, including relocating from the Kasarani gymnasium to allow the venue to host the Africa Table Tennis Championship, Pipeline and Prisons are expected to make it to the podium. But even as we cheer our stellar girls, we urge the government to develop this sport by building indoor gymnasiums for competition and training. Poor performance by clubs is evidently reflected in the national team, and so it is vital to help clubs to train well.
