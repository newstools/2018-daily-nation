There is an interesting development that could greatly change the public perception of the African Union. Seen by the majority ordinary Africans mostly as a club for leaders to pursue personal interests, the continental organisation is venturing into an area that is bound to make it more valuable to all: The planned African Continental Free Trade Area. It is really good news that the leaders, who are in Kigali this week for an extraordinary summit of the AU, will sign an agreement to kick-start the initiative. The poorest continent has immense potential with huge resources that remain untapped. But even more important is the vast potential market of 1.2 billion. Developing this market is an idea whose time has come. It ties in very well with the crusade for greater co-operation and trade in the South. Individual African countries cannot make an impact in international trade as the global system is skewed towards the North. The trade zone must be nurtured an entrenched. The airline industry, for instance, should already be salivating at the prospect of open continental skies. Co-operation between the various tiny, struggling national carriers should boost gains from the aviation industry. Regional economic blocs have shown the benefits of integration. A continental zone will have even greater muscle to pool resources for economic prosperity.
