The phase two and three construction of Dongo Kundu bypass to connect North Coast and South Coast at a cost of Sh30 billion will start in June. The Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) on Friday said tenders for the project will be awarded soon. Assistant director of corporate communication, Mr Charles Njogu, said phase one is 80 per cent complete. “The project is running smoothly and in three months’ time, we will be starting the last two phases. "The tenders for the project were evaluated last month and soon we will know who has been awarded so that we can get the project moving,” Mr Njogu said. INTERCHANGEPhase two is 8.9km between Mwache Junction and Mteza, while phase three is 6.9km between Mteza and Kibundani, linking the highway with the Likoni-Lunga Lunga Road. Mr Njogu said there will be an interchange at the Likoni-Lunga Lunga highway, adding that the phases will further involve construction of two bridges, one at Mwache that will be 900 metres long and another at Mteza, 1.4km long. A sightseeing bay will also be done and 88 hectares of mangroves will be replanted. DECONGESTIONThe construction of phase one, which includes an 11km road between Mombasa port and Miritini at a cost of Sh11 billion, started on July 2016. It runs from Mombasa Port’s second container terminal and links the Mombasa-Nairobi Highway at Bonje, near Mazeras. The bypass was proposed 30 years ago to decongest Mombasa.
