The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions wants orders stopping the criminal case against businessman Jimi Wanjigi over illegal possession of prohibited firearms set aside. The DPP, through State lawyer Victor Mule, said the High Court issued the reprieve order to Mr Wanjigi because there was non-disclosure of facts.

He also alleged that during the raid at Mr Wanjigi’s residence at Muthaiga in October last year, police recovered seven firearms, some of which are considered as high power fire rifles mainly used by special forces and not civilians. “Owing to the nature and seriousness of offences facing Mr Wanjigi, the orders issued on March 1 should be set aside,” the state counsel said. According to the DPP, Mr Wanjigi’s firearm certificate has been revoked thrice; in 2001, 2007 and most recently on January 30, since 1995 when he was first issued with it. The certificate was revoked on grounds that he threatened the public on November 22, 2001.
