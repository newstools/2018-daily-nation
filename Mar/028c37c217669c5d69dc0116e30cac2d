A man and his wife on Monday morning denied attempting to kill a close family member. Mr Alfred Moffard Omundi and his third wife Irene Nyakerario appeared in a Keroka court. The prosecution said they attempted to kill Mr Eric Metobo Omundi. They were also charged with robbing him of Sh20,000, shoes and clothes valued at Sh20,000 and injuring him. AXES AND PANGAS The court was told that the two, eight others and several suspects still at large were armed with iron bars, axes and pangas during the robbery. They faced another count of robbing Ms Mary Kwamboka Omundi, the man's first wife, of Sh100,000, shoes, clothes and other household items all valued at Sh220,000. The court freed the 10 on a Sh300,000 bond each and a surety of the same amount. CAUTION Mr Eric Omundi is the son of Ms Kwamboka. The prosecution said Mr Omundi and his third wife hired a group on Friday night to help them with some work at Ms Kwamboka's house. Defence lawyer Dennis Nyatundo urged the court to tread with caution as it was handling a family dispute. He said the businessman and his third wife wanted to move Ms Kwamboka from Manga to Birongo and that is why they were accompanied by the group. OUTLAWED The group, the court was told, was part of an outlawed gang in Kisii town. "They wanted to kill me and my mother. Our father wants us out of our home," Mr Eric Omundi said. One of the "gang" members died when he was attacked by villagers when Ms Kwamboka and her son raised alarm. The case will be mentioned on March 26 and heard on May 3.
