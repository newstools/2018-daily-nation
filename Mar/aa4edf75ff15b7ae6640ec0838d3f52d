Lawyers James Orengo and Otiende Amollo have stuck court orders demanding the release of Miguna Miguna at the Immigration Department's offices at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Mr Orengo said they pinned the court orders at "conspicuous places", saying no official was present to receive them. He added that they hope Dr Miguna will be released today. Earlier in the day, Justice Roselyn Aburili had instructed the government to release Dr Miguna, who is being detained at the airport. Justice Aburili further said that the lawyer should appear in court on Wednesday. LSK The directive was issued after Dr Miguna's lawyers (John Khaminwa, Nelson Havi and Julie Soweto) sued the government over the matter. The lawyers complained about mistreatment of Dr Miguna by security officers, claiming that he has not been allowed to communicate with anyone. The Law Society of Kenya joined them in criticising the government over the handling of the National Super Alliance member. In a statement, the agency said: "The LSK stands for adherence to the rule of law and lawful and fair treatment of citizens. We are also concerned about the manner in which Dr Miguna Miguna was treated by the security officers."   Dr Miguna's lawyers want him released unconditionally.
