Nasa leader Raila Odinga has revealed more details of the talks he held with his political archrival President Uhuru Kenyatta earlier this month. During a visit to his home turf of Kisumu on Friday evening Mr Odinga said that victims of violence during the last General Election will be compensated by the government. DEAL "Many of our people were killed and maimed following the elections last year. We agreed with President Kenyatta that all these among other injustices must be addressed and compensation made to the affected families," Mr Odinga said. Anti-government protests erupted in some parts of the county following the 2017 General Election and the repeat presidential poll. Dozens of people were killed and others injured as police moved to quell the protests. Mr Odinga also revealed that he reached an agreement with the President that suspects facing charges in connection with his January 30 ‘oath’ be freed and charges dropped.   Mr Odinga said he discussed with Mr Kenyatta a myriad of issues aimed at burying old enmities and fostering unity among the country's communities. The opposition leader made a triumphant entry into Kisumu’s Kondele, one of the epic centres of the 2017 post-election violence, for the first time after he declared he would work with his President Kenyatta to cheers from a huge crows. While addressing the crowd, Mr Odinga clarified that the talks were between 'two' presidents and not between Nasa and Jubilee.
