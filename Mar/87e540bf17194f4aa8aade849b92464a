Motorists will now pay to enter the standard gauge railway (SGR) stations after Kenya Railways dropped free parking in a move aimed at increasing income from the mega project. Under the new parking fee, saloon cars accessing the SGR stations to pick or drop passengers will part with Sh100. Large trucks and buses will pay Sh200 while mini-buses and pick-ups will part with Sh150 and Sh100 respectively. “Kenya Railways is in the process of installing automatic parking management system. In the interim, manual ticketing on all SGR stations has been put in place which will see motorists pay parking fee to access the SGR stations. This is part of a wider plan aimed at keeping us afloat financially,” said KR managing director Atanas Maina. The corporation has not been making meaningful profit since it launched the Madaraka Express train last June. The situation got worse early this month when they launched the SGR freight  train between Nairobi and  the coastal town of Mombasa  after more than six months of testing.
