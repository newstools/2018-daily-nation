The Jubilee Party is battling to avert a looming fallout over suspension of Kenyatta National Hospital CEO Lily Koros. Some Kalenjin MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto have threatened to impeach Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki for sending Ms Koros home. TALKS Deputy President William Ruto on Friday instructed National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale to meet with Ms Kariuki and the MPs who want her pushed out. While speaking at Parliament Buildings, Mr Duale said he intends to meet the CS before meeting the lawmakers later in the day. He said Jubilee is determined to have the matter settled internally and not have their "dirty linen washed public". Mr Ruto waded into the conflict on Thursday, with sources indicating that he had spoken to several MPs angling for the impeachment of Ms Kariuki. Mr Ruto, the sources said, asked the lawmakers to go easy on Ms Kariuki, promising them he is working on a solution for a conflict that threatens the unity of the ruling party. At least four MPs, all drawn from the Kalenjin community, said they had talked to the DP over the issue but remained cagey on what exactly was agreed upon. The MPs are angry at the manner Ms Kariuki is running Afya House and are collecting signatures for a petition to have her impeached. So far more than 150 MPs from across the political divide have signed the petition.   More follows.   DP Ruto and CS Sicily Kariuki fight for the soul of Kenya's top referral hospital.
