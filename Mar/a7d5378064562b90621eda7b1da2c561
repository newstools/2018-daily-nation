A software development company in Nairobi has launched a mobile app meant to help farmers maintain their inventories. Intersoft Eagles Limited says it is plugging a gap in dairy farming where farmers find it hard tracking their records, probably because they lose some of their bulky papers. Through the Smart Cow App, dairy farmers are able to monitor their expenditure and income. It is easy to know whether the dairy venture is making profits or losses. The app, which is developed for Android smart phones, targets both small-scale and commercial dairy farmers. “Farmers rarely keep records of the dairy venture. If at all they do they can’t closely monitor the previous date for routine dairy practices and the next date schedule,” says Intersoft Operations Director Levis Wambura.

Smart Cow is developed in such a way that farmer can analyse the bio history of each animal and production levels. Mr Wambura says it provides an interactive chatting platform for farmers and experts in the dairy sub-sector. “We have a module for farmers to ask and post questions to experts on the chatting platform. They get first hand, accurate information from our veterinary officers,” he says.
