The Commission for University Education (CUE) on Thursday shutdown two campuses in western Kenya as it intensified a crack down on institutions that have not complied with regulations. The CUE closed Uzima University College in Kisumu, a constituent college of the Catholic University of Eastern Africa, and Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) campus in Budalang’i, Busia County. Prof Mwendwa Ntaragwi, the chief executive, said the two institutions had been closed for failing to adhere to set standards. “We will not tolerate institutions that are not meeting the minimum set standards in provision of quality education,” Prof Ntaragwi said.

At MMUST campus, the officials marked key buildings with an X-mark with ‘CUE’ word inscribed on the walls. The campus billboard on the Port Victoria-Busia highway was defaced with the same marks. Uncertainty now surrounds the over 200 students who were undertaking programmes at the institution. Prof Fredrick Otieno, MMUST Vice-Chancellor, could not be reached for a comment as was the management of Uzima University College, which is under the management of Catholic Archdiocese of Kisumu.
