The Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association’s special full council meeting set for Saturday at the Nairobi Gymkhana was called off at the eleventh hour. The main agenda of the meeting was to pick eight delegates who will represent NPCA at Cricket Kenya’s special general meeting set for March 24 after the resignation of both CK chairlady, Jackie Jan Mohammed and director of development, Abhijeet Raja Sarkar. The two presented their letters of resignation to CK general manager Josephat Murithi during the CK board meeting on February 17. The decision of NPCA executive committee to call off their special general meeting is said to have been influenced by an independent legal opinion sought by CK vice-chairman, Harpal Singh Sehmi, on the validity of the said CK’s special general meeting. Sehmi told Nation Sport that the NPCA executive committee was asked to vacate the special general meeting invitation because any election conducted thereunder would be contrary to Article 12.11 of CK constitution. The article states in part that: “A special general meeting shall be called at any time by written resolution signed by two thirds of council members or at the direction of executive committee to discuss urgent matters.” The procedure in which CK should fill vacancies is explained in article 12.11 of the constitution that provides that “should a vacancy occur in the executive committee of an elected member, the committee shall call a special general meeting and elect a new member within 30 days of the vacancy occurring.”
