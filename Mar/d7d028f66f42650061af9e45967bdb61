Ken Kenyatta’s Ushuru suffered their second consecutive defeat in the National Super League (NSL) after falling 2-0 to Kenya Police at Camp Toyoyo grounds on Saturday. At the same venue, Kibera Black Stars beat Administration Police 1-0 to move joint top with Western Stima on 10 points. Stima humiliated debutantes Kangemi AllStars 4-0 in Kisumu to take control of the standings. At Camp Toyoyo in the 2pm kick-off, Benjamin Mageson gave Police the lead in the first half before former Kenyan international Patrick Oboya doubled their advantage from a penalty spot towards the end of the game. Ushuru have themselves to blame for the loss after squandering clear cut chances in both halves. Benson Amianda came close on 56 minutes but his header from Edwin Mwaura’s cross landed on the roof of the net. In the 77th minute, Oscar Mbugua missed a golden chance in a one against one situation with Police goalkeeper Anthony Obonyo who produced two great saves to deny both Mbugua and Barrack Odhiambo, the latter from the rebound. Ushuru fell 1-0 to Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) at the same venue last Sunday with the latest defeat leaving Kenyatta with a lot to ponder as the race for promotion to the Kenyan Premier League gathers pace. At the Moi Stadium in Kisumu, John Oruko and John Mwita netted a goal apiece in the fifth and 45th minute before Austine Ochieng and Herbert Kopany completed the rout with goals in the 79th and 90th minutes respectively.
