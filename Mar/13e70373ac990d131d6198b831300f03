Police have arrested a key suspect linked to the killer gang in Bungoma County, whose members have been terrorising villagers in Mt Elgon. The suspect, identified as Ben Juma, features on the list of members of the criminal gang being sought by police for committing murder and robberies. INVESTIGATION Western Region DCI boss David Cheruiyot said the suspect was taken to the regional police headquarters for questioning. Police said the key suspect, Timothy Kiptanui Kitai alias Cheparkach, is on the run after a Sh1 million bounty was placed on his head. They believe he is hiding in Trans-Nzoia County. Police also believe Juma is a close ally of Cheparkach. “We have the suspect but we will give further details tomorrow,” said Mr Cheruiyot who barred journalists from photographing the suspect. The arrest comes days after the government declared a three-month curfew in the troubled region and announced a crackdown on a criminal gang involved in attacks. SECURITY Twenty villagers have been killed in the last two months. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i toured the area on Tuesday and said more security officers would be deployed to the region to deal with the criminal gang. “The Government will deploy additional security officers and intensify patrols and ensure prompt response to attacks. “We are going to hunt them down and ensure they face the law,” he said. The CS warned against disobeying the curfew directive. He asked communities to work with the police to apprehend criminals.
