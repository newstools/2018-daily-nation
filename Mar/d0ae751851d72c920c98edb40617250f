The chorus of praise for the Meteorological Department for accurately predicting when the rains would begin, is a public vote of confidence in the institution. The weatherman gave the exact day of the first deluge of the new rainy season and for how long. However, itâ€™s disappointing that despite the accurate forecast and a warning that the rains would be heavy, the country has once again been caught napping. This is perhaps partly due to the scepticism arising from lousy past predictions. But more worrying is the exposure of the lack of capacity to deal with floods. A country, whose vast swathes of land have been ravaged by a long drought, is now awash with water it does not know how to deal with. It is a sorry state of suffering and agony when it rains and also when it shines. The perennial utter helplessness of the people, the various agencies, and the national and county leadership is astounding, and costly. Seven people have died across the country in the past two days, and there is every indication that there will be more deaths and the destruction of homes and property. There is no joy even as we have more water than we actually need, but most of it will just flow to waste, and once the rains subside, we will once again experience acute shortages. The irony is that we all know what needs to be done, but are not doing it. Rain is blessing, but it will remain a curse if we do not build the capacity to trap the water and make better use of it.
