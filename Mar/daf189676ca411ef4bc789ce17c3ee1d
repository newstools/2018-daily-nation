A secondary school deputy principal has committed suicide in Baringo North sub-county, two weeks after the death of the principal. Ms Norah Koech, Bossei Day Secondary School deputy headteacher, hanged herself in her house on Wednesday. Ms Koech, 40, is said to have locked her two children inside their room, in a rented house near the school, before hanging herself in the sitting room. While confirming the incident, Kelyo Location Chief Simon Cheraste said the deceased had been acting as principal after the death of Mr Isaac Chebor two weeks ago. Mr Cheraste said neighbours rushed to Ms Koech's house after they heard her children scream, only to find the teacher's lifeless body hanging from the roof. The teacher, who hails from Seretunin in Baringo Central, has left behind three young children. PREPARING TO TRAVEL “We fail to understand why the teacher resorted to end her life. In fact, she was the acting principal after the demise of Mr Chebor two weeks ago,” said Mr Cheraste. He said that the deceased had left her youngest child in the care of a relative after saying that she was preparing to travel the following day. “We believe that the teacher had planned to end her life as she had left her young child in the care of a relative,” said the chief. SHARE PROBLEMS Speaking to the Nation on phone, Baringo Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary Joshua Cheptarus urged teachers to share their problems instead of resorting to suicide. “We are very sorry for what happened but people should learn to share their problems instead of resorting to such solutions,” said Mr Cheptarus. Teachers in the school and the locals were left in shock, considering that the incident happened barely a month after the death of the principal. The body of the deceased was taken o the Baringo County Referral Hospital mortuary in Kabarnet.   Ms Awinja was set ablaze by her husband after she accused him of cheating on her.
