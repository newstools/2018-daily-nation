Former Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel has been released on police cash bail and will now appear in a Nanyuki court on Friday to answer charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Laikipia County Police Commander Simon Kipkeu confirmed the release of the politician. He said this was necessitated by the fact that Mr Lempurkel is scheduled to appear at a Milimani court in Nairobi. “We have released him on a cash bail of Sh50,000 and directed him to appear before a magistrate’s court on Friday. This is to enable him travel to Nairobi for a hearing of a case where he is accused of assaulting Laikipia North MP Sarah Korere,” said Mr Kipkeu. MURDER CONSPIRACY However, the police boss declined to reveal the person the former MP had allegedly conspired to murder but police sources indicated that he would be charged with planning to kill a senior security officer in Laikipia. Mr Lempurkel was arrested on Tuesday, soon after Nanyuki Chief Magistrate Lucy Mutai ruled that the he had case to answer on incitement to violence charges facing him. INCITEMENT The former ODM legislator had denied that he incited his supporters to burn down Rumuruti Police Station on July 31, 2016 in an effort to free a suspect held in police custody over illegal grazing. On Tuesday, he called a defence witness Julius Elokomela to support his argument in court that he had not planned to free the suspect but had gone to ask police officers to take him to hospital. The incitement to violence case will be mentioned on Monday, March 19, when defence lawyer William Bwonwonga will give final submissions before a judgment is delivered.   Bail ruling delivered at 6.30pm long after the court registry had closed for the day.
