Residents of Nyanchwa Estate in Kisii Town were shocked on Saturday afternoon when they found a human head and arm dumped by the road. The two body parts had been stuffed inside a black plastic bag and placed inside a green bucket. There was a cut on the back of the head. SHOCK Mr Nathan Orare, a motorcycle rider, said he used the road several times in the morning to ferry passengers but he did not give much thought about the bucket. Mr Orare said that at 2pm, curious residents wondered why its owner was not picking it up and they lifted its lid. “I saw this bucket from around 10am. At around 2pm, I came back from town to drop a passenger and saw people surrounding it. “I am shocked beyond words on seeing its contents,” he said.   SCARY Mr Orare questioned the intention of the person who placed the bucket by the road. “This is scary. Police should investigate and arrest the person behind this incident. We also want to know what their motive was. “They must be very courageous people because they did not bother to hide the remains despite this being a busy road,” Mr Orare said. WITCHCRAFT Shocked onlookers said they suspected witchcraft, saying the body parts might have been used for a ritual. Police officers collected the body parts and they are investigating the incident. Kisii County police commander Abdi Hassan said the human remains were taken to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary.
