The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) is on the spot over a revelation that it has restricted the number of dialysis sessions for kidney patients to just two times weekly or eight in a month. This is certainly bad news for theÂ Kenyans suffering from this condition and their families. The NHIF says it will seek pre-authorisation from hospitals before settling claims for any extra dialysis session(s) above its prescribed limit. It attributes this development to soaring claims for dialysis services. Last year alone, it paid out claims amounting to Sh840 million for 86,776 dialysis sessions. KIDNEY PROBLEMSThis means that hundreds of thousands of patients in need of dialysis now have to bear the cost of any extra session they get as prescribed by their doctors or live with their pain. The rise in claims for dialysis could be a pointer to the fact that the number of Kenyans with kidney problems is increasing. Indeed, data from the health sector shows that the number now stands at over four million. This points to a crisis in the health sector that calls for an appropriate response. Limiting the number of times a patient should access life-enhancing procedures such as dialysis is certainly not the way to deal with it. If anything, it amounts to forsaking the patients in their very hour of need. Let the NHIF seek more humane ways of taming the soaring claims for dialysis, without necessarily aggravating the plight of kidney patients.
