The first Nakuru goat auction has netted Sh6 million. The auction, which took place on Wednesday, saw farmers sell 500 goats. The event, which was organised by the county government, was held at Banita market in Rongai sub-county. The event dubbed “Nakuru County Easter Goat Auction” was officiated by Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui and his deputy Dr Eric Korir. During the auction, farmers sold their livestock at a standard price of Sh10,000 per animal, double price in the normal market. The governor said he had been sent by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to buy goats on their behalf. IMPROVE QUALITY President Kenyatta and his deputy bought 200 goats and 100 goats respectively at a total cost of Sh3 million. Nakuru County Executive for Agriculture Dr Immaculate Maina said the auction would improve the quality of livestock kept by farmers. “We want to ensure that going forward, the farmers raise their livestock with the market in their mind. This will guarantee good quality in the animals they bring in the coming years,” said Dr Maina. She said that in 2017, the county sold 174 metric tons of goats at Sh70 million. Dr Maina added that the county government was working to scale up the market for cattle to boost the residents’ living standards. SEMI-ARID REGION Governor Kinyanjui said Banita market was picked for the goat auction because it is in a semi-arid region animal husbandry does well here. “To ensure that farmers from this side reap from their kind of farming, we have decided to launch an annual goat auction,” said Mr Kinyanjui. He said that the auction, which would be held annually every week before Easter, would target the whole county. “We want to help the residents to keep more cattle. We want to show the whole country that Nakuru has more to offer,” added the governor.   The annual event will be on for two days.
