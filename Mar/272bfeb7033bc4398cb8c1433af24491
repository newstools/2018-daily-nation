National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale has termed as far-fetched complaints being made by non-native teachers seeking transfers from Wajir, Mandera and Garissa counties. “As a leader from the region, I know how welcoming we are and I will not allow teachers who are seeking transfers to smear an entire community,” the Garissa Township MP said. “If you want a transfer, do not raise claims that have no basis.” EXPERIENCES Since the February 16 attack by suspected al-Shabaab fighters at Qarsa Primary School in Wajir County, non-local tutors in Wajir and Mandera counties have been camping at the Teachers Service Commission headquarters in Nairobi demanding to be transferred to safer regions. On Thursday, teachers working in Mandera narrated to the National Assembly Education committee harrowing experiences at the hands of students, head teachers and education administrators. They cited insecurity, sexual harassment, religious and gender discrimination and unfair labour practices. Mr Duale said the allegations were insincere and far-fetched.   Knut Secretary Noor Bardad says that by Saturday, over 200 teachers had been transferred.
