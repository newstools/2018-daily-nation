Former AFC Leopards coach Robert Matano wants the club to pay him Sh4.9 million for wrongful dismissal. The veteran coach, who led Ingwe to the 2017 GOtv Shield, has now sued the club and is demanding compensation of up to Sh4.9 million following his sacking on March 13 after a poor run of performances. In a letter addressed to the club by Kiplagat and Company Advocates, Matano wants the 13-time Kenyan Premier League (KPL) champions compensate him within seven days of notice. “His termination was substantially and procedurally unfair contrary to Employment Act (2007),” said the notice seen by Nation Sport. Matano joined the team in July 2017 on an initial six months contract and helped save the side from relegation before signing a new two-year deal in January. The veteran trainer accused the club officials of failing to meet his demands that partly contributed to his suspension before he was sacked. "They are saying I did not perform and yet I asked the chairman to sign Masoud (Juma), Kepha (Aswani) and Timothy (Otieno) at the start of this season. He claimed these players were very expensive," he said in an earlier interview. Club secretary general Oscar Igaida had accused Matano of "high-handedness, disrespecting the management and failing to achieve initial targets set out at the start of this season." His successor, Tanzanian Dennis Kitambi has since won four games on the trot.   Leopards fired Matano in a development that sparked an ugly spat between the two parties.
