Teachers have demanded the withdrawal of textbooks provided by the government to students in secondary schools over errors and misleading facts. Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) and Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) said the errors must be corrected before students can continue using the books. Kuppet Secretary-General Akelo Misori blamed the errors on the hurried way the books were published. His Knut counterpart Wilson Sossion blamed the government for the mess. “We asked them to go slow on the programme but no one listened,” said Mr Sossion. However, Kenya Publishers Association chairman Lawrence Njagi defended publishers, saying a few errors should not be used to condemn the books. KICD deputy director of research Cyril Oyuga admitted that the books have errors and asked parents with capacity to consider buying their children other books. Errors have been identified in Kiswahili, English, Physics, Mathematics and Biology textbooks and some teachers have stopped using them.
