The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has assured motorists and commuters the Mto wa Mawe bridge in Athi River is safe.This is in a response to reports that the ongoing heavy rains and consequent flooding had weakened the bridge rendering it unsafe.Speaking during the inspection of repairs and the construction of an additional bridge on River Athi, KeNHA director of development David Muchilwa said only negligible damages had occurred.“The bridge’s main structure and structural pillars are still firm. The bridge can hold for up to 50 years or more based on our technical calculations,” said the engineer.
