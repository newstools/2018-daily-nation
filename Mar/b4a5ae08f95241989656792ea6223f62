The Kenya National Union of Teachers and the Teachers Service Commission on Friday traded accusations when a meeting they were to hold at the Ministry of Labour aborted. Knut Secretary-General Wilson Sossion, termed the development unacceptable and threatened to call for the removal of TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia, its chairman and commissioners "for failing to address labour disputes affecting teachers". GRIEVANCES “We are sending a caution to TSC board members and the commissioners. If they do not handle our grievances, we will demand that they step down,” Mr Sossion said. According to Knut, the employer failed to address serious issues affecting teachers which made the union register its concerns with the Ministry of Labour. However, TSC Head of Corporate Communication Kihumba Kamotho denied the claims, saying commission officials arrived at the meeting venue by 9.30am "but neither the reconcilitor nor the Knut officials were present". “The false utterances are unfortunate and a demonstration of bad faith even before the commencement of the engagement,” Mr Kamotho said. TRANSFER The teachers want TSC to withdraw performance appraisals and contract documents, stop transfer of tutors away from their homes and start promoting those that have acquired new qualifications.   Kuppet says the errors must be corrected before students can continue using the books.
