Kenya may have failed to qualify for the 2018 Fifa World Cup but a Kenyan is set to feature prominently in the world football extravaganza in Russia. Aden Marwa, has been shortlisted among match officials who will officiate in the June-July tournament. He is designated as an assistant referee. Marwa, 41, will be hoping to be assigned a game unlike in 2014 in Brazil when he made the list but saw no action. Marwa featured in the 2011 Fifa Under-17 World Cup as a centre referee. Over the last 15 years, the mathematics and chemistry teacher at Komotobo Secondary School in Migori County has put together a glittering resume that is an object of envy among his fellow match officials. Having served as a Fifa referee from 2011, Marwa was named as a reserve official at the 2014 World Cup, before being called up as an assistant referee at the 2016 Club World Cup in Japan. Marwa was also named as Caf assistant referee in the 2017 Fifa Confederations Cup where he served alongside Bakary Gassama, Jean-Claude Birumushahu and Malang Diedhiou. The three are amongst Africa’s most experienced and decorated referees. On the continental front, Marwa featured as an assistant referee in the 2012 and 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. Ahead of his last appearance at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, Marwa had officiated in three other continental finals – in 2012, 2013 and 2015, as well as at Chan (African Nations Cup) tournaments, Under-17 World Cup, CAF Under-23 Championship and the Fifa Club World Cup. Marwa became the first Kenyan to be chosen to officiate in the Fifa World Cup - 2014 Brazil - but many Kenyans got disappointed when he was not assigned any game to handle.
