A mob on Tuesday lynched two brothers suspected of killing a boda boda after robbing him of his motorcycle on Monday night. Lugari OCPD Benedict Mwangangi said the body of 23-year-old Timothy Kigame was found in a farm. Kigame hailed from Kewa village in Marakusi Sub-County. The killers tied the rider's hands and covered his mouth with a masking tape. NO INJURIES The two brothers aged 24 and 27 from Pan Paper area were beaten by boda bodas who accused them of killing their colleague. Mr Mwangangi said the rider could have been murdered elsewhere and his body dumped in the farm. “The body did not have visible injuries but he appears to have been hit on the head with a blunt object. We have taken the body to the mortuary,” the police chief said. The mob then burnt four houses, destroying property of unknown value. CALL UNASWERED The police chief said villagers who had gone to work on their farms stumbled on the body and raised alarm. “The killers must have been attracted to the rider’s new motorcycle. He was last seen on Sunday at 7pm when he took some shopping to his family,” Mr Mwangangi said. Kigame’s mother Gladys Mmbone said she tried to call him at 9pm when he failed to return home but the phone went unanswered. WORRIED “I got worried when the phone was switched off at midnight,” Ms Mmbone said. “When I woke up in the morning, a neighbour called to tell me my son was dead.” Lugari MP Ayub Savula said there would be a meeting on Friday in Pan Paper to address insecurity.
