A contingent of police officers have roughed up lawyers James Orengo, Julie Soweto, Nelson Havi and Cliff Ombeta at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The lawyers were also kicked out of the airport as they tried to serve the Immigration Department with court orders. Journalists were also ordered out of JKIA. On Tuesday, Mr Orengo and Otiende Amollo stuck court orders demanding the release of Dr Miguna Miguna at the Immigration Department's offices at JKIA. Mr Orengo, on Tuesday, said they pinned the court orders at "conspicuous places", saying no official was present to receive them. Earlier Tuesday, Justice Roselyn Aburili had instructed the government to release Dr Miguna, who is being detained at the airport. MISTREATMENT The directive was issued after Dr Miguna's lawyers (John Khaminwa, Havi and Soweto) sued the government over the matter. The lawyers complained about mistreatment of Dr Miguna by security officers, claiming that he had not been allowed to communicate with anyone. The Law Society of Kenya joined them in criticising the government over the handling of the National Super Alliance member. MATIANG'I CONVICTED Earlier on Wednesday, High Court Judge George Odunga had convicted Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i, Inspector General Joseph Boinnet and Immigration Director Gordon Kihalangwa for contempt of court. Justice Odunga summoned them to appear in court 10am Thursday for sentencing. . The judge also ordered that National Super Alliance activist Mr Miguna Miguna be released from detention, at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, unconditionally.   Miguna condemned Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, Mr Boinnet and Immigration PS Kihalangâ€™wa.
