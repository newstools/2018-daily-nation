Shareholders of Kiru Tea Factory Company have kicked out the managing director of listed firm Sasini Tea #ticker:SASN from their board for conflict of interest amid opposition from the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA). Stephen Githiga, the Group MD of Sasini, was ousted following an extra ordinary meeting on Monday that was declared unprocedural by the KTDA. The High Court In January rejected Mr Githiga’s plea to stop Kiru Tea Factory Company from axing him and ruled that director fights should be settled in the boardroom, setting the stage for his ejection. Shareholders accused the KTDA, which manages the factory, of taking sides in the dispute after circulating notices stopping the extra ordinary meeting and locking famers out of the factory premises. “There will be no special general meeting of Kiru Tea Factory or any other meeting in respect of the company” said Kennedy Omanga, KTDA company secretary ahead of the Monday meeting.
