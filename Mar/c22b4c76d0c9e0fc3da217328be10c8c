Four people were missing after their lorry was swept away on Thursday by flooded River Enziu in Mwingi East, Kitui County. Eyewitness Kithome Musya said the lorry got stuck as it was driven across the river and the men tried to push it out. FLOOD But the water swept them away. "They jumped on top of the lorry to save their lives but it was too late since the same lorry was overturned by the water and we witnessed four of them being swept by the river,‚Äù he said. One of the men tried his best to cling onto the lorry, but he was swept away. Mr Musya said the men could not be saved as it was raining heavily, the area was flooded and the river had burst its banks. CAUTIONThe rain began on Wednesday night and only subsided to a drizzle at midday on Thursday. Transport has been disrupted as the heavy rain rendered many roads impassable. Mwingi Central police boss John Nyamu could not confirm the number of people drowned in River Enziu but promised to give more information when he confirms the details. He urged residents to avoid crossing rivers when it is raining. Mr Nyamu also asked residents to be careful when water levels rise. On Wednesday, a woman and a seven-year-old boy drowned as they tried to cross Ikinye River in Mwingi. Last week one man drowned in Tyaa River.
