Three National Super Alliance (Nasa) co-principals on Friday claimed they were not privy to the discussions between coalition leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. In a joint statement, Mr Kalonzo Musyoka, Mr Musalia Mudavadi and Mr Moses Wetang’ula said they learnt of it through the media. MEETING “This morning the 9th day of March 2018 we saw through the media a meeting between The President and Rt. Hon. Raila Amolo Odinga. “Nasa is a coalition of four political parties namely, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper Democratic Movement-Kenya (WDM-K), Amani National Congress (ANC) and Ford Kenya,” the three said in the statement. They went on to state that they, together with Mr Odinga, would deliberate on the Friday happenings in a planned retreat. “While we have always advocated for dialogue, as co-principals of the Nasa coalition, we were not privy to the discussions at Harambee House. “The four Nasa co-principals have, however, scheduled a retreat on Monday 12th March, 2018 when we shall deliberate on the political developments,” the statement concluded. Mr Odinga met Mr Kenyatta at Harambee House on Friday morning and they later released statements indicating their willingness to put aside their differences and work for the benefit of Kenyans.   President and Nasa leader agree to unite Kenyans.
