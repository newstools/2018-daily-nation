Veteran farmer-cum-politician Jackson Kibor has sued his two sons and the Attorney-General for what he terms malicious charges they brought against him. Through his lawyer, Stanley Kagunza, Mr Kibor filed the case at the Eldoret law courts, accusing his two sons, Evans Kipkosgei Kibor and Ezekiel Kiprotich Kibor of subjecting him to malicious prosecution. CASE Mr Kibor’s sons had sued him for allegedly threatening to kill them using his gun in their family farm in Uasin Gishu County on March 7 last year. But last week, Eldoret Principal Magistrate Naomi Wairimu dropped the case against Mr Kibor, prompting him to sue the sons and the AG. Mr Kibor claims that the charges tarnished his reputation, portraying him as a killer. “My client’s character was assassinated following the charges which were preferred against him. The case subjected him to psychological torture,” says Mr Kagunza. He further told the court that his client spent over Sh800,000 as legal fees and other expenses during the court proceedings. The defendants are yet to file their responses. Two weeks ago, Mr Kibor’s youngest wife Eunita Kibor sued the Standard newspaper for defamation, alleging that the paper referred to her as a gold digger. She is demanding an apology and compensation for alleged damages arising from the story published online She accuses the paper and its writer of printing and publishing the article that portrayed her as “a money-oriented” woman taking advantage of her elderly rich husband’s wealth. Mr Kibor owns multiple business ventures, more than 3,000 acres of land and other property in the Rift Valley region.   Video of the purported shooting circulates on social media.
