Kenya Volleyball Federation National League men's champions GSU beat Wolaitta of Ethiopia 3-1 sets in their second match at the ongoing African Volleyball Club Championship at Ahly Hall in Cairo, Egypt. The paramilitary outfit won 25-16, 24-26, 25-17 and 25-15 in their pool D tie to make it two wins on the trot on Wednesday. After comfortably taking the opening set, the Kenyan side allowed their opponents to hit back in a thrilling second set and level the contest. However, GSU inspired by right attacker Abiud Chirchir would go on to claim the next two sets to complete the emphatic win as their opponents collapsed. The Moses Epolot-coached side had started their campaign with an emphatic 3-1 sets ( 20-25, 25-15, 26-24, 25-17) win over favourites Olympique of Algeria on Tuesday evening. After Olympique won the first set, the Kenyan team rebounded back to win three consecutive sets to finish match in optimum show. A win in their third match against Cameroon's Port on Thursday will seal their place in the last eight with one match to spare. GSU, who are returning to the continental competition after missing in action last year in Tunisia, have trained their sights on reaching the competitionâ€™s semi-finals. The team's best performance was a bronze medal during the 1995 competition held in Benin. The team wound up 17th in their last appearance in 2016. Kenya Prisons, who are the country's other representatives in the competition, also won the first match against Lesotho's Redskin on Tuesday. Prions face Congo's Espoir on Wednesday evening in their next match.   Kenyan champions recover from a set down to claim huge win.
