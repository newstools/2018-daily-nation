Nearly 10,000 Ethiopians fleeing a government crackdown in their country have crossed into Kenya in the past few days, creating a serious humanitarian crisis. The refugees, who are still arriving in the northern border town of Moyale, need immediate attention, food and temporary shelter. We commend the local authorities for their prompt action in receiving and looking after the visitors. It’s not just a humanitarian responsibility, it’s also an obligation the country cannot shun, being a signatory to international treaties to protect people fleeing persecution in their own countries. RESOURCESWe also appreciate the role being played by the Kenya Red Cross Society, an organisation that has the expertise and capacity to help ease the burden of looking after the visitors, who include women and children. Hosting refugees is something Kenya has become adept at, looking after hundreds of thousands of Somalis for several decades now. But it’s a responsibility that comes with a number of challenges. The most immediate is quickly mobilising the resources to look after the refugees, who arrive with almost nothing apart from the clothes they are wearing and a few portable belongings. INSECURITYThe biggest challenge is that of potential insecurity. There is a possibility of criminals infiltrating asylum seekers. Some could be spies; terrorists could also take advantage of the crisis to enter the country. There is a need for vigilance, but the screening to isolate the crooks is a delicate task. It must be carried out with sensitivity, to protect the rights of the refugees. The international community must not leave this burden to Kenya alone, as it is too early to tell when it will be safe enough for the refugees to return home.
