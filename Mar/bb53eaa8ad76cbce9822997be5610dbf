Kenya Volleyball Federation men's champions GSU on Friday stormed the quarter-finals of the ongoing African Volleyball Club championship after beating Uganda's Kampala Amateurs 3-0 at the Al Ahly Sports Hall in Cairo, Egypt. The paramilitary side secured a straight sets win of 25-16, 25-21, 25-20 over the neighbours to become the first team to enter the quarterfinals of the event that has attracted 24 teams. This was GSU’s fourth win of the tournament after triumphs over Port of Cameroon, Woaitta of Ethiopia and Algeria’s Olympique in their previous group games. GSU will now face Engluish of Egypt in the final group match on Saturday as they explore their chances of clinching the tournament’s title for the first time in history. “As we move on in the competition, the level of opposition becomes stronger, so we have to dig very deep I every match in order to win. Our target is to reach the semi-final's, and I am glad we are still on track,” said GSU coach Gideon Tarus from Cairo on Friday. In a later match played at the same venue, Kenya Prisons bounced back from Thursday’s 3-0 loss to Al Ahly to beat Cote d’Ivoire’s Police by straight sets. Prisons went off to a 25-15 win in the first set, but had to dig deeper in the second set which they won 25-19. A series of relentless and well-orchestrated attacks however gave the Ivorians no chance in the third set, as the prison warders ended up tying it up on a 25-18 victory. Prions can seal their place in the quarterfinals with a win against Uganda's Nemostar in their final pool A encounter on Saturday. The men’s tournament comes just a week after the women’s edition which was played at the same venue, where hosts Al Ahly reclaimed their title after trouncing Carthage of Tunisia by straight sets. Kenya Pipeline finished third after edging domestic rivals Kenya Prisons in the third place playoffs.   Ahly swept past Kenya Prisons 25-12, 25-18 and 25-17
