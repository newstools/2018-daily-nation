The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee has endorsed the nomination of Noordin Mohamed Haji as Director of Public Prosecutions. During his vetting on Monday, Mr Haji said if he gets the position he will fairly prosecute criminals. "It is true that the 'big fish' have money and can afford good lawyers to represent them and delay their cases for a long time and eventually justice is not served. I will have a meeting with the Judiciary to address this," Mr Haji said. One of the strategies he plans to employ is the rotation of prosecutors handling the cases of prominent personalities. The position became vacant after Mr Keriako Tobiko was appointed to head the Environment and Forestry docket.
