One of the most shocking images from the rains wreaking havoc across the country is the washed away portion of the Mai Mahiu-Narok highway. It more than dramatizes the destruction by floods, which have claimed a number of lives already. The motorists who were stranded should count themselves lucky as they did not suffer the fate of the schoolgirl swept away by the floodwaters on Tuesday night. It is, indeed, a pity that people who have spent a lot of time praying for the rain as drought raged, end up becoming victims of an uncontrollable deluge. TRAFFIC POLICEAccording to the Kenya National Highways Authority, a fault line stretching for 200 metres on the busy road six kilometres from Narok Town cut it off. Fortunately, many buses and private motor vehicles heeded an alert by traffic police to use alternative routes and were spared. This is not the first time a major highway has been cut off by rains. Several years ago, it happened on the Mombasa highway but help came from the military, which installed a temporary bridge to enable the resumption of traffic as repairs were carried out. There is a need to build the capacity to stem the vagaries of natural calamities. The speedy response from the roads agency, which has started temporary repairs, is proof that with better organisation the consequences of natural disasters can be minimised.
