A 42-year-old man from Kieganguru Village, Tharaka-Nithi County, is admitted in hospital after he attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a kitchen knife. The carpenter, who works at a coffin workshop in Chogoria Town, was saved by members of the public who alerted police officers. ATTEMPTED ESCAPE He was rushed to PCEA Chogoria Mission Hospital in critical condition. Speaking to the Nation, hospital manager Mary Gitonga said the patient had lost a lot of blood. “The patient has a deep cut in the neck but we managed to contain the bleeding and he is currently undergoing treatment,” she said. Ms Gitonga said that after being admitted in hospital, the man tried to escape but was caught by the hospital guards leaving through the main gate. BLEEDING PROFUSELY Maara police boss Johnston Kabusia said that when they received the report that the man had slit his throat, officers rushed to the scene and found him bleeding profusely. "When we searched him, we found a kitchen knife with blood stains in his pocket,” said Mr Kabusia. The officer said residents reported that before the incident he was heard asking his young son how he would react if he died. Mr Kabusia said they were yet to establish why the man attempted to kill himself. PROBLEMS The police boss encouraged members of the public to share their problems with close friends to avoid such incidences. "A shared problem is always half solved because other people can help with a solution or encourage you to seek advice from a counsellor,” he said. Mr John Mutegi, a town resident, said he was surprised when he heard of the attempted suicide because the carpenter was a happy and hardworking man.
