Former Riruta Ward Rep, who has been charged with killing his estranged wife had accused her of infidelity, a witness told the court. Mr Samwel Ndung’u had also threatened to kill a man he suspected was having an illicit affair with Lucy Njambi, Lydia Nduta, a witness, told the court on Monday. SMS Ms Nduta said Mr Ndung'u had sent her son, Samwel Kìiru, 22, threatening text messages for allegedly having an affair with Ms Njambi. In one of the messages, he allegedly said, "Hey kazee, unaita bibi ya wenyewe bae?  Let's meet in heaven". The incident was reported to Gatundu Police Station where Mr Ndung’u was summoned. After the meeting, Nduta said Mr Ndung’u knelt down and with his hands raised he said, "I swear, I will kill him even if I will be jailed". Njambi, 24, died in January after she was physically assaulted and forced to swallow acid that her attackers later doused her with. Njambi had been living in a rented apartment with her four-year-old son for a month after moving out of her husband’s house in Lavington following a family dispute. A witness said she was abducted at night by Mr Ndung’u and others from her apartment in Thindigua, Kiambu County, and driven to an unknown destination. She would later be found abandoned near a coffee plantation at Kamiti Corner in Ruiru, naked and badly burnt. A Good Samaritan took her to Kiambu Level Four Hospital, where she narrated her ordeal to police officers. She said her husband and three others had assaulted her, raped her and doused her body with an unknown substance. She died at Kenyatta National Hospital, hours after she had been referred there from the Kiambu hospital. Mr Ndung’u and two others have been charged with her murder.
