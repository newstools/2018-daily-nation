It’s the height of irony in a country where many people had no food just recently that hundreds of farmers in the North Rift are stuck with their harvest. The explanation that the National Cereals and Produce Board cannot buy more because its silos are full must be the joke of the year. It simply means that this agency, whose mandate is to buy cereals from farmers for the national strategic grain reserve, does not take this key responsibility seriously enough. For the farmers, all the efforts that went into producing the crops — the investment in cultivation, inputs, weeding and harvesting — could just go to waste. After all, the alternative market, which is private dealers and individuals, is not adequate, especially just after harvest, when there is plenty of produce. It is through the agency that farmers avoid having to sell at a throwaway price. At the height of the recent acute food shortage, the Agriculture ministry released some stocks from the reserve; so, how can the NCPB silos be full? Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri’s explanation that farmers delivered more than had been anticipated by the government does not make sense. Should farmers be punished for their efficiency? Mr Kiunjuri should quickly enable the NCPB to mobilise more funds and expand its storage to take in the entire harvest in this region and elsewhere in the country.
