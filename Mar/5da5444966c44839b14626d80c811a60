The pair of Kenya Golf Union (KGU) chairman Richard Wanjalla and Italian pro Alessandro Tadini produced an impressive nine under par 45 points at the long playing Muthaiga Golf Club course, to claim the overall prize in the first Kenya Open pro-am tournament on Monday. The two birdied a number of holes particularly at the front nine in the tough playing course, to beat the pair of Sweden's Magnus Carlson and T.Cege as well as David Law and amateur Ben Gaithuma on countback. The quartet had carded 24 points in the back nine, though a par finish at the 18th by Wanjalla saw them finish off better in the last six holes. Whilst the amateurs collected take-away prizes, the three pros in the tying teams each took 300 Euros (Sh 37,225). There was five way countback with seven under par 43 in each of the five teams, where the pros won 20 Euros (Sh 2,481) each. A total of 60 pairs participated in the Kenya Open Golf Limited sponsored tourney, which will be followed by the second pro-am Wednesday at the same venue, where a total of 14 local pros will be in action. Speaking after his round, the KGU boss Wanjalla said he was delighted after emerging the winner of the pro-am. "We combined well with my pro whose individual score was also very impressive. It would have been even better if I did not scratch one hole at the back nine," said Wanjalla.   A field of 176 pros and local amateurs will be up as early as 7.50am.
