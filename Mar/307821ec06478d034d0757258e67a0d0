Kisumu’s Palos Ladies FC on Saturday beat Nairobi’s Soccer Queens FC 2-1 in a thrilling Kenya Women Premier League clash at Mbaraki Sports Club in Mombasa. The game got off to a quick pace, with Queens looking the better side and deservedly took an early lead in the third minute when Nuru Katsele teed up Esther Dhiramo to beat an onrushing Palos goalkeeper Mercy Nyaranga with a well-calculated shot. Palos fought back and scored through Cynthia Achieng who shot past goalkeeper Iny Makhoha. In the second half, Palos scored the match winner with a minute to the final whistle. Catherine Nasibwa teamed up with Winnie Akelo to set up Elizabeth Akinyo to fire home. In a National Super Leaguemath played earlier at the same venue, Coast Stima held Modern Coast Rangers FC to a 1-1 draw.
