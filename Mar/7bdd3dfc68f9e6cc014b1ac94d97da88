Justus Soget ,who won the 3,000m at IAAF Muller World Indoor Grand prix meeting in Glasgow last Sunday, received a hero’s welcome at Kirobon High School on the outskirts of Nakuru on Tuesday. Normal school activities at the learning institution situated along Nakuru – Eldoret highway were brought to a standstill as jubilant teachers and students welcomed their hero back to school. Motorists along the busy highway slowed down to catch a glimpse of the young champion. Dancing students carried Soget shoulder high and garlanded him with flowers. The students carried posters bearing the words ‘Welcome back home world champion; You’re our hero, Kirobon Boys champion you’re the best.’ Students from the neighbouring Kirobon Girls High School joined in the celebrations. “I went to Glasgow for the win,” said Soget. “I wasn’t expecting a big welcome ceremony such as this, but I ‘m glad I got it. I promise my colleagues and my teachers that the sky is the limit,” said Soget. School Principal Barnabas Kitili, who is also his coach, could not hide his joy. “Soget has done Kirobon High School proud,” said Kitilit. Soget narrated how he had told his roommate Bethwel Birgen, who was running in the 1,500m, that he would run the "race of his life".
