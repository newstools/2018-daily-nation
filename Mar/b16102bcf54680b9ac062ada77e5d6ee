Germany’s Max Schmitt fired his way to the top of the leaderboard after a brilliant round of six under par on the second day of the 2018 Barclays Kenya Open at Muthaiga Golf Club. Starting the second round on four under 67, Schmitt rolled in a total of seven birdies for the day with only a bogey at the par five-10th. Playing a conservative first nine, he made seven pars with only two birdies at the fourth, and seventh holes both par five. Schmitt however went for birdie hunting at the back nine after his three putts at the 10th, picked two back-to-back birdies at the 11th and 12th and at the 14th and 15th.   He made a birdie-par finish for a fine 65 and a two rounds total of 10 under par 132, to take a two shots lead from Norway’s Johannessen Kristian Krogh. “It was a perfect round. I had just the one bogey which wasn’t nice, but I came back with a lot of birdies after that so I am quite pleased right now," said Schmitt. “It's really great to be leading. I am really excited for the next two days as I don’t think the first two days could have got any better," added Schmitt.     BOGEYED TWO HOLES Johannessen bogeyed two holes at the sixth and eighth and the front nine, with a birdie at the seventh though an eagle 10th to start the back nine, saw him picking up three birdies at the 12th and 13th and a late one at the 18th for a second round 67 and a two rounds total of 134. Also making a move to the top with a brave six under par 65 was 2016 Kenya Open champion Sebastian Soderberg from Sweden whose eight birdies cancelled the two bogeys he had on eighth and 12th for a total of 135 with his compatriot Simon Forsstrom joining him at third place. Forsstrom made birdies on the second, 10th, 15th and 18th, after dropping a shot earlier at the par fourth, eighth and at the 14th hole for the day’s two under par 69. TOUGH DAY FOR KELLETT It was a tough day for joint round one leader Scotland’s Ross Kellett, who made only one birdie for the day with three bogeys to drop to four under par 138. With two rounds to go, he can still mount a come back campaign and so are players like Michael Hoey of Northern Ireland and Joel Stalter of France. The two shot one over par 72 and level par 71 respectively. The leaderboard: 132 Max Schmitt (Ger) 67, 65 134 Johannessen Kristian-Krogh (Nor) 67, 67 135 Simon Forsstrom (Swe) 66, 69 135 Sebastian Soderberg 70, 65 136 Max Orrin (Eng) 65, 71 136 Anton Karlsson (Swe) 69, 67 136 Lorenzo Gagli (Ita) 68, 68 136 Justin Walters(SA) 68, 68   The duo of Erick Ooko and Greg Snow missed the cut by just a shot.
