Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) has advertised positions of almost all its senior managers, barely two days after they were demoted. In a notice on Monday, the corporation said interested and qualified candidates must complete the Kenya Railways application form, attach their testimonials and certificates on applications. “Only shortlisted candidates will be contacted. Canvasing will lead to automatic disqualification,” said the notice. Some of the senior management positions that have been announced include administration, assistant architect, audit control, assistant board services, assistant property administration, corporate affairs and public relations managers. The sudden restructuring, which is linked to the poor performance of the standard gauge railway, saw long serving finance manager Alfred Matheka reassigned as finance controller, corporate affairs manager Mary Oyuke was reassigned as assistant corporate affairs manager, while ICT manager  Ibrahim Mwadime was named assistant ICT manager.
