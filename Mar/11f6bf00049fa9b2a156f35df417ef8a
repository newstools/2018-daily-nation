The theme of the event is ‘promoting innovation and technology in agriculture and trade’ and seeks to empower farmers with various technologies to enable them to address challenges. Key exhibitors are Kenya Seed Company, Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (Kephis) and Kenya Livestock and Research Organisation, among others. Agriculture Chief Administrative Secretary, Dr Andrew Tuimur, said the ministry was working with various stakeholders to address the extension services gap. “We will involve researchers as well as students from various universities to support farmers. Through this support, we believe it will help improve the country’s food security,” he said. Dr Tuimur said the pilot project will target nine counties in the North Rift and western Kenya that include Kakamega, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu. The country faces an acute shortage of extension officers, with farmers noting that some of them were not acquainted with the latest technologies. The ASK North Rift’s chairman Radcliffe Nangalama said this year’s show has witnessed an increase in the number of exhibitors from 120 last year to over 200. “Last year we had over 120 stands, this year we are almost approaching 200 from various exhibitors both local and international,” said Nangalama.   The theme of the fair is "Enhancing technology in Agriculture and Industry for food security and national growth."
