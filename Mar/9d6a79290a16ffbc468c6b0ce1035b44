Owners of residential and commercial buildings in Mombasa’s Central Business District have been ordered to paint their premises. In a notice, the county government has directed that all buildings be painted white with blue (Egyptian shade blue) border. The owners have been given 14 days to comply. “The buildings should be in white with Egyptian blue border on the edges and windows above without any sign written on the wall or canopy,” reads in part the notice signed by Transport, Infrastructure and Public Works Executive Tawfiq Balala. The owners are also required to clean walk ways of their premises. “We will take those who will not comply to court. Collect compliance letter on completion by attaching photos before and after as a proof of evidence to support the compliance,” adds the letter. The directive comes two weeks after the county engaged residents in a public forum on the implementation of the policy.
