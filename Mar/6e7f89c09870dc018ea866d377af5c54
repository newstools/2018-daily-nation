Armed gangsters have shot dead the chairman of Kitale Golf Club, Brigadier (Rtd) Moses Yator and stolen cash and other valuables from him. The 68-year-old Mr Yator was on his way home from the Kitale Golf Club at around 11pm on Saturday when armed men laid an ambush before shooting him from the rear window. "After I left the club the chairman was finishing his dinner at around 10.23pm. I arrived at 10.33pm and that was when I received a call that he has been shot," Patrice Tomno, the club’s captain told the Nation by phone. Mr Tomno was the last person to see the club chairman and the first person to be at the scene of the shooting. FORCED TO STOP Mr Yator’s wife, Esther Nandutu, said that they left the club a few minutes to 11pm and as they approached home, three men emerged from a thicket and forced them to stop. "One commanded us to alight from the vehicle and hand over all our belongings. Immediately my husband identified himself as a security officer. Within a minute a shot was fired from behind the car and he started screaming in pain," she narrated. She recalled that immediately after her husband was shot the gang dragged him in front of their vehicle's headlights as if they were confirming something before ordering her to come out and lie on top of him as they escaped. MONEY, PHONES STOLEN Trans Nzoia County Police Commander Samson ole Kine confirmed the incident adding that the gang robbed the couple Sh25,000 plus two mobile phones before fleeing from the scene. "We suspect the gun used to shoot him from the back was an assault rifle suspected to be an AK-47," he said. He said that live ammunition and a spent cartridge were recovered at the scene. "We have extensively combed the area in search of the culprits as investigations are underway," he added. The body was taken to Cherangany Nursing Home mortuary.
