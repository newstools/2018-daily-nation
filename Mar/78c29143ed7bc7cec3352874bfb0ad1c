Alfred Barkach and Cellphine Chespol orchestrated Kenya’s 1-2 finish in senior men and women’s races as the fifth Africa Cross Country Championships went down on Saturday in Chlef, Algeria. It was a sprint finish in the last lap between Barkach and compatriot Julius Kogo as they waylaid Ugandan Thomas Ayeko to the men’s 10km race victory. Barkach, who finished second during the National Championships that doubled up as the trials for the Championships, clocked 30 minutes and 47 seconds for his maiden major victory, beating Kogo, who settled for silver in 30:47. Ayeko settled for bronze, clocking 30:47 followed by Ethiopian Enyew Mekonnen in 31:01. Another Kenyan Emmanuel Bor clocked 31:14 to settle fifth and seal the team title for Kenya. Last year’s silver medallist Philip Kipyeko from Uganda timed 31:19 to finish a distant sixth. “It was tight race but I had to be tactical to win the race. My success was all about good training him to win,” said Barkach. Chespol, the reigning World Cross Country junior bronze medallist, braved a mix up in the last lap after she fell to to win senior women’s 10km race in 35.10 as Africa 5,000m champion Margaret Chelimo completed Kenya’s 1-2 feat in 35:13. Ethiopia’s Yeshi Kalayu claimed the last podium place in 35:26 as other Kenyans, national champion Stacy Ndiwa (35:27) and Sandra Chebet (35:47) finished fourth and sixth as Kenya retained senior women’s title. Chespol, who is also the World Junior 3,000m steeplechase champion, broke in the third lap with Rosemary Njeri in tow. There was confusion when Chespol thought that she had finished the race only for the officials to ask her to continue with the race. “The competition was very tough. I almost ruined my race when thought I was in the last lap. I liked the course because it was designed for cross country,” said Chespol after her first victory as a senior. Ronex Kipruto and Stanley Waithaka ensured a Kenyan 1-2 feat in the junior men’s 8km race after they surged ahead of the pack early on. Kipruto crossed the tape in 25:01 followed by Waithaka in 25:06 as Ethiopian Solomon Berihu came in third 25:08. Vincent Ng’etich, Edwin Bett, Edward Zakayo and Dominic Rotich were in sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth position respectively to seal the team title. Ethiopian athletes Girmawit Gebru (20:40) and Tsige Selama (20:54) took the first and second position in junior women’s 6km race. Kenya’s Hellen Ekalale (20:55) settled third. Agnes Chebet (21:02), Roselidah Jepketer (21:04), Miriam Cherop (21:06), and Edinah Jebitok (21:21) were in fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth positions respectively. In the mixed relays category, Ethiopian athletes were too strong for the Kenyans after winning in 23:52 with Kenya coming in second position clocking 24:15 ahead of Morocco - who timed 25:07.
