The onset of long rains has exposed the poor state of football facilities in Kenya, and players found themselves having to contend with almost unplayable pitches in the Kenyan Premier League and National Super League matches. At the weekend, heavy rains in Thika, Nakuru and Machakos meant that teams were forced to endure the treacherous, damp and soft pitches in matches. Thika Sub-county Stadium which hosted the league match between Mathare United and Thika United, was particularly treacherous, and was an eye sore to viewers who were following proceedings live on local free to air television channels. The playing surface was reduced to a muddy, bumpy pitch spotting small mounds of grass sparsely distributed across it. Still, the two sets of players played on, oblivious of the perils of slogging it out in the wet, soggy and slippery surface. It is at the same pitch that Gor Mahia right back Karim Nizigiyimana cracked his ankle last year, and had to undergo surgery. Gor left back Wellington Ochieng is also out for weeks, having injured his ankle in Machakos last week. The poor playing surface hinder talent development, and are a disturbing sight for photojournalists and television vedio cameramen struggling to capture the action. “Our style of play is about building from the back but we find it very hard especially when it rains. The pitches become slippery during rains, and one can easily pick an injury,” Thika coach Nicholas Muyoti said on Monday. Kenya is enduring a severe lack of playable fields, and the closure of Kasarani and Nyayo Stadium facilities for renovations coupled with doubleheaders has led to overuse of the remaining pitches, making them unplayable during rains.
