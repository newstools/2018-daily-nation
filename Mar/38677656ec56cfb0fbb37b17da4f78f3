Skipper Oscar Ouma squeezed in a low but hard try after the hooter as Kenya Sevens edged out France 14-7 to launch their Canada Sevens quest in style at BC Place, Vancouver on Saturday. There were anxious moments when Ouma scored the winning try since the decision had to come from the Television Match Official. The Pool "C" match proved tense but the dominant and physical Kenyans failed to spread the ball wide, running out of options as France defended well. France claimed a swift turnover against a fumbling Kenyan defence as Paulin Riva gave them a head start with a converted try. It took Billy Odhiambo and Ouma's breaks to restore some thrills into the match. Ouma's last pass to Dan Sikuta spilled over the tryline. France, who had beaten Kenya 19-14 at the same stage in the previous USA Sevens leg, led 7-0 at the break. POWERFUL Things changed when Andrew Amonde came in with Kenya getting to carry the ball forward. Samuel Oliech crushed through France defence to land before converting to level 7-7. William "Lomu" Ambaka, in his powerful trade mark burst, tore on the left flank but was brought down with five metres from the line. Ambaka picked the ball from the tackle to land but the TMO denied him the try. Kenya claimed the scrummage as bullish Ouma pinned down the winning try amid tackles from two French players. Oliech added the extras. Kenya play Spain at 12.46am on Sunday where victory will put them through to their fifth main Cup quarterfinal. Their last Pool match will be against New Zealand Sevens winners Fiji.
