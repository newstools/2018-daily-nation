BUENOS AIRES, An Argentine tax official reportedly made a one-letter change to their name — and legally changed gender from male to female — in a bid to gain another five years of retirement. Sergio, who was a divorced 59-year-old man, became Sergia under a law that allows a legal change of gender without undergoing sex reassignment surgery, the InformaSalta website reported. In Argentina, women can retire at age 60, but men have to wait until they are 65. "This is a clear case of abuse of misuse of retirement rights and of the law on gender identity," said Matias Assennato, the head of the Salta province civil registry.
