The move by Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa to reclaim grabbed land earmarked for sports facilities is laudable. This is long overdue and critical for sports development. One of the facilities, Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, has lost a large chunk of the 1000-acres set aside by government for its expansion. Grabbers have put up homes and commercial structures on the land, leaving little room for the stadium to grow. Various other stadiums across the country have suffered the same fate. It is for lack of facilities that a majority of sports teams continue to struggle in search of quality training venues and stadiums to play matches. Incidentally, the country’s biggest football clubs — AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia — are among the struggling sides, even though they were both allocated land at Kasarani for development by President Daniel arap Moi. Mr Echesa must rein in these land grabbers and ensure they are hauled before courts. Kenya’s reputation as home of top athletes can only be guarded if we have quality sporting facilities.
