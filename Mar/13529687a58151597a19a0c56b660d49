Champions Upper Hill on Saturday reached the finals of the basketball and rugby 15s competitions at the ongoing Nairobi Region Secondary Schools Term One Games. The city giants won their respective semis to remain on course to retain their titles and also qualify for next month’s National Term One Games in Embu. In rugby 15s, Upper Hill hit Dagoretti High School 17-6 to move into Sunday’s final at Nairobi School. Tries from Abdultalibu Wesonga, Pius Odera and Ashila Clement, who also converted his try, gave Upper Hill the victory. Dagoretti, who were looking to make it to the first final, scored two penalties through Timothy Lugale, but it was not enough to help them reach the final. The win saw Upper hill coach Thomas Walgwe get the better of his brother Victor Walgwe of Dagoretti. Thomas replaced his brother this year after the latter moved to Dagoretti. “It was a tough battle but our experience and composure won it for us in the end and I happy for the lads because they fought hard,” Thomas said. His brother, Victor said his charges paid the price of a poor start but was pleased with their performance. “There are a lot of positives to be taken from our performance and I think we have shown that we are a good side who are capable of competing with the big boys,” he said. Upper Hill will take on Lenana, who saw off Moi Forces Academy 17-10 in the other semi-final. Upper Hill saw off Langata High School in the quarters, as Dagoretti knocked out the hosts and last year’s finalists Nairobi School. In basketball, Upper Hill comfortably saw off Strathmore 58-12 in their semi-final. The former national champions led 21-1 in the first quarter, before extending their advantage to 14-5 in the second quarter. Upper Hill would outscore their opponents 18-2 and 5-4 in the third and fourth quarters. Upper Hill will lock horns with Dagoretti in the final as the three-day competition comes to an end.
