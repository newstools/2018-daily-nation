Financial services group Britam is set to lay off 100 staff in a bid to cut costs. The firm said on Wednesday that it was implementing an early retirement plan mean to enable the firm “to remain agile, relevant and responsive to the changing market conditions.” Its financial advisors will not be affected, it added. “The early retirement is part of our business realignment process that focuses on building and growing market leadership through greater efficiency driven by innovation and technological advancement,” said Britam Group managing director Benson Wairegi in a statement. Mr Wairegi did not respond to queries on sendoff packages, the criteria of the retirement plan as well as how much it will cost the company. Early this year Britam issued a profit warning for the year ended December 2017, becoming the ninth publicly traded firm to anticipate an earnings decline of at least 25 per cent. The firm said at the time that its net profit for the period would drop from the Sh2.4 billion it reported in the previous year, which benefited from the adoption of a new valuation system that depressed its liabilities.
