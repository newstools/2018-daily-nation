Four police officers have been accused of storming a shop in Kisauni, Mombasa, and stealing more than Sh60,000. The officers who were in civilian clothes reportedly got into the shop in Momani and beat up a shopkeeper and an M-Pesa attendant before stealing from them on Sunday night. ARRESTED The Sh60, 000 is said to have been taken from the M-Pesa shop and another unknown amount of money from the shopkeeper’s safe. The two shop attendants were then arrested by the officers and taken to Kiembeni Police Station. The shops are run by four people and when one of them went to report the matter at Nyali Police Station, he was arrested. The incident was recorded on OB number 04/26/03/18 at Nyali Police Station. The owner and the two shop attendants were released on Monday night. A video clip obtained by the Nation shows a man being ejected from the shop. A voice is heard in the clip saying, “Kwani nimefanya nini?Unanivunja mguu (What have I done? You are breaking my leg).” Another voice responds,  “Ambrose, usiwe na shida. Usijali (Don’t you worry, Ambrose).” “We were just seated here around 10pm when the officers came and started beating us. They said they were on patrol and asked us why our shop was still open,” said an attendant at the shop who was arrested. Kisauni OCPD Sangura Musee said investigation had been launched. “I am yet to get more information from the OCS on the matter. Give me time so that I can establish what really transpired,” said Mr Musee. A resident, Shali Mote, accused police of harassment and extortion. “The shop has been operating till late night and we have not received any complaints. This is not the first time police are harassing people and this should stop,” said Mr Mote who has lived in the area for more than 15 years.   Officers arrest attendants.
