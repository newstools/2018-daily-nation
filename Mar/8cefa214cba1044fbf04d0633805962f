The real estate sector, which has been experiencing a boom in Kiambu County, is set to suffer a setback after Governor Ferdinand Waititu announced that his administration has outlawed uprooting of coffee by investors for construction. Mr Waititu said this was aimed at protecting the crop which has in the recent past been under threat from the real estate business which is perceived to have better returns compared for coffee farming. The county boss said, whereas real estate players were welcome in the county, they should invest in areas without coffee. “We do not want to see people uprooting coffee to put up houses. To those (investors) buying coffee farms in Kiambu, they should continue with the coffee business, but not putting up houses. We want to revive the sector, so build in areas without coffee,” said Mr Waititu.
