Team Kenya’s management has changed the departure dates of some of athletes who will compete in athletics so as to maximise on the benefits of training at high altitude ahead of the Commonwealth Games set for Gold Coast, Australia. The first batch of athletics team comprising race walkers, and men’s 100 metres and 400m runners left the country Friday night, with the next batch leaving Saturday and Sunday. The men and women’s marathon teams will be the last to leave the country on April 8 for the “Club Games” that start on April 4 to 15 in Gold Coast. Kenya’s are boxing, triathlon, shooting, bowling and table tennis teams have already arrived in Gold Coast for the Games. Olympic and World 3,000m steeplechase champion, Conseslus Kipruto, and World 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri are among the athletes whose departure has been pushed forward from Sunday to April 7. Kipruto his team mates in 3,000m steeplechase - World Junior 3,000m steeplechase champion Amos Kirui and Abraham Kibiwott - will leave at the same time alongside Obiri and her 5,000m counterparts Eva Cherono and African Games 5,000m champion Margaret Chelimo. The 10,000m trio of Jonathan Muia, Josphat Bett and World Junior 10,000m champion Rodgers Kwemoi will also leave on April 7. Muia won gold in 3,000m steeplechase at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games where Bett claimed silver in 10,000m. Athletics programme gets underway on April 8 to 15 at Carrara Stadium, but the men’s 3,000m steeplechase and 10,000m finals are due April 13 while women’s 5,000m final will be on April 14. Rugby teams, Kenya Sevens and Kenya Lionesses are due to leave the country on Sunday for Hong Kong Sevens due April 6 to 8. While the women’s team will fly to Gold Coast on April 7, the men’s team will check in April 9 for their competitions that start April 13-15 at Robina Stadium. “I am glad that our requests have been granted and this should spur good performance from the athletes, who want to maximise on the high altitude training in Nairobi,” Team Kenya’s head coach Japheth Kemei said yesterday, adding that most of those exempted from traveling will have stayed in Gold Coast for two weeks which would not be helpful. Kemei said the team’s training has gone well since the athletes checked into camp on March 4, adding that athletes are determined to better the previous performances that saw them top athletics table in 2010 edition of the games in Delhi and in 2014 in Glasgow. “With only three defending champions in our midst, this team that is full of newcomers is ready to explore the world and post good performances in Gold Coast,” said Kemei. The 2015 World javelin champion Julius Yego won the javelin title in 2014 Glasgow while Jonathan Muia and Purity Kirui who won men and women’s 3,0000m steeplechase. Muia has since shifted gears and will compete in 10,000m. Kemei said the country should expect surprises in sprints what with the 2015 World 400m hurdles Jonathan Bett having regarded form on time. Bett has three fastest times this season in the world with his best of 48.88 coming from Pretoria on March 8 after 48.95 at the same place on February 10.
