The conflict sparked by Orange Democratic Movement to unseat Ford-Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula as Senate minority leader has deepened, with Raila Odinga's Nasa co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka digging in. Mr Mudavadi, the leader of Amani National Congress, and Mr Musyoka, the Wiper Party leader, on Friday declared their support for Mr Wetang’ula. ORENGO In a dispatch sent to newsrooms, Mr Mudavadi's party said the co-principals, including Mr Wetang’ula, held a consultative meeting in Nairobi following the happenings in the Senate Thursday. "The principals have reaffirmed their total confidence in Hon Wetang’ula as the official leader of the minority in Senate. Their support for Wetang’ula in this regard is unwavering," the statement read. The Orange Democratic Movement wrote to Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka on Thursday seeking the removal of Mr Wetang’ula as Senate's number three. The orange party wants Mr Wetang’ula replaced by Siaya Senator James Orengo. Even though Speaker Lusaka ruled the meeting that resolved to have Mr Wetang’ula removed was valid, his removal would be suspended as the election of his replacement was unprocedural. At the same time, a defiant Mr Wetang’ula Thursday declared that he is going nowhere, warning ODM to prepare for a “messy divorce”. “If you want a divorce, then you must be ready because it will be noisy, messy and it will not be easy," the Bungoma senator warned.   ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna said the affiliate parties are free to leave.
