Anti-Doping Association of Kenya (Adak) has partnered with the Kenyan Premier League to conduct sensitization activities to a number of football teams across the country. Adak Corporate Communication Officer Simon Mwangi said the partnership is part of their awareness creation campaign for all sports disciplines contrary to the false notion that anti-doping was only meant for athletes. Speaking in Busia on Monday during the anti-doping verification workshop for coaches from various disciplines and games' teachers across the county, Mwangi said they have also conducted sensitization activities for Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK). He said Adak has so far sanctioned eight athletes to confirm the magnitude of the matter. “Although it is not our mandate to sanction athletes, our primary mandate is to impart knowledge on participants on anti-doping. “We shall continue engaging stakeholders across the country. Our major objective is for everybody to get information that will help the future generation in this country," he said. Participants were told that not only those who test positive to banned substances are culpable, but also those who fail to give samples, those in possession of the banned substances and who fail to be tested. Other offenders are those who traffic banned substances. The offences carry a jail sentence of four years or life ban, but can be reduced to two years if the culprit admits if caught or co-operates with the anti-doping team. Athletes Kenya Busia Branch Secretary Hilda Amusogot said no single case has been reported in the county.
