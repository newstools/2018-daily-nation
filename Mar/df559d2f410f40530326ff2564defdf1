Tragedy struck Kona ya Musa Village in Ukunda, Kwale County on Sunday night when twin children died in a house fire. According to neighbours, the four-year-old children were in the house alone at 8pm when the fire broke out. It took three hours for residents and fire fighters to contain the blaze. Msambweni OCPD Joseph Chebusit said the fire might have been caused by an electric fault. Furious residents demanded Kenya Power to compensate the family. KENYA POWER "We are tired of unstable power and have complained several times to no avail," Mr Abdulhakim Shedi said, adding that Kenya Power should be held responsible for the deaths and loss the family incurred. Mr Hamisi Khatib also blamed Kenya Power for the fire. "The company has been slow in responding to emergencies," he said. The bodies were taken to Msambweni Referral Hospital mortuary.
