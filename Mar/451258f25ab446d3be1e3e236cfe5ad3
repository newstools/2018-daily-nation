Two people have died following a road crash involving a Toyota Probox car at Kenyenya along the Kisii-Kilgoris road. Three others survived with critical injuries and are receiving treatment at Akemo Hospital. The two who died are said to be relatives. Kenyenya Police Boss Isaac Thuranira said the 5pm incident happened after the driver lost control of the vehicle. â€œIt was drizzling and he was negotiating a sharp corner but lost control of the vehicle. It rolled before overturning," he said. Mr Thuranira urged road users to be extra-careful during the current rainy season saying the roads are slippery and the rains may blur vision. "I urge motorists to be cautious keeping in mind the heavy rains," he said.
