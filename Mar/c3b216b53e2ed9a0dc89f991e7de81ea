The National Police Service Commission (NPSC) has embarked on second phase of vetting senior police officers even as it urges officers to further their studies to boost their competencies. NPSC chairman Johnston Kavuludi Monday said that police officers are being encouraged to pursue higher education and scholarships to handle modern day crime. “The modern police officer should offer security commensurate to international standards including combating cybercrime and we urge them to go to school and acquire degrees and diplomas,” said Mr Kavuludi who paid a courtesy call to Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago in Eldoret. He said the commission was liaising with the Commission for University Education (CUE) to identify officers with the right qualifications for them to benefit from promotions and other allowances. POLICE HOUSING He said that the commission was also in the process of improving on police housing which he said has been neglected for long. “The Ministry of Interior is working with that of Housing to improve the welfare of the officers. We urge the officers to remain patient as this issue is receiving the right attention,” said Mr Kavuludi. Mr Kavuludi said the six day vetting process which targets chief inspectors of police, those in the office of officers Commanding Police Divisions and those in county commanders offices will kick off from Tuesday in Uasin Gishu County before moving to Trans Nzoia, Kakamega and Nairobi counties. All other senior commanders’ positions including those from the traffic department have already been vetted. Mr Mandago lauded the commission for carrying out the police vetting in a clear and transparent manner devoid of favouritism.
