Kenya Prisons opened their campaign at the ongoing Women's Africa Club Volleyball Championship with a straight forward 3-0(25-10,25-15,25-15) win over Nigeria's Customs on Wednesday night. Prisons were rarely troubled in this assignment against a Nigerian team, which had also lost their opening engagement versus Cameroon's INJS on Tuesday. Prisons, who are five-time African champions strolled through this game without necessarily having to fight, with the return of experienced libero Elizabeth Wanyama offering the requisite cover at the back court. Also, debutants Lorine Chebet and Sharon Chepchumba, who kept the Customs players on the back foot all through, attracted praise from Prisons coach David Lung'aho. "We played fantastic volleyball," a delighted Lung'aho boasted. "Lorine has an electric speed in attack coupled with a perfect block, whilst Sharon has a thunderbolt attack," Prisons will return to the pitch to face Ivorian side Asec Mimoas on Thursday at 3pm in their second assignment, an hour before Kenya Pipeline take on Uganda's Vision club. Thursday's Fixtures: ASEC Mimosas (CIV) v Kenya Prisons - 3pm, Vision Club Uganda v Kenya Pipeline - 4pm, Douansed (Burundi) v INJIS (Cameroon) - 5pm, Harare City (Zimbabwe) v Bafia (Cameroon) - 6pmAhly (Egypt) v Rwanda Revenue Authority - 8pm
