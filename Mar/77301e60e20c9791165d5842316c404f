Nanyuki police have launched investigations into the killing of a 24-year-old waitress whose body was found in a hotel water tank. Two employees of Sportman’s Arm Hotel, where the waitress identified as Caroline Nduta worked, appeared in court on Tuesday over the killing but did not take plea. Investigating officer David Bett said there was bad blood between Nduta and Ms Margaret Njeri because the two were involved romantically with Mr David Mbugua. Police asked to be allowed to hold Ms Njeri and Mr Mbugua for two weeks to enable them complete investigations. HEADGEAR Mr Kibet told the court that Ms Njeri would undergo a DNA test “because her headgear was found near the body”. “We need time to establish if there is a link between the hair samples found near the tank and her,” Mr Kibet told the court. The court allowed the two to be remanded at at Nanyuki Police Station until March 19 when the case will be heard. Nduta disappeared from her place of work on Thursday, four hours after reporting for duty. Her body was found two days later in an underground reservoir at the hotel. It had a cut on the belly and bruises on the hands and legs.
