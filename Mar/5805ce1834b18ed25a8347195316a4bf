The High Court in Lodwar on Friday nullified the election of Turkana Woman Representative Joyce Emanikor over irregularities. The petition was filed by Pauline Lokuruka (ODM). Ms Emanikor ran on the Jubilee ticket. RULING Judge Daniel Ogola Ogembo said vital Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) forms were not stamped. He also said the results on the IEBC Portal, the declaration form and the gazetted results were did not match. They all had different figures. The judge slapped IEBC with Sh4 million as costs of the petition to be shared by the Ms Lokuruka and Ms Emanikor. The ruling was made in the afternoon and Jubilee supporters who had waited for the ruling since 8am confronted Justice Ogola as he was leaving the court room, forcing him to seek refuge in a nearby room under tight security. APPEAL Jubilee leaders led by Turkana South MP James Lomenen and Ms Emanikor calmed down the supporters. Ms Emanikor said the allegations of using relief food, voter bribery and intimidation to win were baseless. "Donâ€™t be worried because after this ruling, we are moving to the Court of Appeal," she told her supporters outside the courtroom in Lodwar Town.
