The Raila Odinga-led National Super Alliance (Nasa) summit has ordered its senators to hold a retreat and report to them within two weeks on the fate of Mr Moses Wetang’ula as the Senate minority leader. The senators on Tuesday defied Mr Odinga and coalition principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi — who make the Nasa summit, the coalition’s highest organ — and elected Siaya senator James Orengo to the influential position. Mr Odinga, Mr Musyoka, and Mr Wetang’ula held a two-and-a-half-hour meeting on Thursday in which senators are said to have vented their anger against Mr Wetang’ula whom they accuse of being disrespectful. MUDAVADI SKIPS “The senators have expressed themselves frankly in this issue, and Hon Moses Wetang’ula, who has been the leader, has also had an opportunity to respond to the issues,” Mr Odinga said after the meeting held at a Nairobi hotel, and which was skipped by Mr Mudavadi. Mr Odinga said after the meeting, it became clear that there were a number of issues that the senators must deliberate on before a final decision can be made. “We have agreed that senators will go for a retreat within the next 14 days and discuss issues regarding the operation within the Senate, how to deal with issues which have been contentious and report back to the Summit within two weeks,” Mr Odinga said. Mr Odinga refused to discuss the fate of Mr Orengo and Mr Wetang’ula in the two-week period before the retreat. “Two weeks is not a long time. Let us just give the senators two weeks,” Mr Musyoka said.   It comes hot on the heels of ODM meeting that nominated Senator Orengo as Minority Leader.
