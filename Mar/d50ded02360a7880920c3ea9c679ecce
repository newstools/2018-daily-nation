Police are offering Sh1 million bounty on a suspect accused of leading an organised criminal gang that is behind the spate of robberies and killing in Mt Elgon region. The suspect, Timothy Kiptanui Kitai who is popularly known as Cheparkach is said to be armed and dangerous. 'TROUBLED REGION' Dozens of people have been killed in the region in the recent past which was on Tuesday declared by the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i as a troubled region. Early this week, the government imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the region in a bid to curb resurgent violence. While speaking at a public meeting in Kipsigon, Bungoma County, Dr Matiang’i issued  a warning to the gangs he said were led by Cheparkach. “You can run, but we will get you. We have your identities and it is only a matter of time before we arrest you,” he said. Many residents continue to flee from the area to seek refuge in other counties due to attacks carried out mainly at night. About a decade ago, the region was a battle ground for an amorphous group calling itself Sabaot Land Defence Forces which was demanding for land rights and accused the government of allocating settlement schemes to non-natives. The gang was quelled by military officers and their commander Wycliffe Matakwei killed. Residents said some of the SLDF members who were recently released from prison after serving jail terms of 10 years could be avenging by targeting those they think set them up. Most people who spoke on condition of anonymity believe the former prisoners were picking out specific families. Residents say the gang members are well-trained and have recruited members in every ward in Mt Elgon constituency. They said that after launching raids, the gang members cross over to Uganda.   Interior CS orders police to hunt down killers in the region.
