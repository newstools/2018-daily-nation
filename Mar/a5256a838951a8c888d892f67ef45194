There were conflicting reports among Nasa senators Monday on when Siaya Senator James Orengo will be endorsed to replace his Bungoma colleague Moses Wetang’ula as the Senate minority leader. Mr Orengo was expected to be endorsed at the Nasa Senate Parliamentary Group meeting Monday after members expressed lack of confidence in Mr Wetang’ula’s leadership. Although a section of the group members, led by Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina, said Mr Wetang’ula’s fate had already been decided, his Homa Bay colleague Moses Kajwang’ said a meeting on the issue will be held Tuesday. “I can tell you that Mr Wetang’ula’s case is a done deal. We met today and endorsed Mr Orengo’s name,” Mr Kina said yesterday at Parliament Buildings. OUT OF TOWN However, Mr Kajwang’ said the meeting had been pushed to Tuesday morning at Parliament Buildings after members said they were out of town Monday. “Tuesday will be a great day,” said Mr Kajwang’. “We want everything to be done in broad day light.” A notice sent to members read: “A meeting of the Nasa Senate Parliamentary Group is to be held on Tuesday, March 20, 2018 at the Senate lounge, Parliament Buildings at 9am.” According to the notice, on the agenda is the election of a Senate minority leader. RESOLUTION On Thursday last week, the ODM Parliamentary Group meeting at Orange house passed a resolution to kick out Mr Wetang’ula over claims of mistreating his colleagues in the House. The Speaker was informed of the move but delayed granting ODM its wishes. Mr Lusaka ruled that even though the party’s meeting that resolved to have the senator replaced was valid, his removal would be suspended as the election of Mr Orengo as his replacement was not procedural. The Speaker’s ruling is the reason the meeting is necessary to ratify ODM’s decision. Although a section of Wiper and ANC senators have said they may not attend the meeting because of the positions taken by their party leaders, ODM still has the numbers to carry the day.
