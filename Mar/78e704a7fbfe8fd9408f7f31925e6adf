A secondary school student on Tuesday evening defiled a 10-year-old girl in Tarbaj Sub-County while she was herding her parents’ donkeys. The student, who studies at Tarbaj Secondary School is reported to have committed the act at around 6pm. The incident was reported at Tarbaj Police Station after which the victim was taken to Tarbaj Sub-County Hospital for examination and treatment. Tarbaj Deputy County Commissioner Andrew Mwiti confirmed the incident saying the case was under police investigation. This is the second incident of rape in a span of one week in the county with the first incident involving a 15-year-old girl who was gang-raped by three people for three days in Habaswein Sub-County. The girl, who is currently receiving treatment at a Nairobi hospital, is reported to have suffered serious injuries during the ordeal. This latest incident comes a day after interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i toured the county and warned chiefs against the use of maslaha system in resolving rape cases. In recent months, cases of defilement have been on the rise in the county.   Dr Matiang’i said the communal dispute resolution “maslaha” should never be applied in rape cases.
