For the umpteenth time, public university lecturers are on strike, once again over a pay dispute with the government. This is the fourth such strike in the past one year and the cumulative effect is paralysis of academic programmes with a consequent negative impact on students, parents and the economy. It has become an annual ritual whose long-term impact is to dilute the quality of university education, deny employers of credible human resources and degrade academic staff. Indeed, the persistent standoffs cast Kenyan universities in a negative light at the international level, meaning our students and lecturers may not be able to compete effectively out there. DIALOGUEThe government, universities administration and lecturers must sit down together and fix the problem once and for all and give the students a degree of certainty in their academic progress. The proposal by Labour Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani to bring the managers of public universities and the Universities Academic Staff Union to the negotiating table to end the strike is most welcome. Such talks should be done in an environment free of threats and coercion. There should be genuine concern to end the suffering of the thousands of students who have been forced to spend more years in university than is necessary. Hardline positions and threats by the parties will only worsen the situation and prolong the suffering of the students. We ask the parties to move with speed to resolve the stalemate.
