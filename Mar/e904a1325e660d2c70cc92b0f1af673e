More than 2,000 teachers have applied for the 900 advertised jobs in Wajir County. Data collected from the region by Friday shows that more than half of them had applied for vacancies in primary schools. JOBS The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) announced the recruitment of 900 tutors to work in Wajir County following the transfer of non-local teachers from the county over insecurity. Chief executive officer Nancy Macharia said 585 teachers will be posted to primary schools and 315 to secondary schools. Ms Macharia said those eligible should be Kenyan citizens, aged 45 years and below, must have original professional and academic certificates, and must be registered teachers. TRAINED However, Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) Secretary-General Wilson Sossion asked TSC to call off the process and recruit untrained teachers. Mr Sossion said the norm of teacher deployment was that they should be trained and deployed to their community. He said Northeastern has become a natural employment bureau. “The region should allow their own children to train as teachers. If there are no candidates, the Ministry of Education should reduce college entry grade,” said Mr Sossion. TRANSFERS He said it was unfair to have children out of school yet teachers could be hired from the region. Many schools in Northeastern were closed for lack of teachers, following their transfers over insecurity. Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Secretary-General Akello Misori supported the move to transfer teachers who felt unsafe in the area. “We agreed with TSC that they be moved and taken to safer areas,” he said.   Many teachers left the county following a Shabaab attack.
