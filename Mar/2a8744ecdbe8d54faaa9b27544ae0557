The Standard Chartered Bank’s “Road to Anfield 2018” football tournament which was initially scheduled for today has now been pushed back to March 17. The bank on Wednesday said the move was to accommodate the visit by Liverpool’s legendary goalkeeper Bruce David Grobbelaar who will arrive in Kenya next week to attend the five-a-side tournament. The annual tournament gives Standard Chartered Bank clients and media teams a chance to fight for a ticket to Anfield, the home of Liverpool FC. Nation Media Group FC is among the teams that will compete in the tournament. “Liverpool FC Legend, Bruce David Grobbelaar, will be in Kenya next week to attend the finals of the Road to Anfield five -aside football tournament,” Standard Chartered Bank’s corporate affairs manager David Lawrence said in a statement. “Grobbelaar is a former Zimbabwe international footballer who played as a goalkeeper, most prominently for Liverpool FC between 1981 and 1994. “The original eccentric genius between the sticks, Bruce will be best remembered for the wobbly-legged penalty heroics which brought Liverpool the 1984 European Cup and inspired Jerzy Dudek to the same feat in Istanbul 21 years later. “Bruce played 626 matches for the Reds in a glittering 14-year career in which he established himself as one of the Reds’ greatest ever custodians and also returned six First Division titles, three FA cups and three League cups,” the statement added. It further stated: “His brand of showmanship, athleticism and unshakeable confidence ensured he kept hold of his first team place.”
