The transition from manual to digital transactions in the ministry of Lands starts on Monday when it closes registries in Nairobi for 10 days to allow the last phase of the process. The registries that will be closed till April 3 include the Nairobi and Central registries, including Banking Hall and Records Registry. “Upon resumption of services on April 3, 2018, there will be no more manual processing of documents,” Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri said in a statement. The ministry, Dr Muraguri said, has completed the re-engineering of the way the ministry carries out its processes, through the new online system dubbed Lands Information Management System. “To achieve a fully digitised environment, the ministry requires to ensure that all records are scanned and that data is clean in preparation for online services,” Dr Muraguri said, saying the process will then be cascaded to other registries outside Nairobi. Lands Cabinet Secretary Farida Karoney last week said that the new venture will be over in Kenya’s 61 registries by 2020.
