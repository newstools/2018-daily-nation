The chairman of the National Police Service Commission (NPSC) Johnston Kavuludi has denied claims that officers’ salaries have been reduced. Mr Kavuludi maintained that the commission had ordered an audit of what the police officers are required to receive as salaries. “Nobody has had pay cut but we are carrying a human resource and payroll audit to determine who has what it takes to receive a certain salary,” Mr Kavuludi said yesterday in Kitale Town. He added that the commission had not received any resignation letter from officers over salary cut. “Normally, anyone desiring to resign will write a letter to the employer and I have confirmed with the chief executive of NPSC and the Inspector-General that no letter has been received,” he explained. COMPLAINT However, he revealed that the commission received a complaint from the office of the IG that some officers had not presented there diploma and degree certificates yet they were already earning salaries of constables. “These are the ones we said if they have been entered into the system illegally, we would stop the payment until an audit is carried out, which is what we have started doing,” he added. It emerged Monday that graduate and disabled officers have started resigning after the police service commission reduced their salaries by as much as half. Officers, who have already received their March salaries — paid through the Kenya Police Sacco — told the Nation that their take-home pay had significantly been reduced, in some cases by up to Sh26,000. The adjustments, which have mainly affected graduate police officers and those disabled in the line of duty, were effected this month despite a court order directing the government not to implement the reviews by the NPSC. Workers umbrella body, Cotu, condemned the move.
