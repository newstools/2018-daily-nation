The Ministry of Agriculture and Ireland have launched a programme to improve potato farming. The launch on Wednesday was officiated by Ireland Minister for Public Works Kelvin Moran and attended by top Agriculture ministry officials from both countries and the Ireland ambassador. The programme seeks to address the entire chain from soil testing, soil management, quality seeds, best husbandry, to marketing. “The reason the programme is being launched here is because Nyandarua produces the biggest percentage of potatoes in Kenya currently at 33 per cent,” the host Governor, Francis Kimemia, said. YOUTHMr Kimemia said value addition will include starch and animal feed production, as the county eyes the international market for its potatoes. In Nyandarua, Mr Kimemia said, production was below capacity at 40 per cent due to outdated farming practices among other challenges. Mr Moran said the partnership will include making farming attractive to the youth through embracing modern farming technologies, as well as addressing post-harvest losses. “Ireland government is going to offer expert services in the potato value chain among other initiatives focused towards addressing food security by using the potato. "At the end of the day, we want to put more money into the pockets of farmers, and help them to access the knowledge,” he said. Agriculture Principal Secretary Richard Lesiyampe said the programme will be extended to Nakuru and Narok counties.
