Kenya Ports Authority men and women basketball teams have been warned against alcohol, drugs and substance abuse for their negative impact in players’ careers. The players, who together with the technical officials and managers got a rear treat when KPA  management handed them a three-day retreat at the Amani Beach Resort in Mombasa, South Coast to celebrate their league victory, have also been advised to keep off gender-based violence which has broken many families. KPA welfare senior administration officer, Violet Mugambi, who together with Editter Mugambi  delivered keynote speeches, cited cases of people in sports  who have gone into drugs, saying the dangers associated with drugs have far-reaching negative effects, especially to upcoming players. “We as KPA would want you to live drug-free lives. Those already taking alcohol should control  their level of alcohol consumption per day, which should be limited to one bottle for women and two bottles for men,” Mugambi said. The retreat, which concluded Sunday morning and brought together players, technical officials and top KPA managers, also saw the players taking part in team building activities. The management further promised to support the teams under improved terms next season as they prepare to defend their local league titles.
