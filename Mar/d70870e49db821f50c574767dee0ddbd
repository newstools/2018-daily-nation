The National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) President Paul Tergat has assured Team Kenya for Gold Coast Commonwealth Games that their allowances will be paid by Wednesday next week. All athletes are entitled to Sh1,500 each as local daily allowance and US$ 200 (Sh20,000) while overseas. The first batch of athletes leaves the country on Saturday next week for the “Club” Games due April 4-15 in Gold Coast, Australia. At the same time, Tergat has thanked the athletes for their patience even as they faced several challenges including training venues and kitting. “I want to commend you for your understanding and remaining focused in training in view of performing well at the games,” said Tergat after his team delivered training kits and equipment to the athletics team at Milele Hotel, Nairobi. Tergat said he would have wished for all the Team Kenya members to be housed at Kasarani for residential training but regretted the venue’s closure for renovations. “We might have scattered residential training for the various disciplines across the country but I believe we are together,” said Tergat, adding that his team is determined to be transparent in all the transactions involving the athletes. “We have delivered some kits and more are coming. We want everyone to get the kit so as to enable them train comfortably and feel part of this great sporting nation,” said Tergat adding that he has confidence that the team will perform better than previous years.
