Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti has threatened to sack chief officers who do not perform. The chief officers who were approved by the county assembly after a two-day vetting were compelled to sign both resignation and appointment letters. PERFORMANCE Speaking during the swearing-in of the officers and a member of the County Public Service Board (CPSB), he said the officers would be on two-year contracts that will be renewed based on their performance. The resignation letter, he said, would be handed over to the officers should they fail to perform their duties, the governor said. The agreed terms, he added, would focus on accountability, performance, loyalty and service delivery. SERVICES "We want quality and efficient service for Isiolo residents, my administration wants to prevent challenges that affected the previous county government in terms of service delivery," said the Governor. Isiolo's six County Executive Committee members who assumed office in October last year were given three-year contracts, which will be renewed based on their performance.
