This is not a particularly good time for farmers in the North Rift region, the countryâ€™s bread basket. Having heeded appeals to grow more food to end the shortage occasioned by the recent prolonged drought, they have become a frustrated lot. The National Cereals and Produce Board does not seem to have prepared adequately to take in all their harvest. It has had to turn away farmers with their produce, condemning them to heavy losses. And they now find themselves in double jeopardy, also unable to access a major input during the planting season: Fertiliser. The rains are here, and having prepared their farms early, the depots have run out of fertiliser. This is a mighty slap in the face of the hardworking farmers, considering assurances by the government that adequate stocks would be available as the planting season begins. To rub salt into the wound, there has been talk of importing maize from Uganda and elsewhere. Of course that will enable a few well-connected people to profiteer. So, while the farmers break their backs to feed the nation, there are others just waiting in the wings, hoping for things to go wrong and get onto the gravy train. The Agriculture ministry must ensure that there is enough fertiliser so that the preparations for planting do not go down the drain. It should also enable the NCPB to buy more produce. That will enhance food security.
