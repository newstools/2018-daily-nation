Two people, among them an employee of the Laikipia County Assembly, died Sunday after multiple vehicles collided at Marula on the Naivasha-Nakuru highway. Five others, among them Laikipia majority leader Peter Thomi Waigwa, sustained injuries and were rushed to the Naivasha Sub-County Hospital for treatment. CRASH According to the police, a Nakuru-bound bus trying to overtake caused the accident. “The driver swerved back to his lane to avoid an oncoming vehicle but rammed into the rear of a saloon car ferrying the ward rep,” said Naivasha police boss Titus Mathuku. On impact, he explained, the saloon car was pushed to the right side of the road, colliding with an oncoming vehicle and causing it to hit others. Seven vehicles were involved. TREATMENT The medical superintendent at Naivasha Sub-County Hospital, Dr Angeline Ithondeka, confirmed that five people were receiving treatment at the facility. “We have five patients who were brought to hospital and are being attended to. One of them will be referred to Kenyatta National Hospital for a CT Scan,” said the hospital boss. Dr Ithondeka said some of the patients suffered fractures, while others suffered soft tissue injuries. Two accident victims from a different incident were also being attended to at the same facility. The bodies were later taken to the hospital’s mortuary.
