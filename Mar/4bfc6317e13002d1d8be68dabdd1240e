The tourism sector in Lamu is recording a boom in both domestic and international guests who are flocking the Archipelago for the four-day Easter Holiday. Speaking to the Nation early Friday, Lamu County Executive for Tourism, Trade and Industrialisation Dismas Mwasambu said they had recorded a 20 percent increase in the number of tourist bookings in hotels. TOURISTS Mr Mwasambu said local tourists from Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi, Watamu and Malindi had been flocking the region since the beginning of the week. He said the number of international bookings were minimal and attributed the situation to the security status of the region. Mr Mwasambu thanked the National Government for making Lamu safe again, but insisted on increased patrols during Easter. “We are set for the Easter holiday. Guests, mostly domestic, have arrived while others are on the way. This year’s Easter holiday has shown positive signs in as far as tourism response is concerned,” he said. SECURITY Meanwhile, security has been beefed up across Lamu County as visitors stream in. Lamu County Police Commander Muchangi Kioi said security officers have been deployed on Lamu Island, Shella, Manda and the border areas of Lamu and Somalia. The commander said police patrols have also been enhanced, especially on the Lamu-Garsen route. He also promised a 24-hour security system in all locations and public places. “I am assuring both the locals and tourists of adequate security measures before, during and even after the Easter celebrations. “We have enough police officers who have already been posted all over the county, on our roads and the far places of Kiunga and Ishakani border of Lamu and Somalia to ensure the Easter period progresses smoothly and peacefully. There is no cause for alarm,” said Mr Kioi. He urged locals to be vigilant and report any suspicious individual or activity. The county security boss also appealed to the public to cooperate with security officials to ensure safety and peace.
