Bandari move into second place in the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) standings after edging out struggling Vihiga United 1-0 in a tough match at Mumias Sports Complex on Saturday. Second half substitute David King’atua scored in the 81st minute after capitalising on a defensive lapse. Vihiga dominated the better part of the first half and they could have taken an early lead in the fifth minute but Patrick Okullo’s long range shot hit the cross bar. A counter attack from Bandari saw Collins Agade put through Ndemi Keagan whose close range shot was brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Barnabas Tiema on 14 minutes. Bandari’s Hassan Abdalla managed to put the ball at the back of the net but his effort was ruled out for an offside by referee Samuel Mwaura on 16 minutes before Fred Nkata was cautioned for a foul on Bernard Ombeva. Tiema was forced into another save by Joshua Oyoo’s rasping shot, but the resultant corner was cleared at the stroke of half-time. On resumption, Vihiga coach Edward Manoah substituted Andrew Murunga, Chris Masinza and Vincent Wanda for Dennis Wafula, Godfrey Airo and Silicho Soita respectively. His opposite number Ken Odhiambo pulled out Abdalla for King’atua. The substitution made great difference for the Dockers as King'atua capitalized on a defensive lapse from defender Fernandez Tera to hit the roof of the net. “The boys played well especially in the second half,” an elated Odhiambo said after the match. Under-fire Vihiga tactician Manoah, who is still searching for his fist win in the top flight, said they played well in both halves but were unlucky. “Poor finishing cost us the match. I will work on this area,” he said. Bandari, on 14 points, are two adrift of leaders Gor Mahia who have played a game less. Third-placed AFC Leopards could move into second place with a win over Kakamega Homeboyz on Sunday in Machakos.   Muyoti rued the missed chances.
