The Nairobi-Mombasa highway has been closed at Athi River and traffic diverted to Kangundo Road after a bridge was submerged in water following heavy rains. Machakos Base Commander Abdinasir Harun Thursday said that the river broke its banks at Mto wa Mawe bridge, making the busy road impassable. At the same time, houses at the Green Park estate which is along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway was flooded after River Athi broke its banks, with Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua saying that county emergency services had rescued over 50 people.   Dr Mutua further said that with the flood waters still rising, the road was likely to be closed until Friday. “Our emergency assessment is that the highway will be cut off until tomorrow (Friday). The road is now closed,” Dr Mutua said in a Facebook post Thursday. He added that most of those who had been rescued from the flooded Green Park estate were the elderly, house helps and children after houses were submerged in water. Machakos County Director of Rescue Services David Mwongela said River Athi broke its banks following heavy rains in Ngong Hills where it originates. He said the county emergency services had evacuated all residents of Green Park Homes which were partially submerged in water. One person was also rescued from the raging waters, Mr Mwongela told Daily Nation. "We have evacuated all people from Green Park Homes and rescued one person who was trapped in the water," Mr Mwongela said. There were no casualties reported but Mr Mwongela advised motorists to avoid the road.   They tried to cross River Enziu with their lorry but the water carried them away.
