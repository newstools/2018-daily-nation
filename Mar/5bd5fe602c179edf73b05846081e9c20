The government has condemned the 'fake news' circulating on social media about the health of former President Daniel Moi. In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the former President is doing well. “We are forced to clarify that the FAKE news maliciously circulated by some individuals regarding the wellbeing of former President Daniel Arap Moi is completely untrue. “H.E. the former President is in Tel-Aviv, Israel, for a routine medical check-up that has been very successful. H.E. the former President is recuperating well and is in very good health. “He will be sightseeing today and he takes this opportunity to wish all his fellow Kenyans well. We hope that this information will put to rest any unfortunate ill-intended rumours.” President Moi was flown to Israel earlier this week for check-up on his knee. He  travelled together with his son and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi.   Lee Njiru says he is responding well to treatment.
