Avenue Hospital in Kisumu has suspended a nurse suspected of stealing a newborn baby. The nurse is currently being held at Kondele Police Station for questioning. SUSPENDED She was arrested by police on Friday at the facility after colleagues raised the alarm. On Sunday, Avenue Hospital’s group managing director Dr Denis Ogolla said the management had no prior knowledge of the nurse’s actions. In a statement, Dr Ogolla said: “Avenue Hospital, Kisumu, does not condone the behaviour of the nurse and she has been suspended from duty pending the police investigation. “The hospital management acted upon the information as soon as it came to light by securing the baby’s health and safety and then immediately notified the police, resulting in the subsequent police investigation,” said Dr Ogolla. SUSPECT The nurse is said to have taken the child for clinic, claiming to be its mother. But colleagues said she had not been pregnant. Kisumu OCPD Christopher Mutune said they have launched investigations into the matter. “She was arrested [for being in] possession of the kid suspected to have been stolen. “We will only release her after we have verified what transpired. We will not hesitate to charge her if she is found to have stolen the baby,” Mr Mutune said. “We are still not aware whether the baby was stolen or not. The investigation is on.”   She claims she is the mother but colleagues did not see her pregnant.
