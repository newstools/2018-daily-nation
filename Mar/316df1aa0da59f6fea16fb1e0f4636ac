Hi Brenda, My boyfriend left me without any reason! The truth is that I can't do without him so I don't know how to handle this! What should I do? Dear Desperate Diana, When you say you can't do without him, what exactly do you mean? Because you can clearly type just fine without him, which means you can move your fingers, which means you're breathing, at the time this goes to print, anyway. Which part can't you do without? And why did he leave? Other than he can do without you. Stop wasting your time and emotions on people who are thriving in the absence of you in their lives, and move on to someone who feels the same about you – with less co-dependence, preferably, if a relationship is what you seek. Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda? E-mail: lifeanstyle@ke.nationmedia.com   Here's what you can do to be more relaxed around him – don't be around him.
