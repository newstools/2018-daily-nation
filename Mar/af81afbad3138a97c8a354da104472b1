Bandari FC’s free-scoring midfielder Anthony Wambani says hard work will hold the club in good stead this season. Speaking on Wednesday after being named Player of the Month for February by the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya, the 18-year-old prodigy said the award “proves that hard work pays”. “I remember our coach Ken Odhiambo telling us at the beginning of the season that we stand to benefit a lot if we worked hard, and this has now come to pass,” said Wambani, who was traded from Kibera Black Stars. He beat three other players for the monthly award sponsored by LG Electronics. The teenager, who has scored three goals in the Kenyan Premier League so far — a brace against Sofapaka in the league opener in Narok and the lone goal against Wazito in Mombasa — got 18 votes, two more than second placed Chris Oduor of Mathare, while Meddie Kagere of Gor Mahia was third with 13 votes. Apart from the Sh100,000 cash award, Wambani received a 49-inch TV courtesy of LG Electronics. Wambani’s team mates at Bandari were also given Sh50,000 to share. Mombasa County sports executive, Sports Kyalo Munyoki, presented the prices on behalf of the sponsors. He commended SJAK for the initiative which he says will go along way in motivating players. Bandari vice chairman Musa Hassan lauded the team for starting the season on a high and urged them to keep up the tempo.
