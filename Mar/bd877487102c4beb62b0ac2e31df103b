Local leaders in Garissa have asked young people in the county to take up jobs that require technical skills instead of looking for elusive white collar employment so that they can be self-reliant. While speaking in Garissa on Monday, deputy governor Abdi Dagane said negative attitudes amongst the youth hindered them from pursuing technical courses. TECHNICAL SKILLS Mr Dagane said the county government is focusing more on young people acquiring technical skills. He said the county has invested heavily in the Garissa Vocational Training Institute which is free of charge for young people from the county. He was speaking during a enrolment drive of vocational training which is funded by the European Union and implemented by the Aga Khan Foundation in partnership with the Garissa county government. County executive committee member in charge of Education Habiba Nasib said it was unfortunate that technical institutions have very few students despite the county government making the courses free. "We are aiming to be self-reliant, so that all plumbers, electrician and other technical skilled personnel come from our county," she said. Members of the Garissa County Assembly on their part assured the executive of their support to ensure youths gets necessary technical skills saying the devolved units can only employ a handful of youth. Abakaile Ward Rep Mohamed Ali said the county assembly is ready to implement necessary legislation to help the youth in the county. The Aga Khan Foundation which is implementing the program under Improving Social and Economic opportunities is also undertaking same project in Lamu and Mandera.
