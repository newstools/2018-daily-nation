Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL) has started recruiting top managers for its Kisumu plant as preparations for operations get under way. KBL managing director Jane Karuku said that the first barrel of Senator Keg will be released from the Sh15 billion facility on July 17. “We have started the exercise of recruitment of senior managers as we embark on the final lap of the rehabilitation works,” she said during an inspection tour of the site on Tuesday. In line with the company’s employment policies, Mrs Karuku said that they will engage more than 70 per cent of the residents in various positions. “Our contractors are currently using locally sourced materials and workers who comprise over 85 per cent in conducting the ongoing mechanical and civil works at the plant,” she said. The move is expected to make a meaningful contribution in jumpstarting the economy of the region as the firm seeks to create more than 1,000 jobs through its value chain.Securing jobs is one of the direct benefits that residents usually demand.
