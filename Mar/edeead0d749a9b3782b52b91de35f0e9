The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Chief Chief Executive Officer, Olivier Gers has resigned. A statement from IAAF indicated that Gers, who had been the CEO since October last year resigned on Monday. “Whilst I am sorry to be leaving, the pre-existing commercial framework makes it difficult for me to apply my talents and fully leverage the assets of the IAAF in the way I would like,” said Ger. “Given my stance, I have resigned so the IAAF can pursue a different commercial strategy for the sport.” Gers said that they have accomplished a lot in the last 18 months for instance outlining a new strategic plan for growth, bringing a new leadership team in place to achieve this plan and securing broadcast and digital rights to expand audiences for the sport. “We have innovated audiovisual coverage of the sport with the creation of IAAF Productions as evidenced by the recent World Indoor Tour besides changing processes at the Monaco Headquarters to better serve the sport,” explained Gers adding that with the team now in place, he is confident the organisation is in the best possible hands to drive growth. Accepting Gers resignation, IAAF President, Sebastian Coe thanked him for the work he has done particularly around putting a strong team in place at the IAAF. “He helped in developing a strategic plan and securing broadcast and digital rights to expand audiences for Athletics globally,” said Coe adding that coming off the best world championships ever, they established a set of reforms that solidly underpins the governance of the sport and having established a solid foundation for growth. “We will move forward with the innovation that will bring in new fans and new partners.” Coe said Gers will continue in his role for the following three months and the IAAF will be recruiting a new CEO in due course.
