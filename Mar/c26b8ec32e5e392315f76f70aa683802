President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday pledged to continue improving police welfare. The President promised better housing and improved equipment for officers during the passing out parade of 3,969 constables at Kenya Police College in Kiganjo, Nyeri County. He, however, kept off the recent controversial pay cut of graduate officers. EMERGENCIES Top security officials, including Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i and Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet also avoided the issue. “You have better and modern equipment to respond to emergencies and we are building better houses for you,” Mr Kenyatta told the mew officers. He nevertheless put the officers to task on their performance and dealing with civilians. NEW CURRICULUM “Kenyans will be watching you keenly and you will be expected to carry out your duties with utmost diligence and professionalism,” he said. The constables are part of 4,000 recruits who joined the college nine months ago and become the first graduating class under the revised police training curriculum. The syllabus was revised to incorporate training on new forms of crime such as cybercrime and terrorism. KICKED OUT According to Mr Boinnet, the curriculum change has been a success and Kenyans should expect to see changes in policing. Thirty one recruits failed to make the cut as they were kicked out of the college for indiscipline and other reasons. National Police Service Commission chairman Johnston Kavuludi also attended the event.   The politics of the last year seems to reflect a well-established pattern of political competition in Kenya.
