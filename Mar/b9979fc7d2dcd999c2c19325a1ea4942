Two men were early Monday slashed to death and their bodies set on fire on suspicion that they had stolen two chickens from their neighbour in Ugweri, Embu County. Ugweri police boss Peter Muchemi said the chicken owner had heard noises in the chicken house and went out to investigate only to discover that two were missing. He raised alarm attracting villagers who mounted a house to house search. Assistant chief Patrick Irungu said the suspects were found cooking the chickens about 300 metres from where the fowls were said to have been stolen. Villagers frogmarched the two, then slashed them with pangas before setting their bodies ablaze.
