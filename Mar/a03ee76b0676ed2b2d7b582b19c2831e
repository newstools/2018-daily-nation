High Court Judge Louis Onguto has died. Kenya Judges and Magistrates Association secretary-general Derrick Kuto confirmed the death, saying the judge collapsed after a gym session at the Parklands Sports Club and was pronounced dead at MP Shah Hospital. When he was first appointed, he was posted at the Constitutional and Judicial Review Division at the Milimani Law Courts and was later moved to the commercial division, his current posting. Lawyers mourned the judge, remembering him as one who stood up for justice in cases he handled. “We have lost one of our finest young judges,” former Law Society of Kenya president Isaac Okero tweeted. Among the cases he has handled is one which he found that the government had erred in issuing titles without consulting the National Lands Commission. Additional reporting by Sam Kiplagat
