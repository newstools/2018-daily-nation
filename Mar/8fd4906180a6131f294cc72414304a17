A proposal by the Commission for University Education to stop the duplication of courses by the public universities is not only sensible, but will also bring discipline in the institutions of higher learning. Over the past two decades, university education has expanded exponentially with the institutions increasing from less than 10 in the 1990s to the current 70. But while a natural consequence of the inexorable rise in the demand for higher education, this expansion has, sadly, not been subjected to rigorous quality control to safeguard standards and professionalism. This has meant that many universities have been offering courses for which they do not have adequate and quality lecturers and facilities such as libraries, laboratories and even classrooms. Driven by the hunger for more students and, therefore, profit, in most cases, campuses have just been duplicating courses offered by their mother universities but without the requisite human resource and infrastructure. The ultimate culprit of this lack of standardisation has been the quality of education offered and the calibre of the graduates produced. This is why the proposal to introduce strict controls in degree programmes is long overdue. The universities will first have to satisfy the commission that they have what it takes before they are allowed to mount courses.
