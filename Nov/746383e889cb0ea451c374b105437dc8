A candidate at Omware Secondary School in Awendo, Migori County is writing his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations from Migori Prison after he was arrested three weeks ago for allegedly stealing a motorcycle. "The student has a pending case in court for stealing a motorcycle and that is why he cannot be released. The prison has made adequate preparations to ensure he sits all his exams as required," said Mr Ng'eno, the officer in charge of Migori Prison. He added: "So far, the student is already sitting his first papers. Should he be granted bail, we shall release him to go and finish his exams from school." 'TIGHT SECURITY' Meanwhile, the exam kicked off smoothly. Most of the exam containers were opened at 6am amid tight security. Migori County Commissioner Joseph Rotich said police officers have been deployed to all the 280 exam centres. "As security officers, we shall be moving around to ensure all is well. Let those who may want to impersonate candidates be warned. We are alert and we shall arrest them," said Mr Joseph Nthenge, the Migori County Police Commander. The county director of education Mr Luca Kangongo said the county has 17,199 candidates with 9,659 boys and 7,540 girls. 'MISSING CANDIDATE' In Vihiga County, parents a candidate at Emusire Boys who went 'missing' for a week are breathing a sigh of relief after he resurfaced, saying he was ready to sit the national examinations. The father told the Nation he had taken the candidate to school to start the exams but did not divulge details on where the candidate had been. Last week, the father and school principal launched a search to locate the student after he fled the school over allegations he was to be suspended over an alleged theft of a mattresses.   Senior government officials supervise opening of exam containers in several counties.
