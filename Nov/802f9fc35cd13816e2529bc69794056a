A parliamentary committee has directed Public Works Cabinet Secretary (CS) to identify contractors with poor track records and blacklist them from being awarded national or county government contracts. The National Assembly Public Accounts Committee also wants the CS to maintain a data base on the performance of contractors and the same made public to enable government departments make informed decisions when awarding contracts. The watchdog committee chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi in its report of the audited accounts of the national government for the financial year 2014/15, also wants feasibility studies undertaken relating to infrastructure projects. “This is evident in the Judiciary projects of construction of Law Courts in Narok, Eldama Ravine, Mavoko, Kakamega and Lodwar which suffered slow progress due to unforeseen bottlenecks in the work plan execution, resulting to unmet timelines,” the report says. PAC says interest payments arising from delay in honouring payments will be avoided if ministries departments and agencies prioritise the preparation of annual procurement plans.
