The National Treasury has asked Parliament to approve a Sh1.05 billion expenditure to mitigate the consequences of the flooding disaster witnessed earlier in the year. The amount was withdrawn from the Contingency Fund, which is managed by the National Treasury. Every year, the National Assembly allocates about Sh5 billion for response to emergencies such as floods. DISPLACED According to the Kenya Red Cross, scores of Kenyans lost their lives in the flooding, which also displaced more than 50,680 households or 271,000 people. The deluge also wreaked havoc on property and left road networks and other infrastructure in the affected parts of the country in ruins. The approval, if granted, will pave the way for the National Treasury to regularise the disbursement and replenish the fund for future emergencies. DECISION Treasury Cabinet Secretary has also tabled a report in the House, detailing the expenditures. These are expected to be perused by the House Budget and Appropriations Committee, whose decision will enable the MPs to accept or reject the request. And therein lies the catch. With the families and others affected by the floods still hurting, there is a need to establish that the money was used for the intended purpose and the victims were duly compensated to enable them rebuild their lives. VICTIMS Many a time, resources allocated for such undertakings have ended up in the hands and pockets of a few greedy and undeserving individuals instead of the genuine victims. This amounts to a slap in the face for families and individuals affected by such calamities. Kenyans expect the MPs to go through the report with a fine tooth comb to ascertain the veracity of the expenditure.
