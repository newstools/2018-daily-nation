Police are pursuing the housekeeper of former Cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae over the theft of Sh5.1 million from a safe in the family bedroom. Court documents show Lilian Maina is being sought after she allegedly disappeared with Sh2 million, £20,000 (Sh2.6 million) and $5,000 (Sh508,500). The money was stolen from a safe belonging to Mr Nyachae’s wife while she was away in the UK attending to her ailing husband. Police wanted to detain for a week the maid’s daughter, Grace Waitura, “who picked her [up] from the residence and escorted her to Kitengela”, but a court rejected the request. Milimani magistrate Kennedy Cheruyoit set her free unconditionally, questioning whether she had an obligation to lead the police to where her mother was and whether she was an accomplice. “The respondent has information [on] the whereabouts of the suspect and if released it will be difficult to effect arrest and make recovery of the stolen money,” police say in court documents. TRACING THEFT The documents reveal Mr Nyachae’s wife, Grace Wamuyu, found her safe empty on October 8, a day after she returned home after eight days in the UK. Her four employees were taking care of the home while she was away, but on returning she found that one had fled. Mrs Nyachae said that on September 28 she opened her safe box, which was in her bedroom, to get some cash but she forgot to take back the safe keys. On September 30, she travelled to the UK and left the four employees to watch over the home. She returned to Kenya on October 7 with her husband and the following day, October 8, she found the safe empty and the keys in the key hole. “The investigation commenced and Grace Waitura was arrested on October 29 on the strength of Safaricom phone calls data which showed she had picked [up] the suspect and escorted her to Kitengela area," says an affidavit sworn by a Cpl Jacob Mong’are.
