A Nairobi court has adjourned the trial of 35 individuals facing charges in the loss of Sh227 million at the National Youth Service. Chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti pushed the trial to Friday to allow a lawyer representing two clients go through court records and appraise himself with what transpired on Wednesday. Mr Kirathe Wandugi was not in court on Wednesday and he argued that his clients were not represented in his absence. At the same time, the suspects asked the court to bar Nation journalists from covering the proceedings. They said the media house has been biased against them. Mr Ogoti summoned two Nation journalists to appear before him on Friday.
