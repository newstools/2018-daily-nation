Some 15 Kenyan professional golfers flew out of Nairobi on Monday for Lilongwe and Kigali, for both Malawi and Rwanda Open golf championships, set for Thursday until Sunday. According to the list of names released by the professional Golfers of Kenya (PGK) captain John Wangai, 12 of the pros are heading to Lilongwe while four will play in the Rwanda Open. Those who left for Malawi were Greg Snow from Muthaiga, Simon Ngige (Thika), Dismas Indiza (Mumias), Riz Charania (Windsor), Ganeev Giddie (Muthaiga), Sujan Shah (Sigona), Anil Shah (Royal), Erick Ooko (Royal), David Wakhu, Tony Omulli, and Joseph Karanja, all from Golf Park. Those who were due to wage battle in the Rwanda Open are Kopan Timbe, Sullivan Muthugia, Justus Madoya, and Alfred Nandwa. They will be joined by other pros from Uganda, Tanzania, and from the hosting country Rwanda for the $10,000 (about Sh1 million) which is up for grab since reigning champion Dismas Indiza will not be defending his title as he tries his luck in Malawi where the prize money is $50,000 (Sh5,000,000). By Monday, the Malawi Open, sponsored Airtel, Toyota Malawi, TNM, and Umodzi Park among others, had attracted a field of 95 drawn from Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa, Namibia, Swaziland, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and Portugal. “It is the first time Malawi is staging an open professional golf event and they are very excited about it and are looking forward to growing the event, not just to attract African professionals, but others from elsewhere in the world,’’ said Malawi-based Kenyan golfer Kimanzi Muthengi, who has been helping the organising committee in inviting some of the pros mostly from the East Africa region. The Malawi Open tees off with the official practice round today followed by the Pro-Am event on Wednesday where the pros will be joined by local amateurs. The first round for the pros is set for Thursday. Meanwhile, one of the club’s leading golfers John Ngure carded net 69 to beat Patrick Wanjohi on countback to win the Doctors Golf Day sponsored by Dr. Kamundia, Dr. Gatinuand Dr. Matu at Kiambu Golf Club at the weekend.
