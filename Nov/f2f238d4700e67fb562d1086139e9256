GERMANY Paco Alcacer scored the winner as Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund twice came from behind to beat defending champions Bayern Munich 3-2 on Saturday and move seven points clear of their third-placed rivals. Robert Lewandowski twice gave Bayern the lead at Signal Iduna Park against his old club, but Dortmund captain Marco Reus equalised on both occasions before substitute Alacer struck in the 73rd minute.
