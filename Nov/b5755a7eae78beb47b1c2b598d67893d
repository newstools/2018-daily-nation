Anyolo was born on May 18, 1956 in Tongaren, Bungoma and was ordained priest for the Catholic Diocese of Eldoret in 1983. Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Kericho on December 6, 1995 and was consecrated as Bishop of Kericho on February 3, 1996. On February 20, 2002, The Holy Father John Paul II appointed him as Apostolic Administrator of Homabay upon the resignation of Rt. Rev. Linus Okok Okwach.
