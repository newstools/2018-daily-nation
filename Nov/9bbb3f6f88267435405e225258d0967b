A Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) recruit died on Tuesday afternoon in Malindi, Kilifi County, after collapsing during a run. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Nzioka, the KDF officer who oversaw the recruitment, said the man died at Tawfique Hospital where he was taken. FIRST AID First aid was administered after the recruit collapsed at Alaskan grounds. “Our doctors offered first aid and rushed him to Tawfique as his condition worsened,” Lt.Col. Nzioka said. "Unfortunately, the young man passed away upon arriving at the hospital.” Regarding the turnout for the exercise, Lt.Col. Nzioka reported that it was the largest and placed the number at 400. He said, however, that there were no slots for women in Malindi this year. Those who reported to the venue were turned away. Lt.Col. Nzioka cited challenges in areas including physical fitness, weight and height. “Residents who did not get a chance today should try again in future,” he said.
