Western Stima coach Paul Ogai is banking on his new signings to deliver silverware to the Kisumu-based side during the 2018/2019 Sportpesa Premier League. Ogai  guided the Powermen back to the top league after they were relegated to National Super League (NSL) in 2017. He believes that the team is back stronger and better prepared to challenge big boys for league and cup honours. Stima have welcomed back  Kennedy Otieno from Posta Rangers, Baron Oketch who had decamped to Ushuru and Vincent Omumbo who had joined Tusker FC. Other signings include Vincent Odongo from Nairobi Stima, Henry Onyango (Kibera Black Stars), Martin Oduor from (St Joseph FC) and Samuel Olare from Sony Sugar. Ogai has also signed Ian Otieno from Gor Mahia Youth, defender Luke Ochieng from Posta Rangers, Edwin Omondi (Chemelil) and goalkeeper Antony Obonyo (Kenya Police). "I know our fans are expecting a lot from us this season but I’m not worried. We have worked hard in the preseason and the new boys have settled in well. We have good players in every department and I’m sure it will be a good season for us,” Ogai spoke to Nation Sport. At the same time, the club has released eight players ahead of the new season. Forwards John Oruko and Dennis Ochieng have been termed as surplus. Following them through the exit door are Maurice Duckly (midfielder), Geoffrey Were (goalkeeper),Geoffrey Ochieng(defender), James Omino (defender), Remmy Makumbi (defender) and John Oginga (defender). The team is set to play another SPL side Sony Sugar in a preseason friendly at Moi Stadium, Kisumu on Wednesday morning.
