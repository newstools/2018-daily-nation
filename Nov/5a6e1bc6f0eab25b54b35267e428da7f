It is now down to mathematics for Kenya, United States and Singapore as they battle for second place in the 2018 World Cricket League Group III in Oman. The six-nation Championship is being used as a qualifier for the World Cricket League Group II next year. Two teams will be promoted. On Saturday, Kenya fought to beat Singapore by 12 runs for their second consecutive victory to keep their hopes of qualifying alive. Oman were the first team to seal their place in Group II next year after they claimed their fourth consecutive win on Friday, crushing United States by four wickets. The victory saw Oman top the group by eight points drawn from four matches while United States, who have three wins and one loss, have six points. Singapore and Kenya, who have two wins and two losses each, have four points each. However, the Asians have a better aggregate and thus lie in third place. Kenya are fourth followed by Uganda and Denmark on two and zero points respectively. Kenya must now beat Denmark on Sunday by a good score, and hope that Singapore defeat United States on Monday by a low run-rate or number of wickets. Kenya lost to Oman by five wickets and USA by 158 runs to complicated their run. Victory for Kenya and Singapore will see them tie with United States on six points each with the run-rate left to settle who joins Oman in Group II next year. Victory for USA will see them have eight points to tie with Oman, who still have a match at hand against Uganda on Sunday. Against Singapore, Kenya, who won the toss elected to battle to score 324/9 (50 overs) but their opponents managed 312 all out.
