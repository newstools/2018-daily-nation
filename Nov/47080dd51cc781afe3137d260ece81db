Two college students who worked at a Kayole clinic allegedly owned by fake doctor Mugo wa Wairimu have been arraigned at the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi. The two, Ms Risper Auma Ogony and Mr Victor Gathiru Kamunya, were on Thursday charged with seven counts, among them operating a clinic without a licence. Mr Kamunya is a student at Kenya Medical Training College in Siaya County while Ms Ogony is pursuing a diploma in procurement at Kiriri Women's University of Science and Technology in Nairobi. The court ordered the duo remanded until November 15 as the court awaits a pre-bail report. Their alleged employer, Mr Wairimu, is still on the run days after an NTV expose.
