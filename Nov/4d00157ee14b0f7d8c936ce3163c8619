Police have dismissed as false, a report by an employee of Deputy Chief Justice (DCJ) Philomena Mwilu, that he was abducted by people who demanded to know her residence. A statement from Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss George Kinoti identified the employee at Ms Mwilu's residence as Cosmas Mutua Daudi. ALLEGATIONS The statement said that Mr Mutua was not forcefully captured and held by people who demanded to know Ms Mwilu's residence, as he claimed in a report filed at Kilimani Police Station on November 8, 2017. The man narrated that the incident took place the day before after he went to Nakumatt Junction along Ngong' Road to shop. He told police that he boarded a matatu at Junction Mall stage and alighted at Impala stage. Mr Mutua claimed that it was while he walked along Makindu Road that he was stopped by three people on a motorcycle, who asked him to show them where the DCJ lived, but that he declined. "He alleged that he was forced to board their motorcycle and was taken towards Adams Arcade before they joined Elgeyo Marakwet Road," police said. Mr Mutua claimed, in the report filed under OB NO. 44/08/11/2017, that since he remained adamant, the three people abandoned him at Muringa Road. Police, however, carried out investigations and established that he gave false information. "There was no such incident. He was arrested and booked under OB. NO 74/2/11/2018 and will be arraigned on November 5," the statement said. SHOOTING On October 24 last year, an unknown gunman shot and injured the DCJ's driver in Nairobi. The driver, identified as Police Constable Titus Musyoka, was shot outside Marsabit Plaza along Ngong' Road. Police treated the incident as a robbery but investigated it to establish the facts. They later recovered two guns believed to have been stolen from Mr Musyoka.   Justice Mwilu was not in the car at the time of incident.
