Five Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam candidates at Maragua Muslim Girls Secondary School in Murang’a have been arrested after they were found with four phones in the examination room. Confirming the incident on Monday, Murang’a County Commissioner John Elungata said invigilators and supervisors will also be interrogated on the circumstances under which the phones found their way into the examination centre, adding they must have been culpable. He said police have intensified the search for 22 other phones which are believed to be in the school. Speaking to journalists at the school, the county commissioner said they are also investigating whether the incident has been happening since the KCSE exam started.   PLOT "Examinations are closely monitored and the security agents notified us after noting something fishy happening inside the examination room. There seems to be a plot between the students and the invigilators but the investigations will guide us on that," he said. He revealed that the invigilators will be replaced. Among other items recovered at the school were the phones’ charger boxes and a receipt. According to a source, the students would take photos of the examination papers and send them to some other people who would then send back the answers. The police officer guarding the exam centre detected unusual activity and notified the security bosses. The suspects have been detained at Maragua Police Station for interrogations.
