Kenya continued to impress at the Amputee Football World Cup in San Juan de Los Lagos in Mexico storming to the knock-out stages for the first time. Kenya were due to play defending champions Russia Thursday night in a round of 16 clash. The winner will face either Ireland and Turkey in the quarter-finals. Dubbed Amputee Stars, the Kenya national team finished second in Group “F” on six points from a 2-1 win against United States of America and maximum points from Liberia who withdrew from the tourney citing financial hiccups. Turkey, who beat Kenya 4-1 in the opening match, topped the group on nine points with a whooping 12 goals. Kenya Amputee Football Federation (Kenaff) secretary general Peter Oloo said their aim was to improve from the last edition of the World Cup in 2014 where they finished 17th out of 24 participating countries. Oloo thanked Nairobi County Governor Mike Mbuvi who helped the team travel to Mexico. The team donned kit branded “Team Sonko” s in their second group game against USA. The Nairobi Governor has promised them Sh2 million if they clinch the World Cup and Sh1 million if they finish runners up.
