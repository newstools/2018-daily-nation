Bandari leave the country on Friday morning for Tanga to play another pre-season warm-up friendly match against Tanzania Premier League side Coastal Union FC at Mkwakwani Stadium. Bandari team manager Wilson Oburu confirmed that they will be leaving for Tanga on Friday morning and play their hosts in the afternoon. “We will return home immediately after the match,” said Oburu. The coastal team continued their winning form in their pre-season warm-up friendlies when they won all their three matches in Kilifi counties between Tuesday and Thursday. They started their tour beating Malindi Combined 5-0 at Alaskan ground on Tuesday. The Malindi side then requested Bandari for a re-match, which took place at the same venue the following day and the Mombasa team won again 4-0. The SportPesa Premier League side ended their Kilifi county tour by edging Kilifi Combined 2-1 at Pwani University grounds on Thursday. During their 5-0 thrashing of Malindi Combined, Bandari got their goals through Yema Mwana and veteran Shaaban Kenga, who scored a brace each and the other netted by Brian Otieno, who registered his first goal since signing for the team from Nzoia Sugar. In the rematch, Bandari maintained their supremacy by whipping Malindi Combined 4-0 with goals scored by Joshua Oyoo (brace), Siraj Mohamed and Abdalla Hamisi. They completed their Kilifi tour winning 2-1 against Kilifi Combined in a match watched by a good crowd at Pwani University grounds. Brian Otieno scored his second goal for his new team with the other goal coming from David King’atua. Oburu said all the players are in good shape and hope they will remain so for their opening SportPesa Premier league match against Gor Mahia at Mbaraki Sports Club on Saturday next week.
