Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka is the latest politician to pay a courtesy visit to retired president Daniel Moi at his Kabarak home in Nakuru County. Mr Musyoka on Friday led a team of Ukambani leaders among them his son, Mr Kennedy who is an MP in the East African Legislative Assembly, and Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr to Mr Moi's home where they were welcomed by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. The two leaders are said to have discussed Mr Musyoka's new role as the chairman of the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission for South Sudan. In a press statement issued by Mr Moi's press secretary Lee Njiru, Mr Moi said it was important for young leaders to forge unity among Kenyans even during the most difficult of times.   “Young leaders should strive to be united in their service to the public,” said Mr Moi. The former president said young leaders now are in a better position to improve service to their constituents. “When I became the Rift Valley MP in 1955, I was the MP for the entire Rift Valley and I used to cover the entire area in a Land Rover,” recalled Mr Moi. The former president has been hosting Kenya's top leaders in his home recently with President Uhuru Kenyatta, former rival Raila Odinga and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho among those who have paid him a courtesy call. But Deputy President William Ruto's attempt to pay his former mentor a courtesy visit failed over a scheduling hitch.   President Kenyatta holds a brief meeting with former President Moi and his son, Gideon.
