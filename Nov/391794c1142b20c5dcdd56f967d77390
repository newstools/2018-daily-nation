The stage is set for the 14th edition of the World Aids Day marathon that will be held in Kisumu on Saturday. Unlike in previous events where the starting and finish point of the marathon has been at the Jomo Kenyatta Sports ground, this year's run will begin at Pandpieri Primary School in Nyalenda and end at Joel Omino primary school. But the route will remain the same, around Milimani Estate with athletes taking part in the 42km race making four rounds, before crossing the tape. Last year's winners were Bernard Tangus and Hellen Chepkut, who timed 2:20:42 and 3:14:56 respectively. The two have not confirmed coming back to defend their titles. Besides the main marathon, other events line up include half marathon (21km), 8km for junior men and 6km for junior women. Children and people aged 45 years and above will also participate in a 2km race that will be held at Joel Omino Primary School. Athletics Kenya Nyanza North Chairman Joseph Ochieng said that they expect more than 500 participants since the run is a charity event. He said that stringent measures have been put in place to curb cheating, which has been common in the competition. "Cheating should not be there this time around because we have increased vigilance. Those who attempt will be smoked out and handed over to the police because we have no time for them," warned Ochieng, adding that top ten finishers in every category will walk away with rewards.
