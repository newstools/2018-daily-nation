Kenyans on Thursday hit out at the Confederation of African Football following its decision to bar Harambee Starlets from competing at the Africa Women's Cup of Nations. Following an appeal by Equatorial Guinea, Kenya was struck off the eight-team list of competing sides and replaced by the West Africans with barely a week until the start of the tournament. Equatorial Guinea had earlier been barred from competing in the tournament after they were found guilty of fielding an ineligible player, but upon appeal, the decision was overturned. "Decision comes just 10 days to the start of the tournament. Surely Caf what sort of Dispute Resolution and Sports Governance is this?" El Hadary posted on Twitter. "No matter how I try to rationalise what is going on (with Starlets) it makes no sense at all," Naythan - Din Kariuki added. Journalist Mukami Wambora meanwhile termed the development as "devastating news for Kenya." Football administrator Lordvick Aduda however argued that Football Kenya Federation's appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport could be time-barred. "It takes time to file the documents, serve the parties and for a hearing to start," said Aduda, who was part of the Kenya Football Federation team which successfully sued the government at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.   CAS is the ultimate conflict resolution body in the world of sports.
