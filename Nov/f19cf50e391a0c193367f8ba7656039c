Tottenham Hotspur on Friday confirmed Harambee Stars captain Victor Wanyama has suffered a new injury setback hours after playing the entire match in their 3-1 win over West Ham United in the last 16 of the Carabao Cup. “Victor Wanyama is unavailable this weekend following an injury sustained to his left knee in the game against West Ham on Wednesday,” Spurs tweeted on Friday evening, news that could leave Harambee Stars head coach Sebastien Migne scratching his head ahead of Kenya's crucial 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sierra Leone on November 18 in Nairobi. He joins team-mates Jan Vertonghen (hamstring), Danny Rose (groin), Eric Dier (thigh) and Vincent Janssen (ankle/foot on the list of players who have been ruled out of Spurs' Premier League match against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. Wanyama joined Spurs on a five-year contract from Southampton in July 2016 for a fee believed to be in the region of £11 million (Sh1.4 billion). The defensive midfielder has since gone on to play 77 matches for the north Londoners in all competitions, including 36 in 2016-2017, 18 in 2017-2018 and three this season.
