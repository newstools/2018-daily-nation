JOINT EFFORT Macharia (38) and Kamau (28) were apprehended at Kegochi area by a team of officers from the DCI and the Kenya Wildlife Servcie. Via Twitter, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said the two were found with ivory worth millions of shillings. Johnah Kirui, Nyeri County's Criminal Investigations Officer, said they suspects will be held for interrogation and processing ahead of arraignment on Monday.
