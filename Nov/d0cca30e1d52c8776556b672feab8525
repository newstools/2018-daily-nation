An imam in Malindi, who was found guilty of sexually assaulting his nine-year-old stepson and bought his silence with Sh10, has been sentenced to life in prison. Malindi Senior Principal Magistrate Sylvia Wewa said the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Madrassa teacher sodomised the minor on March 23, 2016. Ms Wewa said the religious leader, 37, had betrayed the trust of stepson who looked upon him for care, love, shelter, food and education. Earlier this month, Ms Wewa gave the prosecution two weeks to conduct a social audit of the accused before he is sentenced. The convict, who has two similar cases in court, was given 14 days to appeal the sentence. Mr Francis Auma, an official at Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri), welcomed the verdict. “Let this be a lesson to all children molesters,” he said in a statement adding, “having worked with the family over the years, Muhuri will continue to seek justice and ensure rule of law is followed to the latter”.
