Two traffic police officers based at Makuyu Police Station who were accused of bribery have been set free on Friday. Anti-Corruption Courtâ€™s Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi set them free citing failure of a key witness to testify in the case. The magistrate said the key witness, Mr Jack Musomba, who found the money never recorded a statement and was never called as a witness. Inspector Seth Barasa and Corporal Mureithi Munyaka were arrested on January 27, 2017 and charged with soliciting Sh36,000 from motorists. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives recovered Sh25,000 from the accused at the time of the arrest. The court has ordered their Sh60,000 cash bail returned.   Anti-graft agency says they received thousands of shillings from drivers in Nairobi and Murang'a
