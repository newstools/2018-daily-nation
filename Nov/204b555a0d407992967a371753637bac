Maseno University students on Sunday evening held a protest over alleged harassment by police. The learners barricaded the busy Maseno-Busia road with boulders and lit bonfires on the road, inconveniencing hundreds of road users for several hours. Maseno University Communications Director Owen MC’Onyang’o told Nation that the students were protesting over the detention of their colleagues who had gone to Maseno Police Station to report about an attack on four of their colleagues by thugs on Saturday night. He said that the students took to the streets after their colleagues were held by the police. They claimed that the law enforcement officers were harassing them. REPORT “They went to make report about some of their colleagues who were attacked by thugs. While at the police station, they disagreed with the officers who then detained them. “The students saw the detention as another attack and started protesting," said Mr MC’Onyang’o. A student told the Nation that the students, who were held by the police but have since been released, are George Sam and Edwin Nyangwera. DETENTION He said the two had bitter exchanges with the officers at the station over the manner in which they were treated when they went to make the report, which led to their detention. “The students two were not treated well by the junior police officers who were at the station, leading to bitter exchanges leading to their detention ,” said the student. Kisumu West OCPD Meshack Kiptum said that they were doing all to restore order on the road.
