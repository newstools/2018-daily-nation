An entire village in Kilifi County was on Friday flattened, leaving about 800 families homeless. Three people were taken to hospital after they fainted when the bulldozers descended on their houses. The Mwendo wa Panya village sits on 24-acre piece of land in Kanamai that stretches to the beach front and it has been at the centre of a dispute between a private developer and squatters on the land. On Friday morning, two bulldozers descended on the structures, including churches and schools, leaving a lot of destruction the locals say runs in hundreds of millions. Victor Mwaganda, a ward representative, said the locals had a stay order from court which the developers ignored.   “I showed the man in charge of the demolitions the court order in the morning but he said it was fake went on with the demolitions,” Mr Mwaganda said. He added: “This is a clear disobedience of the court and it has resulted in unnecessary loses.”   Mr Mwaganda said the residents were not given enough time to move and that the court eviction order was communicated to them on Thursday night. Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and Senator Stewart Madzayo arrived in the village at 2pm and ordered the demolitions be stopped.   Mr Kingi and Mr Madzayo assured the locals that they will rebuild their houses and also initiate court proceedings against the investor for not honouring a court stay order.
