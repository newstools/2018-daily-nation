There is still hope for Tottenham and Liverpool in the Champions League - but the picture is a little complicated. Basically, it could all be about away goals. Here's exactly how both teams can go through.TottenhamFinal round of fixtures - Tuesday, 11 December: Barcelona v Tottenham (20:00 GMT), Inter Milan v PSV (20:00)After beating Inter Milan 1-0 at Wembley on Wednesday, Mauricio Pochettino's side moved up to second in the Group B table.They are ahead of Inter because they have a better head-to-head record in their two matches - they lead the Italians on away goals.Spurs lost 2-1 to Inter in the San Siro in their first meeting in September. So that's 2-2 on aggregate as it were.This all means that if they finish level on points with Inter they will be the ones who go through.So, Spurs will qualify if their result at Barcelona matches or betters Inter's result at home to PSV. LiverpoolFinal round of fixtures - Tuesday, 11 December: Liverpool v Napoli (20:00), Red Star Belgrade v PSG (20:00)Liverpool's situation is slightly more complex.

Both teams will have nine points to PSG's eight, and who finishes top will depend on the result at Anfield.There are two ways Liverpool can finish above Napoli - with a 1-0 win or with a victory by two goals or more.A 1-0 win would edge them through on goals scored. That's the simple scenario. This next one is a little more complicated still.If PSG draw at Red Star and Liverpool win, the Reds, PSG and Napoli will be level on nine points.They would be separated by their record in matches against each other - essentially a mini three-team group, discounting results against Red Star.A Liverpool victory on 11 December would see them top that on six points, with PSG and Napoli level on five points.Who progresses out of those two would depend on Napoli's result at Anfield.
