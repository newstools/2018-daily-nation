With a Sh5 billion grant from the European Union, the dream of a permanent solution to Nairobi’s chaotic public transport system is within sight. This is a timely injection of funds to revive a project launched in 2015. The Sh9.6 billion Nairobi Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) entails buying high-capacity buses and developing the requisite infrastructure. Nairobi cannot stake a claim to being a modern city when its transport system is in a shambles with its roads clogged with traffic most of the time. The amount of time and money wasted in traffic daily is colossal. The World Bank estimates that Nairobi’s traffic jams cost Sh50 million in lost productivity daily. For a city that once had a reliable and efficient public transport system, the degeneration into the current mess began with the influx of matatus on most routes. ORDERLY TRANSPORT With the death of Kenya Bus Service (KBS), city commuters bid goodbye to orderly transport. Kenya is always the trendsetter in the East African region but, on the BRT, Tanzania has edged ahead with Dar es Salaam enjoying the sanity that comes with orderly city mass transport. This project is expected to take about three years to fully develop. The grant is the best cushion for the Nairobi County leadership and the Transport ministry to ensure that a proper foundation is laid for this major infrastructure project. PRIVATE CARS It is now up to the county and national governments to raise the balance of Sh4.6 billion for the full implementation of the project, which will significantly change the face of the city. But, most importantly, to ease commute for city residents, a neat, reliable and affordable public transport is the best motivation to get private cars off the roads and eliminate the chocking congestion.
