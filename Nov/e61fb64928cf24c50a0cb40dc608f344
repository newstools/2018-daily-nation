Tanzanian songbird Saida Karoli will feature in two musical shows in Nairobi and Kisumu next month. The show, dubbed "African Music Extravaganza," has been organised by Melamani Promotions Ltd, and will feature musicians from Kenya, Tanzania and DR Congo. COMEBACK Ms Karoli sings in her native Haya language which she blends with Kiswahili. This will be her comeback show to the Kenyan music scene, having kept a low profile for a while. She had previously staged successful concerts in Kenya. Some of her immensely popular songs include "Mapenzi Kizungu", "Maria Salome" and "Kitobero". However, it is Maria Salome that appears to have rejuvenated and put her back in the musical limelight. She got quite a boost when Diamond Platnumz did a cover version of the song, which initially sparked controversy with some fans claiming that she had been shortchanged. However, during a radio interview, Ns Karoli clarified that she had no objection to Diamond, who is popular with youth across the region, covering her song. The singer toured Kenya between 2006 and 2009. She has also staged shows in Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda. NAIROBI SHOW Ms Karoli will arrive in Kenya on December 4. Her first show will be held at the Meladen Club in Nairobiâ€™s Upper Hill on December 7. Also expected for the show is upcoming Congolese star Rice Matadien, who was formerly with Ferre Gola. The Nairobi-based Rhumba Japan band, also from Congo, and Kenyan ohangla star Musa Jakadala will also entertain rumba fans. Also expected to perform is veteran benga musician Dola Kabarry. The Kenyan artistes will then accompany Ms Karoli and Rice on a performance tour of Kisumu on December 14, at the Tom Mboya Labour College.   Diamond Platinumz is still riding high at the top of his game.
