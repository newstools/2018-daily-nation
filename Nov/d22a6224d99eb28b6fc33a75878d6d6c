Police in Migori have launched a manhunt for four suspects who escaped from custody as they were being escorted to prison on November 29. County police commander Joseph Nthenge said that the four were part of a group of six suspects who had been remanded by court and were being escorted by police from the Rongo law courts to the prison in Migori when they staged their escape from a police vehicle near Stella in Uriri Sub County. CAUGHT Two of them were later caught. "The convicts were being driven from Rongo court back to Migori prison after arraignment. At Stella market, they jumped out the police vehicle and escaped into a nearby sugarcane plantation. Police officers managed to arrest two of them while four are still at large," said Mr Nthenge. He appealed to members of the public to help in nabbing the fugitives. "We appeal to members of the public to help identify the escapees. They are a danger to the public and should be reported to any police station once sighted to have them re-arrested," added Mr Nthenge. Elsewhere, police officers shot and killed a man suspected to be one of a gang of robbers who broke into a civil servantâ€™s house in Migori in the morning of November 29. DISTRESS CALL According to Migori OCPD Kingori Macharia, the police were responding to a distress call when they encountered the suspects who were carrying crude weapons. "We had received intelligence reports that a house belonging to a government's officer was being robbed. As the police were heading there, they met a group of people who were carrying crude weapons. They attempted to attack the police. That is when officers opened fire and fatally shot one of them while the others escaped. We recovered several items that had been stolen," said Mr Macharia. He said that the body of the deceased, which is yet to be identified, was taken to Migori county referral hospital mortuary as investigations continue.
