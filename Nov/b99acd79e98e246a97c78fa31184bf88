Many sighed with relief when Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa formed Cricket Kenya Interim Committee (CKIC) upon the resignation of top officials from Cricket Kenya (CK) in March. CK had been thrown into disarray by the resignation of the chairperson Jackie Janmohamed and director of development Abhijit Raja Sarkar. Vice-chairman Harpar and treasurer Ravi remained in office but Ravi later resigned in August. Janmohammed resigned following the national teamâ€™s poor performance at ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament in Namibia, which saw Kenya drop to Division Three. NEW ERA The changes in the board were supposed to herald a new era in the game. But that was not to be. Since then, cricket leadership has been characterised by an intense power struggle. The wrangles affected the national team that left for Oman on Tuesday to compete in the ICC World Cricket League Division Three scheduled for next week. Besides the controversial selection of players, the team left without head coach Maurice Odumbe. Two sets of players had been picked for the Oman assignment. In the meantime, CKIC secretary David Obuya has declared a Special General Meeting, called by some CK officials on Sunday at Ruaraka Sports Club in Nairobi, illegal. ORDER It is time the minister brought order to CKIC, or let CK conduct proper elections. Eight months are enough time for CKIC to have laid the ground for a fresh elections. All has not been well with the national team, whose performance has continued to plummet since 2004. It is disgraceful for a country that reached the World Cup semi-finals in 2003 to drop to World Division Three due to wrangles among officials.
