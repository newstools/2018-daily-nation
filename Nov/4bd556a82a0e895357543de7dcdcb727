Police have identified a house at Mbezi Beach as where tycoon Mohammed Dewji was held following his kidnapping by unknown people. Dar es Salaam Special Zone Police Commander, Mr Lazaro Mambosasa, told journalists about the one-storey house during a briefing in the city on Monday. SA BUSINESSMEN Mr Mambosasa said that after the businessman was freed, police continued with investigations and found out that he was kept in the house that is a few kilometres from Old Bagamoyo Road. “The house belonged to the late Mwansasu. Its ownership was changed after his death. It is currently owned by his daughter,” said Mr Mambosasa. He did not disclose the name of the woman but added that the house was rented by South African businessmen. Commander Mambosasa said police were also holding taxi driver and broker Twalibu Mussa, who is believed to have close ties with the abductors. He said the lease agreement for the house stated that $1500 (over Sh3.4 million) was to be paid per month. The owner, however, was given only $1300 (Sh2.9 million) and Mr Mussa was paid the remaining $200 as his commission. “Although the house looks posh, it seems it was abandoned for a long time. Our investigations show that during his captivity, Mr Dewji was kept in the ground floor bedroom with his hands and feet tied with ropes,” he added. Mr Mussa, a taxi driver stationed at Whitesands Hotel, said he was the one who introduced the businessmen to the agents, who enabled them to lease the house. He explained that the day after the car linked to the case was abandoned at Gymkhana grounds, he drove the abductors to Ubungo Bus Terminal. The commander said police are holding 40 people so far over the kidnapping. Mr Dewji was kidnapped on October 11 and released about 10 days later.   Three suspects arrested after billionaire Mohammed Dewji abducted Thursday morning.
