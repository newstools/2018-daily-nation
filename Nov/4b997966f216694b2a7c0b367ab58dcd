Harambee Stars duo of defender David “Cheche” Ochieng’ and midfielder Eric “Mapake” Johanna have been relegated from the Swedish top flight after their side IF Brommapojkarna lost 2-1 to AFC Eskilstuna in the second leg of the relegation/promotion playoff on Sunday going down on away goals following a 2-2 aggregate score. Brommapojkarna won 1-0 away in the first leg on Thursday but Eskilstuna, who were relegated from the top tier last season, scored two away goals in the return leg to book a spot in the Swedish topflight, the Allsvenskan, next year. While Johanna was an unused substitute in the match having featured in the second half of the first leg, compatriot Ochieng missed out on the match day squad altogether. The sad news come a day after Harambee Stars forward Michael Olunga’s Kashiwa Reysol was relegated from the Japanese top flight. Brommapojkarna, who were promoted to the top tier last season, join Dalkurd and Trelleborg who were automatically relegated for finishing in the last two places on the 16-team table. Johanna, 24, scored two goals in 25 appearances for the side he joined at the start of the season from third tier side Vasalund while Ochieng', signed from USA side New York Cosmos, featured in 13 of the 30 games. It’s highly unlikely that the former Mathare United sensation, Johanna, will stay at the club with top Swedish clubs showing interest. Johanna has played a key role in Kenya’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifying campaign with a goal and three assists to his name from the four qualifiers. He was the man of the match as Kenya brushed aside Ethiopia 3-0 at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani in October netting a goal and providing two assists in that game. It’s his weighted cross that resulted to Ghana defender Nicholas Opoku’s own goal in the vital 1-0 win over four-time Africa champions Ghana in September.   Kashiwa joins bottom-placed V-Varen Nagasaki as the two teams relegated from the 18-team league.
