An Administration Police officer was on Wednesday arrested after he was found in a Kilgoris lodging with a Form Four student. The two were flushed out from a room in Josvin Bar by officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at around 8pm on Tuesday. Trans Mara West Deputy County Commissioner Mohamed Noor Hassan said the AP officer will be arraigned after investigations are complete. The girl, who is a KCSE candidate, is doing her exams under tight security in one of the schools in Narok County after she was moved from her previous exam centre where the AP officer was manning. The officer is among thousands of security personnel deployed to secure schools as candidates sit for the national exams. Mr Noor said the duo spent the night in police cells but the girl was released to go continue with her exams. “The girl who is below 18 years and will also have to undergo a medical test to ascertain whether she was defiled,” said Mr Noor. According to Mr Alex Tampushi, who witnessed the arrest, detectives had tried to downplay the incident but angry residents pressured them to take action. “We forced them to re-arrest the officer after they released him under unclear circumstances,” said Mr Tampushi. He said the detectives took away packets of condoms from the lodging as exhibit.   Governor wants an end to the disaster following reports of about 14,000 cases.
