Kenyan boxing is staring at suspension from the global game straight in the face. This after the International Boxing Association (AIBA) wrote to its affiliate, Boxing Kenya, this week warning it of serious consequences should government interference in the sport continue. Boxing Kenya is torn down the middle ahead of its eagerly-awaited elections. The confusion has seen two factions each claiming to be bona fide office holders, even going as far as organising parallel leagues. What’s more worrying is that such power struggles come on the eve of the start of qualification for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Rather than find a solution to the impasse, the Ministry of Sport, sadly, seems to have taken sides. This regardless of the fact that AIBA have made it clear that they only recognise the current Kenya office that recently appointed Lt Col Paul Mung’ori as acting secretary general. Kenya’s performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, showed the dearth of the sport. All our boxers were pounded off the ring with just one bronze medal to show in Gold Coast. Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa needs to immediately resolve the crisis. Failure to act would mean that our boxers could miss out on the early Olympic Games qualification fights. It’s sad, for instance, that Kenya failed to send fighters to the AIBA Women’s World Championships going on in New Delhi.
