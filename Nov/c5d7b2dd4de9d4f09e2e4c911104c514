Homa Bay County Assembly Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo is getting into more trouble after her office was sprayed with what police say is livestock pesticide and her furniture broken. When the Speaker arrived in her office on Thursday morning, it was filled with a pungent smell. The new plastic chairs and a table which she bought on Tuesday after the ones she had were taken away were also broken by unknown people. Those who got into the office had difficulties breathing with some shedding tears and others coughing due to the effects of the chemical. LIVESTOCK PESTICIDE Police officers and detectives who went to the office for forensic analysis said the chemical was Triatix, which is used for controlling pests in livestock. The chemical is poisonous and can kill within minutes if consumed. Following the incident, Ms Ayoo accused security guards within the assembly of laxity. “The assembly premises is surrounded by guards and police officers. I do not know why they don’t report destruction cases within the House,” she said. The Speaker sat in her secretary’s office as she talked on her cell phone most of the time. Corridors leading to her office were manned by hawked-eyed private security guards. 'ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT' Kwabwai Ward MCA Richard Ogindo and his Kanyamwa Kosewe counterpart Nicholas Owaka, who accompanied the Speaker, claimed that the spraying of chemicals in the Speakre’s office was an assassination attempt. Mr Ogindo blamed a section of assembly staff whom he accused of leading the attacks on the Speaker. Mr Owaka said they risk losing their seats if the fight at the assembly is not resolved soon. “Our opponents will use this as a strategy to campaign against us. They will say we failed to do what took us to the assembly,” he said. The two MCAs admitted that the county leaders have lost direction. “We still have time to change. We have only spent about one year in office after election. We just need cooperation amongst ourselves,” said Mr Owaka.
