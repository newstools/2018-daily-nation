A suspected poacher was on Thursday charged before a Nakuru court with possession of 208 kilograms of zebra meat. Mr Samuel Gitome Gichura, who appeared before Chief Magistrate Josephat Kalo, was found with the bush meat valued Sh83,200 at Soysambu ranch in Mbaruk, Gilgil without a permit from the Kenya Wildlife Service. According to the prosecution, the meat was packed in eight gunny bags and was set to be ferried to unknown destination by a motorcycle. Mr Gitome was arrested on Wednesday by KWS officers while preparing the meat in the company of two others who escaped arrest. The meat according to the KWS officials, was to be transported to Gilgil and Nakuru towns for sale to unsuspecting customers. Mr Gitome denied the charge. He was released on Sh1million bond with surety of similar amount or an alternative cash bail of Sh500,000. The case will be mentioned on Friday.
