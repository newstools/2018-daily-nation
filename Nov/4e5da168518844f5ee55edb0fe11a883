Samurai International are the 2018 Safari Sevens Champions after beating Kenya Shujaa 21-14 in the Main Cup final at the RFUEA Ground on Sunday. In what was a repeat of the 2015 and 2016 final, Samurai left it late to edge Shujaa in the second half after trailing 14-7 at half-time. The win saw them reclaim the title they last won in 2015. Ruan Mostert, Hugo Stiles and Kurt-Lee landed a try each as Stiles made two conversions to hand Samurai their second Safari Sevens title. Shujaa scored two tries through Daniel Taabu and Johnstone Olindi to lead 14-7 at the break after Taabu converted both. However, Samurai would deny the nervy Shujaa possession in the second half before scoring the decisive try. It's Samurai who lost to Shujaa 38-21 during the 2016 final, just a year after they had beaten the Kenyans 20-19 to win. Shujaa were chasing their ninth title. Kenya Morans settled for third after beating Spain 12-5 in the play-off. Samuel Motari and Mark Kwemoi each got a try as Kwemoi made a conversion. Juan Lucas Martinez scored Spain's try.   Harold Anduvate touched down in sudden death to send Shujaa to the final.
