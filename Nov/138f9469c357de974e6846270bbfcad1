A teacher accused of defiling a student at Moi Girls' High School Kamusinga has been arrested after months on the run. Willy Wanyonyi Musikali fled after allegedly committing the offence in June. DEFILEMENT CHARGE Mr Musikali was arrested in Bungoma County on Tuesday and will be arraigned on Wednesday on charges of defilement. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations confirmed his arrest and preparation for prosecution via Twitter on Wednesday. The teacher’s photograph was published on the agency’s social media account. Mr Musikali is said to have defiled a 14-year-old form two student after summoning her to his office. After the incident came to light, the victim told journalists that the teacher made sexual advances towards her when she arrived. “He told me he had missed me but I told him that the only relationship I would have with him was that of a teacher and a student,” the girl is reported to have said. She claimed the man did not listen to her and that he forced himself on her. Mr Musikali, however, went into hiding, prompting a search by officers led by divisional police commander Gladys Rutere.
