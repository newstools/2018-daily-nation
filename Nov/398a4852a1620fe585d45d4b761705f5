Ulinzi Warriors got off to a bright start in their men's Kenya Basketball Federation Premier League playoffs quarter final after registering a convincing 56-34 victory over Umoja in Game One at Nyayo National Stadium Gymnasium. The soldiers, who were eliminated at the semi-final stage last year, had their forward John Washika nailing eight quick points while celebrated point guard Eric Mutoro and Tiberius Menya hit two three-pointers at an early stage of the game. The trio's crucial points reduced Umoja's Allan Ouma and Mike Juma three-pointers to mere consolations. Ulinzi raced to a 22-11 lead at end of first quarter and proved their dominance over an Umoja side they had beaten twice in the regular season with a 36-24 score line at the breather. A 15-4 return in the third quarter put the game beyond Umoja who suffered a setback when veteran referee June Oluoch disqualified their top forward Gilbert Obiero for use of abusive language. Obiero will now miss their crucial Game Two next weekend. The fourth quarter was awfully low scoring but Ulinzi Warriors coach William Balozi was elated at taking an early advantage. "The team played under instructions to win comfortably and we are headed for a 2-0 sweep to qualify for the semi-final. I had to rest my top five in the last quarter with the job done," revealed Balozi. Veteran point guard Eric Mutoro scored game high 18 points, John Washika sunk 11 for Ulinzi Warriors while Mike Juma and Nicholas Ogol replied with 10 and 11 respectively for the losers. Last year's losing finalists, Blades made a good start in their bid to win their first Men's Premier League title when they defeated Kenya College of Accountancy-University 54-34. Blades, who were beaten 3-1 by Kenya Ports Authority in the 2017 play-off final, showed their class from the onset leading in all the four quarters. Blades led 22-15 at the breather. Samuel Mogoko shot 13 points for Blades while Lawrence Wandera managed to hit 10 for KCA-U. In the women's Premier League playoff quarter-final opener, Storms clipped Eagle Wings 59-40 after leading 26-16 at half-time. Beryl Nkatha got the show started with two quick three-pointers before Mercy Wanyama, who has been sensational all season, compounded Eagle Wings' woes. Storms bossed the third quarter 20-11 before the experienced trio of Eunice Ouma, Everline Kedogo and Rebecca Sarange helped Eagle Wings to lock the scores 13-13 at the end of fourth quarter. However the damage was already done as Storms emerged winners. Wanyama scored 16 points and Nkatha 15 for the winners while Rebecca Sarange replied with 10 for the losers. In the men's Division One play-off quarter final, Barclays Bank beat Eldonets 61-53 after trailing 29-31 at half-time. Six man Lady Bucks shocked full house hosts Queens 38-37 in a closely contested women's Division One Game One.
