Skipper Victor Wanyama is in contention to feature for Harambee Stars in the next week or so after resuming full training. On Thursday, Tottenham Hotspur announced the Kenyan international had resumed training after missing the last two weeks of competitive action. "Eric Dier (thigh) and Victor Wanyama (knee) have both returned to training with the squad," Spurs said on Twitter. It is not clear if Wanyama, who has missed his club's last three matches against PSV Eindhoven, Wolves and Manchester City, will be available for this weekend's tie against Crystal Palace. This is a major boost for Harambee Stars head coach Sebastien Migne who had called up the 27-year-old for Kenya's 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match against Sierra Leone in Nairobi on November 17. Wanyama has endured an injury prone campaign over the past two years owing to some discomfort in his left knee which he aggravated during pre-season in the USA in July this year.
