IN MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE Kenya Ports Authority women's basketball team coach Anthony Ojukwu believes his team is ready to lock out hosts Ferroviario de Maputo at the quarter finals stage of this year's Fiba Africa Champions Cup, when the two teams meet Friday here at the Maxaquene indoor courts. According to Ojukwu, KPA will start as clear favourites if the teams' display in the preliminary round matches is anything to go by. "We have been playing extremely well despite the narrow loses we suffered against First Bank, who beat us 95-74 and I.N.S.S from Congo who won 71-61, and this makes me believe that we're still the favourites against Ferroviario today," Ojukwu said of this epic duel, whose tip off time is 4.45 pm Kenyan time. The tactician noted that the Mozambicans are very fast and mostly play transition offence, which he is ready to counter and ensure KPA reach their first ever semi final. "We have a lot of respect for Ferroviario, coupled with the fact that they will be playing in front of their fans, but that is exactly the situation we want because there is nothing as satisfying as silencing the home crowd," a bullish Ojukwu said. He noted that his players are in high spirits ahead of the match. The dockers will once again rely on speedy guard Jamila Zama, who currently leads the scorers chart with 95 points, followed by Italee Lucas of Inter Club of Angola with 78points. Also expected to star for KPA are Brigid Nanzala, Cynthia Irankunda, Annrose Mandela ,Taudencia Katumbi and Becky Nkatha, who have been having a good championship.
