Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i Friday disbanded the Firearms Licensing Board, just 10 months after he appointed a new chairman and secretary. The CS had in February revoked the appointment of Major-General (retired) Enock Sasia and Major-General (retired) Charles Mwanzia to the position of chairman and secretary respectively. Dr Matiang’i said the decision was reached after consultation with the National Security Advisory Committee on Friday. He said the licensing of firearms had been marred with corruption and incompetence. “We shall put up a new board soon and we shall have a digital register for all firearm holders,” said the CS. HAND BACK GUNS Dr Matiang'i says those missing from the new list must hand back their firearms. He directed that Independent Policing Oversight Authority conducts speedy investigations into cases of extrajudicial killings that have been tabled before them. Dr Matiang’i said his ministry is considering putting up a database that will ensure that all cases are easily tracked. He assured those that had complained about extra-judicial killings that soon "silly games" like a file has disappeared or a police officer has been transferred will end. However, he warned against blanket condemnation of police officers, saying they also suffer pain and cry as they are human. The CS said no one was talking about civilians attacking officers or criminals who were killing them. He was speaking just a day after a group of women sued the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and the Attorney General Paul Kihara over extra-judicial killings.
