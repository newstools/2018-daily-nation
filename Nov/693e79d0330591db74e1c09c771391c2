Elsewhere, Kenya Ports Authority men and women teams qualified for the semi-finals of 2018 Kenya Basketball Federation leagues after seeing off Kenyatta University Oryx (women) and USIU men respectively. KU Oryx, who had lost to KPA 60-33 in Game One in Nairobi a fortnight ago, failed to show up in Mombasa for Game Two, forcing the referees to give KPA walkover while KPA men, who had beaten USIU 64-55 in Nairobi, completed the job in a 62-53 drubbing of their opponents in the return leg in Mombasa.   The Kenyan teams face tough opponents in Africa’s premier club tourney.
