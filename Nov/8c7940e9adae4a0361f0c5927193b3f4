A 66-year-old Dutch man accused of defiling minors will have to spend more days in police custody. Nairobi Magistrate Caroline Nzimbe yesterday directed that Mr Hans Egon Dieter Vriens remain remanded until a pre-bail report is presented in court as well as statements from victims are recorded. “I have heard requests from the prosecution and the defence and I direct that the accused remain in custody until November 16,” said Ms Nzimbe. Mr Vriens was arrested and arraigned in court over allegations of defiling minors aged eight and 10 years old at Nairobi’s Roysambu estate in 2011 and 2014 respectively while pretending that he is helping children from poor families to get education. He denied the charges. The prosecution told the court that he was hiding in the closet of a vacant house in order to evade arrest. “He is believed to be in communication with witnesses and is likely to interfere with them if given bail,” said the prosecution.
