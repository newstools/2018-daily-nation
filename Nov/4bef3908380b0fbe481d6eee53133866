Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has now pledged to help with the medical treatment and rehabilitation of celebrated boxer Conjestina “Hands of Stones” Achieng. Sonko has also promised to secure employment for Conjestina after she gets well. The boxer has been in and out of hospital since falling sick back in 2011. Sonko’s team was Friday expected at Conjestina’s home in Siaya to pick up the boxer, whose state had worsened. A video of the boxer looking unwell went viral on social media on Thursday. Many well-wishers have come up with promises before to help the boxer but nothing came of those pledges. The most recent high-profile case involved Nairobi County, with then Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Alex ole Magelo saying that the county would set aside money to help rehabilitate the boxer. Nothing ever happened. “Our case is different and Sonko’s promises never fail,” said Nairobi County deputy director of communications Richard Bosire. “Sonko is committed to have the boxer fully recovered first.” Speaking by phone from Siaya, Conjestina’s mother Gertrude Adala said she was waiting for Sonko’s team to arrive at her home.
