There are few places that make my mouth water, and even fewer places that could make me forget about watching my weight. But just the thought of the Lennz Pizza Joint’s juicy burger and crunchy fries seasoned with salt could make me do that…and more. Located on Kenyatta Avenue in Nakuru’s Central Business District, Lennz Pizza Joint is welcoming and homely.   Not only is their food tasty and satisfying, but the restaurant is spacious, and has good ambience, décor, theme, and lighting. It is also not noisy, which is a big plus. The restaurant also offered convenient deliveries before, and a month ago it signed up with Jumia Food for more efficient delivery. I fear I might just add a few more kilos. Last year, I tasted their shawarma and I could not have enough of it. I kept going back for more, almost on a daily basis. And boy did I add weight! Recently, I was browsing through social media when I noticed Lennz Pizza Joint had posted a new addition on its menu—burgers. And I couldn’t wait to try it.   When I walked in, the waiters received me with a smile as they showed me where I could sit. On the menu were six types of burgers and I settled for the crunchy chicken burger served with coleslaw and crunchy fries – I have no regrets. The burger was made of a sesame-crusted brioche bun, breadcrumb-coated chicken breast patties, tempura butter, caramelised onion rings, tomatoes, lettuce, and topped with aioli sauce. It was also well-seasoned.   And the best part is I didn’t have to break the bank for the meal. It cost me Sh350 for the burger. And, of course, I also ordered a delightfully tasty chocolate milkshake for Sh250 to wash it all down. I’ll probably have to work out later. But still, I can’t wait to try out the other burgers on the menu. And I hope they taste just as good as their names sound.   I wish they would do more with the side salad, though.
