The construction of the Sh6.5 billion Kwa Jomvu-Makupa Causeway is 40 per cent complete, the government has said. Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia ordered the contractor to ensure the project is completed on time. “The causeway is crucial as it will ease traffic flow to Mombasa port, Moi International Airport as well as the flow of goods from inland counties,” Mr Macharia said. Speaking on during the groundbreaking for the refurbishment of Moi International Airport, he said the government is committed to providing seamless travel experience across all modes of transport. He cited the new Changamwe Roundabout-Airport Road, saying it has eased traffic. “Travel time to and from Mombasa International Airport and Standard Gauge Railway terminus from the central business district has reduced considerably," he said. The causeway is part of the larger Mombasa-Mariakani highway, whose construction was officially launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta last year. The ongoing construction work has disrupted traffic flow at Kibarani. The road is being expanded to a six-lane highway and is set to boost tourism, ease movement of people and goods, and improve efficiency at the port of Mombasa.   Project is funded by the African Development Bank and the Kenyan Government.
