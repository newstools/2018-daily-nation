Defending champions Kenya Shujaa and Kenya Morans launched their Safari Sevens title campaigns strongly, winning their opening matches at the RFUEA ground on Saturday. Shujaa crushed local side Mwamba 53-0 in their opening Pool “A” match as Morans stunned two-time African champions Uganda Cranes 19-12 in their Pool “C” outing. However, the other local side Homeboyz, who are the National Sevens Series champions, put up a brave show before losing 19-14 to Portugal in the other Pool “C” duel. Leonard Mugaisi and debutant Daniel Taabu touched down a brace of tries each as Herman Humwa, Harold Anduvate and Mark Wandetto scored a try apiece for Shujaa. Jonathan Olindi made four conversions while skipper Eden Agero curled over once. Timothy Mmasi and skipper Samuel Motari crossed the white chalk as Mark Kwemoi converted once to give Morans a 12-0 lead at the drinks. Then Motari would complete his brace as Kwemoi converted to stretch their lead to 19-0. Aaron Ofoyrwoth and Kevin Kermundu led Cranes' revival with a try each but all was in vain. “Morans committed a few mistakes in defence to concede two easy tries but winning is the most important thing,” said Kenya Sevens head coach Paul “Pau” Murunga. “I will make some varying combinations in the starting line-up.” Murunga said Shujaa made a perfect start with the huge win adding that he will also try different combinations to see how the players will adapt in subsequent matches. Shujaa meet Apache from United Kingdom in their next match at 2.50pm while Morans are up against Portugal at 2:06pm. The 2015 champions Samurai International and World Rugby Sevens Series core team Spain also had winning starts in Pool “B”. Samurai beat Emerging Uganda Cranes 24-19 while Spain edged out Red Wailers, comprised of local based players and others from the United Kingdom, 27-5.   Apache beat Namibia 28-5 in their opening match.
