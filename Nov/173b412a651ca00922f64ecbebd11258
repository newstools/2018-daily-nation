From Niamey to Songo in Mozambique and at the Kasarani stadium in Nairobi, Kenyan footballers toured the continent in midweek and enjoyed the best possible start to the 2018/2019 season club continental assignments. In Niger, Harambee Stars duo Jesse Were and Anthony Akumu featured as Zambian champions Zesco Unite defeat AS SONIDEP 2-1 in a preliminary round match of the Caf Champions League. Rahib Asmanu and Lazrous Kamboole scored for the winning team. Another Zambian-based Kenyan, David 'Calabar' Owino didn't feature for Zesco in this match owing to fitness concerns, but the central defender has told Nation Sport he hopes to be back in action ahead of the return leg clash at the Levy Mwanawasa stadium in Ndola next Wednesday. At the same time, Harambee Stars vice-captain Musa Mohammed and former AFC Leopards captain Duncan Otieno helped Zambia's other representatives Nkana FC to an identical 2-1 win over Mozambican outfit UD Songo. Harrison Chisala and Festus Mbewe scored for Nkana in the match, while Otieno was sent off for accumulating two yellow cards. Meanwhile, Kariobangi Sharks fielded an all Kenyan line up during their 6-1 thrashing over Djibouti's Arta Solar7 on Tuesday in their Confederation Cup preliminary round first leg tie. Seven Kenyan players also started for Gor Mahia in their narrow 1-0 triumph over Malawi's Nyasa Bullets in a preliminary round match of the Caf Champions League. The experience gained by these players could prove crucial for Kenya coach Sebastian Migne, with the national team all set to compete at next year's Africa Nations Cup in Cameroon.   The Rwandan international walked off the pitch injured after only eight minutes.
