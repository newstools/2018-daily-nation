Newcomers Menengai Oilers, Mean Machine from the University of Nairobi and Nondescripts claimed the scalps of bigwigs as the second round of Kenya Cup rugby league produced major upsets on Saturday. Perhaps the biggest upset was by Nondies, who upheld their fairy-tale run, rallying from behind 14-10 at the break to stun defending champions Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) 27-22 at Ruaraka. Nondies, who had shocked Enterprise Cup champions Homeboyz 20-14 last weekend, ended KCB’s unbeaten run that spanned two seasons. Menengai Oilers - handled by former Kenya Sevens star Gibson Weru - stunned Kenya Harlequins 14-8 at the Nakuru ASK Showgrounds while Machine, who are making a return in the league, upset Strathmore Leos 23-10 in a double-header at Ruaraka. Oilers' victory was a swift recovery from last weekend’s 27-5 defeat by KCB at Ruaraka as Machine also rose from the ashes of a 41-0 drubbing by Kabras Sugar to silence the Leos. As Kabras Sugar upheld their clean run, handing hosts Blak Blad of Kenyatta University 37-10, Homeboyz rose from Nondies' defeat to edge out Mwamba 22-18. Impala also upheld their good run, beating Nakuru 26-22, a week after they weathered a scare from Blak Blad to win 18-15.
