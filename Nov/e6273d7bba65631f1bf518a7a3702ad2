Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia and Football Kenya Federation SportPesa Shield winners Kariobangi Sharks, both of Nairobi, are all set to represent the country in the two continental assignments during the 2018/2019 football season. According to the draw released on Thursday by the Confederation of African Football, league champions Gor Mahia will face Malawi's Nyasa Bullets in the preliminaries of the Caf Africa Champions League. For their part, Kariobangi Sharks will play Arta Solar 7 of Djibouti in the preliminaries of 2018/2019 Caf Confederation Cup. NATIONAL FLAG These assignments will begin on November 27 and our only wish is that both clubs, which will be carrying the national flag, will adequately prepared to give a good account of themselves. Both Gor Mahia and Sharks should, naturally, be motivated by the relatively lucrative financial gains for the winning teams in these continental tournaments, amounting to between Sh28 million and Sh250 million. The fact that Gor Mahia narrowly lost to Tunisia’s Esperance — which went on to win the Champions’ League this year — describes best the sporting potential in this country. TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS The time to get ready for the tournaments is now. We hope both clubs will also make travel arrangements early for this matches, to avoid last-minute headaches, and especially having to extend the begging bowls for funds to pay for the trips. We wish them all the best!
