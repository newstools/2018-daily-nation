Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has appointed and gazetted Charles Mwongera Mikindia as the new chairman of Firearms Licensing Board. At the same time, Dr Matiang’i has appointed six others to be members of the board. The new board members are David Kahinga, Jackson Kimutai Rotich, Vincent Wahoro, Nancy Kabete, Justin Odhiambo Khaduli and Lazarus Mbondo. They will serve on the board for a period of three years with effect from December 3, 2018. “The prior appointments made vide Gazette Notices Nos. 1619 of 2016, 10383 of 2017, and 3147, 7266 and 8536 of 2018 are revoked,” Dr Matiang’i said in the gazette notice. DISBANDED Last Friday, the CS disbanded the board, just 10 months after he appointed a new chairman and secretary. Dr Matiang’i had in February revoked the appointment of Maj-Gen (Rtd) Enock Sasia and Maj-Gen (Rtd) Charles Mwanzia to the position of chairman and secretary respectively. He said the decision was reached after consultations with the National Security Advisory Committee last Friday. He added that the licensing of firearms had been marred with corruption and incompetence. “We shall put up a new board soon and we shall have a digital register for all firearm holders,” Dr Matiang’i said last week.   Matiang’i says decision reached after consultation with National Security Advisory Committee.
