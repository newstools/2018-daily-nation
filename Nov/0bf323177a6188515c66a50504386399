The High Court has quashed a decision by Immigration boss Gordon Kihalang’wa to suspend the passports of seven Nasa leaders and associates in February. The suspensions followed a standoff between the government and the opposition in the wake of Mr Raila Odinga’s mock swearing-in. Despite political temperatures cooling with the March 2018 unity pact between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Odinga, the seven individuals pursued their petition which Justice Wilfrida Okwany ruled on last week. Mr Kihalang’wa suspended passports of Nasa strategists David Ndii and Henry Mien, Siaya Senator James Orengo, Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati, businessman Jimi Wanjigi, University of Nairobi lecturer Adams Oloo and lawyer Paul Mwangi. The suspension came just days after Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i launched a crackdown on politicians and other influential individuals that took part in Mr Odinga’s mock swearing-in as “the people’s president” on January 30. Justice Okwany argued in her ruling that Dr Matiang’i and Mr Kihalang’wa did not give specific reasons for suspending the seven passports and, in Mr Mien’s case, there was no notification at all.   Nasa chief strategist, David Ndii, and businessman Jimi Wanjigi also not spared the purge.
