A Form Four student killed himself Friday shortly after he finished doing his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations at a Mombasa school. The student was found hanging in a classroom at Allidina Visram High School by his colleagues. A source claimed, before the student killed himself, he was facing a disciplinary case after he was found with bhang. The principal of the school Juma Mshimu declined to talk to comment on the incident. Urban police boss Eliud Monari said investigation into the matter is underway. He said the police are putting information together to ascertain the reason why the candidate ended his life.
