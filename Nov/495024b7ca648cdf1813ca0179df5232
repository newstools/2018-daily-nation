KCB FC’s new signing Jamal Mwambeleko is looking forward to getting started at his new home under new boss Frank Ouna. Alongside Ouna, the ex-Simba SC and Singida United player is among thirteen new signings unveiled yesterday by newly promoted side KCB FC. The 24-year old joins the Bankers on the back of a successful two-year stint with Simba. He helped the team win the league in May and finished second at the Cecafa Kagame Cup the following month. "It is true that not many Tanzanians come here to play football, but that means nothing,” he told Nation Sport. “KCB have shown ambition by investing in myself and other quality players and coaches. The Kenyan league is more physical and players run a lot. We are however ready for the challenge and are looking to win something,” he added. Mwambeleko joins KCB alongside compatriot and former teammate Peter Mwanyika who moves in from Singida following his penalty heroics against AFC Leopards in the SportPesa Super Cup in Nakuru in June. KCB FC have continued their bullish activities in the transfer market by roping in Tubane Jemus and Mugabo Gabriel from Rwanda alongside Hemedy Murubose from Burundi. "The squad needs time to gel but we have started well. We have lined up three friendlies during the week against Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards to help us settle and be ready for the KPL opener against Kakamega Homeboyz," added Ouna. Besides the foreign stars, KCB has also raided its rivals to lure Joseph Okoth from Bandari, former Thika United duo of Badi Baraka and Michael Mutinda, Kenya international Bernard Mang'oli (Sofapaka) and Eston Esiye from Kakamega Homeboyz. Other signings include Nichodemus Onyango (Black Stars FC), Clinton Kisiabuki (Nakumatt FC)and Benson Amianda (Ushuru FC). Ouna will be assisted by Elvis Ayany and former AFC Leopards and Sofapaka coach Ezekiel Akwana. Veteran midfielder Micahel Oyando will the team’s trainer as Alex Mwangi picks up goalkeeper trainer duties.
