The national 15s rugby team, Kenya Simbas, ended their 2019 Rugby World Cup Repechage qualifier campaign on a losing note, crushing to Germany 43-6 at Stade Delort, Marseille, France on Friday. Samuel Oliech’s two penalties turned out to be Kenya's consolation as the Germans rolled in seven tries that included Sebastain Ferraira’s hat-trick to win. However, the results counted for nothing as both teams had fallen out of contention for a place at the Rugby World Cup set for Japan next year. Canada, who led the group with 10 points, were due to meet Hong Kong at 11pm for a place in the Japan finals. Canada only need a point from the clash to qualify. However,  Hong Kong had a difficult task of defeating Canada by a margin of 57 points, while hoping that the Canadians doesn’t secure a bonus point for them to make it to Japan.
