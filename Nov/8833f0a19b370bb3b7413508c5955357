KFCB Western region boss Lameck Omingo, who led the operation alongside police officers, revealed that Busia and Bungoma are the most notorious counties when it comes to this offence. The regulator said it will carry on with the crackdown until each operator adheres to the law. “We will not relent until there is some level of sanity in the region for the sake of the young generation,” said Mr Omingo.

The raid followed complaints by residents, who said their children were being subjected to dirty and unrated content.
