A five-judge bench on Monday set a date to begin hearing the case filed by the Director Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji concerning the trial of Deputy Chief Justice (DCJ) Philomena Mwilu. The bench that comprises Justices Helen Omondi, William Musyoka, Mumbi Ngugi, Chacha Mwita and Francis Tuiyot will begin hearings on December 6 this year. They will first rule on two applications by the Federation of Women Lawyers, Kenya and International Commission of Jurists, Kenya who are seeking to be enjoined in the case. Justice Mwilu, whose trial was stopped by the High Court, has challenged the charges brought against her. The DCJ and Mr Stanley Muluvi, an advocate, were to face a total of 13 charges over monies allegedly received from the collapsed Imperial Bank. Mr Haji had asked theÂ Chief Justice (CJ) David Maraga for a bench of five judges to determine whether the DCJ is immune from criminal prosecution. The petition filed by the DPP through Lilian Ogwora, a senior principal prosecution counsel, said the petition raises substantial questions of law that should be determined first. Justice Mwilu stopped the intended prosecution after she rushed to the High Court, arguing that the charges were deliberately and primarily calculated to subject her to public humiliation and embarrassment. Justice Mwilu said that the motive is to remove her from office and the action by DPP is tainted with abuse of power and arbitrary exercise of authority. Further, she said the move is meant to achieve a collateral purpose and not the rule of law or objective of the system of the administration of justice. The DPP, however, said the charges are not malicious or brought in bad faith but they will demonstrate so when given the chance. According to the DPP, the case sought to be stopped is a matter of grave public importance, which concerns the question of conduct of public servants and state officers.   Haji wants the judges to dismiss the stay order.
