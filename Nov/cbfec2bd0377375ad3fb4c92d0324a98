English Premier League legend Robbie Fowler arrived in Nairobi on Thursday for a three-day visit during which he will, among other engagements, conduct a clinic at Jericho's Camp Toyoyo ground in Nairobi on Friday. The legend's visit is courtesy of Barclays Kenya, a member of Absa Group Limited. Fowler, who is best remembered for his time at Liverpool and as the six-highest goal scorer in the history of the Premier League, will also engage premiership fans in Kenya. “As an ex-player of the English Premier League, I am so excited to be visiting the country, I have never been here before, so I am really looking forward to that. I know the passion for the premier league is magnificent and I am looking forward to spending some quality time with all the fans,” Fowler said on his arrival. During his stay, Fowler will host several customer engagement forums, interact with Harambee Stars players and officials and conduct the football clinic with young footballers under the Musa Otieno Foundation, among other engagements. As part of his visit, Fowler will also share his football career experience and business ideas with university students under the Barclays Ready to Work programme. “Our association with the English Premier League is one of our most valuable assets and I assure you that it is one of the benefits we will carry on as we transition into Absa, in the next two years. If anything, you can expect to see more of these opportunities in the future as we continue to bring possibilities to life,” said Jeremy Awori, the Managing Director at Barclays Kenya. Awori said the activities at Camp Toyoyo spoke to the bank’s commitment to continue supporting the growth and development of young people, cognisant of the role they must play in the creation of the Kenya we all want to see.
