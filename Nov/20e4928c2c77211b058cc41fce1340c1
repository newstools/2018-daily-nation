Police in Mandera are investigating a claim by a Knec officer that a disabled student he was to assist write his KCSE exam offered him a bribe to allow someone else write his papers. The Kenya National Examination Council staff, Mr Julius Odhiambo, reported the matter to Takaba Police Station. Mandera West DCIO Eliud Kemboi confirmed the incident. “I am aware of the incident and the police are handling it,” he said on phone. In the police report, Mr Odhiambo said the candidate offered him money at a local guest house yesterday. Knec dispatches officers to assist candidates who cannot write their examinations due to disabilities. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed warned students against engaging in malpractices, such as carrying mobile phones to an examination centre. “Parents whose children will be found with mobile phones in school will be held responsible. Their children will be suspended and blocked from sitting the examinations," she said last month.   One teacher sacked, 45 more to serve suspensions as TSC acts tough on those who facilitated cheating in the 2017 KCSE exams.
