Nurses in Nairobi have said they will down their tools in ten days over promotions and transfers. Ediah Muruli, who is the Kenya National Union of Nurses Nairobi branch secretary said that the nurses will go on strike from December 10 if the county government does not address their concerns. Ms Muruli said lack of promotions, improper transfers and failure to fully implement a return to work formula signed on November 2, 2017 as their key concerns. She said that the lack of promotions has created a situation where nurses retire in job group K instead of job group N denying them decent dues. “Even if they implement the return to work formula but do not promote the nurses of this county or redesignate and put them in their right placements then the strike is inevitable,” said Ms Muruli during a press conference at Uchumi House in Nairobi on Thursday. The secretary explained that the county had written to the union on November 16, 2018 indicating that they will comply with the return to work formula they had signed by December and all eyes are on Governor Mike Sonko to ensure compliance. She said that the county had promised to implement the return to work formula in July this year but they have not done so and has only given the union a letter of goodwill.
