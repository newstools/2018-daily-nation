Ford Kenya has rallied its MPs, both in the National Assembly and the Senate, to support the two-thirds gender Bill. The party Sunday said it will be using its members to ensure the Bill that is already in its second reading in the National Assembly sail through. According to the party leader Moses Wetang’ula, the step seeks to ensure the realisation of the provisions and gains of gender parity. “Ford Kenya joins other Kenyans of goodwill and we have unanimously agreed to support the two-thirds gender rule Bill as it comes for a vote next week,” said Mr Wetang’ula. The Bungoma Senator spoke during a three-day retreat at Seasons Elementaita Country Lodge in Nakuru County. MAIZE PRICES The party leader, who was accompanied by other officials, also asked the government to revise the decision to buy maize from farmers at Sh2,300 per 90kg bag. The decision by the Cabinet to approve the purchase of two million bags of maize at the price has sparked a fierce debate, with various leaders asking farmers not to sell their maize at that price. Mr Wetang’ula termed the price unacceptable. INFLATION “Last year the farmers were paid Sh3,200 per bag and inflation rates have gone high especially imposition of the eight percent tax; it doesn’t make sense to reduce the price of maize,” he said. He noted that the price of farm inputs has gone up and the reduction of the maize price is unreasonable. “Farmers are critical in achieving the Big Four Agenda through food security and job creation. If we want to move ahead as a country, we must protect and defend the farmers,” said Mr Wetang’ula. “We instead recommend that the farmers must be paid a minimum of Sh3,600 per 90 kg bag,” he added. It also emerged that the party will from January conduct its national grassroots elections that will run for two months.   If the proposed law is not passed next week, Parliament could be dissolved.
