The court has on Friday released Migori Governor Okoth Obado on bail after dismissing an application to detain him pending conclusion of a firearms possession investigation. The Kibera court freed Mr Obado on a Sh500,000 bond with surety of similar amount or Sh200, 000 cash bail and ordered him not to interfere with ongoing investigations. The state wanted the governor to be detained for 15 days. Magistrate Joyce Gondani has ruled that prosecution failed to establish why the governor should continue being held in custody. Governor Obado was arrested on Wednesday after police said they found 8 firearms after raiding his Nairobi and Migori homes.   Prosecution wants the governor held 15 days for probe into guns case.
