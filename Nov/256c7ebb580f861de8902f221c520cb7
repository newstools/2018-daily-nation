Four people are nursing arrow injuries sustained during a fight between two Maasai clans at Nkararo, Trans Mara West. Nkararo Chief John Naleke said the clashes broke out due to renewed border tension between the Siria and Uasin Gishu clans. In September, a trench was dug to act as the boundary, “but some people today moved beyond the barrier and started planting crops, raising tension and anger,” Mr Naleke said. Keyian assistant deputy county commissioner Henry Saro said security officers suppressed the fight. “No need for alarm. We sent in officers who restored order,” he said. The victims are admitted at the Narok County Referral Hospital.
