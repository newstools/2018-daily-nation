Kenyan champions Gor Mahia have submitted a list of 26 players to participate in the 2018/19 Caf Champions League due to commence on November 27. The draw for the preliminary round will be done on Saturday in Rabat, Morocco. Conspicuously missing from the squad is Burundian right-back Karim Nizigiyimana, midfielder Kevin “Ade” Omondi, left-back Wesley Onguso and newly signed striker Nicholas Kipkirui who was acquired from Zoo Kericho earlier in the week. Nation Sport understands their is still a tussle between the two clubs over the acquisition of the 22-year-old whose contract with the Kericho-based outfit elapses on December 31. Ivorian Ephrem Guikan, who parted ways with the team early in the week, is not part of the squad. The 23-year-old Ugandan international Erisa Ssekisambu, acquired from Ugandan champions Vipers, has been included in the squad as Guikan's replacement. The 17-time SportPesa Premier League (SPL) champions were eliminated from the champions league 1-0 on aggregate by Tunisian side Esperance, who play Al Ahly of Egypt away in the first leg of the final on Friday. Gor dropped to the second tier interclub competition and managed to reach the group stage, finishing third behind Algerian giants USM Alger and Rayon Sports of Rwanda. The team will be allowed to make additions to the squad in January 2019 should they reach the group stages. The team is Liverpool-bound ahead of their friendly match with Everton scheduled for Tuesday.
