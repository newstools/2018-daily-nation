A Migori man was on Friday sentenced to 30 years in prison by a Rongo court for defiling a 14-year-old girl. Mr James Pesa Olwade, 80, had pleaded guilty to defiling the minor in Awendo in July. Police said Mr Olwade lured the victim to his house and defiled her repeatedly. “He asked the victim to get him some sweet potatoes from his house before he followed her, grabbed her and defiled her repeatedly,” Sergeant Steve Mulumba of Awendo Police Station told the court. RULING Her parents later noticed that she had difficulties in walking and questioned the girl. The girl confided to them and they reported to police. While delivering the ruling, Judge Charles Kamau noted that the accused had committed a crime contrary to section 8 (1) of Sexual Offences Act number 3 of 2006. He regretted the fact that the accused was an elderly man who was trusted by the victim. “I note that the accused is an elderly man several times older than the victim. This age gap aggravates the crime. The fact that as a child, the victim trusted him only for him to violate her is also aggravating,” Mr Kamau said. Mr Kamau said the 30-year sentence will be a lesson to Awendo residents where cases of defilement have been on the rise. “It is unfortunate that the vice is on the rise especially in Awendo and Rongo. Let this serve as a lesson to those who may think of perpetrating the crime,” Mr Kamau said. The convict was given 14 days to appeal.
