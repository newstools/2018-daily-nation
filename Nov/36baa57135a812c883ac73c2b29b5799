A Meru court on Thursday fined a man Sh20 million or life imprisonment after finding him guilty of being in possession of two elephant tusks valued at Sh900,000. Joseph Muriithi was arrested by Kenya Wildlife Service officers on June 16, 2017 at Murinya, Meru. The officers acted after they received a tip off from the members of the public. Mr Muriithi was accused of dealing in wildlife trophies contrary to Section 92 of the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act 2013 and for failing to report the matter to the relevant authorities. He denied the charges but was convicted by Meru Chief Magistrate Hannah Ndung'u. Mr Muriithi was given 14 days to appeal.
