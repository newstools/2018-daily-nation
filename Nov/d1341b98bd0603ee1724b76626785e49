MANCHESTER Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini has made a shock move ahead of his 31st birthday. Fellaini, who joined United from Everton, has opted for an eye-catching haircut as he turns 31 on Thursday. The Belgian, synonymous with his giant hairstyle, posted three pictures of his new trim on Instagram on Wednesday, with the caption "new year, new look #birthday tomorrow". Manchester United team-mate Eric Bailly commented on the post: "noooooooooooo", while Belgian team-mate and Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany joked: "It's photoshopped, it can't be true!!".
