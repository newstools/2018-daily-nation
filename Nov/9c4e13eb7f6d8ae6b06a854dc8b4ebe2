Sandrafelis Chebet and Vincent Kiprotich are the winners of this years' Lotto Foundation Baringo 10km road race. Fresh from winning Isaiah Kiplagat Memorial Cross Country in Ndalat Nandi County, Chebet ran a brilliant race before increasing her pace in the latter stages to win in 33:34.05. Sandrafelis beat her training partner who is also World Under-20 champion in 5,000m Beatrice Chebet who clocked 33:47.16. Antonina Kwambai finished third in 34:00:35. It was delight for Sandrafelis who maintained her winning record in Baringo having won last year's 21km race. "I had prepared well for the race and my target was to win. The race was tight and I had to increase my pace in the last kilometre to win," said Sandrafelis. Beatrice on her part said she was happy to have participated in the senior race and came in second. "I'm happy my training partner won the race because we prepared well with her. I am using the races to prepare for the cross country series as I look forward to be in the World Cross Country Championships team that will be heading to Denmark in March next year," underlined Beatrice. Both athletes train in Londiani, Kericho County and are expected to feature in this seasons' Athletics Kenya (AK) National Cross Country series.   In the men’s 10km race, Vincent Kiprotich from Elgeyo Marakwet defended his title after winning in 28:45.97. Ezra Kipketer came in second after clocking 29:22.95 while Gilbert Kimunyan sealed the podium three in 29:24.97. "The race was tough but I'm happy I defended my title. I want to be in the World Cross Country Championships team and this is part of my build up for the national series," said Kiprotich.
