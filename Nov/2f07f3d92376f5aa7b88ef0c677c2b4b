Some MPs might have been bribed to reject the report on the importation of illegal and contaminated sugar into the country. The claims are contained in a report by the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Committee, which has invited the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Director of Criminal Investigations to investigate the allegations against some lawmakers. The report did not name those who allegedly received bribes. “Based on the oral submissions by the witnesses, it is apparent that some members may have been involved in some form of impropriety,” reads the report. Some of the lawmakers who appeared before the committee are Didmas Barasa (Kimilili), James K’Oyoo (Muhoroni), Jane Kihara (Naivasha), Geoffrey Osotsi (nominated), Simba Arati (Dagoretti North), John Waluke (Sirisia) Wajir Woman Rep Fatuma Gedi, Geoffrey Odanga (Matayos) and Rehab Mukami (Nyeri). Ms Gedi was mentioned by Mr Barasa as the person who was bribing MPs to reject the report.   Moses Kajwang' criticises MPs over alleged bribery in the House to thwart sugar report.
