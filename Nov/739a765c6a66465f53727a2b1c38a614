The ill-fated Ugandan boat which on Saturday sank in Lake Victoria with more than 100 revellers on board was unregistered, unlicensed and probably uninsured, President Yoweri Museveni has said. Mr Museveni said Sunday that the private boat owned by a Mr Templa Bissase and his wife was seemingly overloaded. This is because whereas its capacity is for 50 people, it had about 120 passengers on board. Mr Bissase and his wife are among 31 people whose bodies have so far been retrieved from the water. STATEMENT in a statement he issued Sunday President Museveni said, "Apart from the anti-bad fishing campaign which the UPDF (Uganda People's Defence Force) has been carrying out for some months now on the lakes, the government has also ordered the electronic registration and monitoring of all the boats so that we can know who is where on the lake and why.‚Äù According to police, the main cause of the tragedy was overloading. The police added that the boat was in a poor mechanical shape. "The recovered bodies have been taken to city mortuary in Mulago where they will be picked. However, the search is still on for other bodies. [A] Police chopper has recovered one dead body, total of the dead is now 31," the police tweeted.   Police report that more than 40 people were rescued.
