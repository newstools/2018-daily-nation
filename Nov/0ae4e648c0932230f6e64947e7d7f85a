A National Assembly committee wants Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji to immediately investigate the purchase of two earthmovers at a cost of Sh185 million by the Ministry of Defence. A report by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) tabled in Parliament Wednesday revealed that two machines --Caterpillar brand-- were worth Sh40 million but the ministry paid 185 million, resulting in an excess and illegal payment of Sh145 million. The earthmovers were bought through direct sourcing in the 2011/2012 financial year. The committee also wants the DPP to prosecute members of the Ministerial Tender Committee that approved the procurement. “The ministry proceeded to purchase the equipment despite knowing that it was overpriced from its own market survey,” reads the report tabled by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi. The committee also found that minutes of the ministerial tender committee were missing, and directed the accounting officer to provide them. The committee found that there was no urgency in the purchase of the two heavy duty machines for road construction, civil works and disaster management as records reveal that they have never been used except for training, hence no justification for the huge expenditure.
