Scotland stunned Kenya Sevens 35-14 as the 2018/2019 World Rugby Sevens Series got underway in Dubai in Friday. It was bound to be tough for Paul Murunga’s side in the opening two legs of Dubai and South Africa Sevens, what with several key players missing. It was Murunga’s first assignment of the World Series as Kenya Sevens head coach. Kenya Sevens must now win their next two matches if they hope to make it to the main Cup quarterfinals. They meet France at 11:44am before wrapping up their Pool “B” outing against former Series champions Fiji at 6:06pm. Kenya found the going tough as they trailed 21-0 at the break and were unable to recover as the Europeans capitalised on Shujaa's inexperience to complete the rout. The Scots ran in four tries as well as a penalty try against Kenya’s two tries. Half-back Johnstone Olindi and Dennis Ombachi scored Kenya's tries but it could not prevent the defeat Scotland pulled away 33-7 as Dennis Ombachi went for the touchdown after skipper Eden Agero sliced through the defence. Another debutante Brian Wahinya converted but all was in vain.
