Police in Nyandarua are investigating the brutal murder of a Form Two student whose body was found in her grandmother’s house in Matura village. The body was found Sunday in a pool of blood in the grandmother’s bedroom with deep stabs on the neck, forehead and stomach, all suspected to have been inflicted using a kitchen knife that was left in the murder scene. The victim, 16-year-old Lucy Wanjiku, was a student at the St Teresa Manunga Girls High School in Nyandarua. Nyandarua Central head of Directorate of Criminal Investigations Stansellous Mwangi said police recovered a kitchen knife at the scene of the murder. “She had a minor injury on the head but we suspect she died of the severe injuries on the throat. There are claims that she was pregnant but we are waiting for medical reports," said Mr Mwangi. Mr Mwangi said the bed was properly made but other items were scattered all over the room, a sign there was a physical struggle between the student and the assailant. One of the slain student’s relatives, Ms Emily Muthoni, said a stranger was seen hovering around the home for several hours before the murder incident. “The stranger later walked into the compound where he found some children playing and requested to know if the grandparents were in. He then walked into the house," said Ms Muthoni. Children who found the young girl’s body long after the stranger had left raised the alarm. The student lived with her mother at Sokomoko estate in Ol Kalou town but had gone to visit her grandmother when she was killed. Her grandfather, Francis Mwangi, said he received a call that his grandchild had been critically injured “I rushed home planning to take her to the hospital but found her lifeless body on the floor. She was very jovial in the morning when l left home,” said Mr Mwangi.
