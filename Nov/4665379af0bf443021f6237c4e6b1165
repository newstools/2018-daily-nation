IN MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE They thought they had qualified for the tournament’s quarter-finals and were just waiting to face their opponents in the last eight. But Kenya’s Equity Bank got a rude shock Thursday when they were told of their elimination, on a technicality, from the rather disorganized Fiba Africa Women’s Basketball Club Championships here, amid claims rival clubs had fixed a decisive match. Angered by the sudden turn of things, the bankers are now contemplating giving future continental club tournaments a wide berth and reconsidering their relationship with the Africa chapter of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). Equity Bank had beaten Congolese outfit Victoria Club 84-75, a victory they knew had guaranteed them a quarter-final berth. But they were shocked when Group ‘A’ whipping girls, Victoria Club of the Democratic Republic of Congo, emphatically beat a tough Forces Armed Police (FAP) of Cameroon 70-42, in what looked like a fixed game, a victory that locked the bankers out. Equity Bank’s head of sports Loise Araka was livid. "Just like Inter Club of Angola and Ferroviario of Maputo, we beat V-Club with a big margin, 84-75, and expected F.A.P., which by all standards were better than us, to walk over V-club or lose by a smaller margin,” a disappointed Araka said. V-club had lost all their matches 89-39 to Inter Club of Angola, 75-43 to Ferroviario of Mozambique and 84-75 to Equity Bank, while F.A.P. beat Equity Bank 77-44 after narrowly losing 76-66 to Group ‘A’ winners Inter Club and 71-49 to hosts Ferroviario. "We want FIBA to come clean on this, otherwise it will widen the already existing rift between the English and French speaking countries within the FIBA family,” a Nigerian official said. Equity Bank have since raised an official complaint with FIBA officials here and were awaiting the body's official word on the matter late Thursday.   Tip off time is 4.45 pm Kenyan time.
