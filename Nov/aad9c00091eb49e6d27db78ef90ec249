The prosecution did not oppose the request for adjournment. The court allowed the defence request and adjourned the case to be heard in February 2019. The suspects, who are out on bond, have also been directed to deposit their travel documents in court. The prosecution was directed to furnish the accused with witness statements and any exhibits that will be relied on to prove the case against the accused.
