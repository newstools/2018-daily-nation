World Under-20 3,000m steeplechase silver medallist Leonard Bett won men's Under-20 8km race during the Athletics Kenya Cross Country Series opening leg in Machakos on Saturday. Bett, who is also the World Under-20 2,000m steeplechase champion, weathered a thrilling three-horse battle with Youth Olympics 3,000m champion Jackson Kavesa and Edwin Kiplagat in the last two laps to triumph. After Kiplagat (Bomet) was dropped going into the last lap, Bett (Bomet) and Kavesa (Machakos) went shoulder-toshoulder before Bett affirmed his prowess in the last 200m to win in 23 minutes and 50.25 seconds. Kavesa would settle second in 23:54.51 as Kiplagat finished third in 24:07.42. "I think I love my progress since winning the medals at world youth and junior steeplechase races," said Bett, who finished fourth at Ndalat Gaa Cross Country Championships a month ago. Bett now turns his focus to the National Cross Country Championships due February next year with a view of earning a ticket to the World Cross Country Championships due March 30 in Aarhus, Denmark next year. Bett explained that he is also now ripe for senior championships as he targets African Games in August in Morocco and World Championships in October in Doha all next year. "I took part in the Diamond League finals in Zurich hence I feel capable of handling the senior category well," said Bett. Kavesa, a form three student at Kivandini Secondary School in Machakos, is also focusing on the Nationals and World Cross Country Championships.   Anyango's dream now is to go on and win at the Nationals.
