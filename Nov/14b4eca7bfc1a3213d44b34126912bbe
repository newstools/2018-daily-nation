Kenya’s World Under 20 10,000m champion Rhonex Kipruto is among five finalists nominated for the 2018 Male Rising Star Award. The winner will be announced during the IAAF Athletics Awards 2018 in Monaco on December 4 this year. Kipruto, 19, won the Africa Cross Country Under-20 men’s title in Chlef, Algeria in March, exerting revenge against Stanley Waithaka, who had beaten him at the Kenya Championships. Kipruto went on to win the 10,000m race during the Kenyan trials on his way to winning the World Under 20 10,000m title in a Championship Record time of 27:21.08 in Tampere, Finland. On September 8 in Czech, Kipruto affirmed his status as one of world’s most promising distance runners when he won the Prague Grand Prix 10km race in a course record time of 26:46, missing compatriot Leonard Patrick Komon’s World Record time of 26:44. The time is still the fastest in 10km Road Race this year.
