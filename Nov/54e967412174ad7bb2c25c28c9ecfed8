Police in Mombasa County have arrested at least 199 motorists for flouting traffic rules amid the renewed reinforcement of Michuki rules. Thousands of residents walked to work as members of the the Matatu Owners Association (MOA) withdrew more than 10,000 passenger service vehicles (PSVs). OFFENCES The government is cracking down on unroadworthy vehicles and Interior minister Fred Matiang'i says the operation will not end unless operators comply. Its checklist includes the inspection certificate, the speed governor, the continuous yellow line, seat belts, insurance and the uniform. County Police Commander Johnston Ipara said a multi-agency security was deployed to strategic areas to enforce the rules. “We arrested them for committing offences including lacking speed governors, seat belts, uniforms, reflectors, photographs and licences; having excess passengers, blinking lights and worn out tires and not displaying badges,” he said. He added that 365 cases of flouting the regulations had been reported and that most had been taken to court. ROUND THE CLOCK The police boss said the operation will be carried out day and night to restore sanity in the transport sector. Mr Ipara warned motorists, saying they will pay the price if caught. Most matatu operators parked their vehicles in petrol stations to avoid arrest. MOA National Vice-Chairman Salim Bates said 10 percent of the PSVs were found compliant. "Ninety percent of PSVs in the coast have not complied but 10 percent will operate," Mr Bates said. With the shortage, residents scrambled for personal vehicles, taxis and boda-bodas.   Kenyans forced to look for alternative means of transport amid matatu shortage.
