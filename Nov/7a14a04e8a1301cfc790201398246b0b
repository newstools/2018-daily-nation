The Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) is demanding the revocation of appointment of its former chairman Mudzo Nzili to the board of National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). In a letter dated November 28 to Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki, Knut Secretary-General Wilson Sossion regretted that despite having retired in May this year, Mr Nzili continues to sit on the board as a representative of teachers. “We are very disappointed in that you have not acknowledged receipt of the letter dated June 4 or taken necessary action,” said Mr Sossion. He went on: “The purpose of our letter is to demand for the revocation of representation to the NHIF board by our former chairman following his retirement and no longer represents the union.” Mr Sossion wants the name of current chairman Wycliffe Omucheyi to be gazetted in order to represent the union. Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) is represented in the board by is Secretary General Akelo Misori. The more than 312,000 teachers are members of NHIF. The nomination of teacher’s representative to the board is guided by section 4(1)of the NHIF Act No. 9 of the 1998 and the state law (miscellaneous) Act No 18 of 2014.
