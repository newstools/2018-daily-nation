Coast residents were left in agony after owners of public service vehicles withdrew their services for the second day running in protest over enforcement of traffic law. Hundreds of commuters had no choice but to walk to work as traffic police officers continued to enforce the strict â€˜Michuki rules.' However, candidates sitting ongoing Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations were ferried to various centres by police cars. Hundreds of PSV's were seen parked in petrol stations as their owners ignore decision to call off strike issued by the Matatu Owners Association on Monday evening. Mombasa County Police Commander Johnston Ipara said a multi-agency security team has been deployed in strategic areas to enforce the traffic rules. The police boss said the operations will be continue day and night to ensure sanity in the transport sector. "We are against some of the rules. Why should matatu owners, sacco and drivers be punished when a conductor does not wear uniform? We want clarity on the issue of yellow line, should it be continuous or broken?" asked Mr Salim Mbarak, the Coast regional coordinator of Matatu Owners Association. Mr Mbarak said 25 percent of Coast vehicles have complied with the rules but no vehicles were seen operating in Mombasa and other nearby towns. On Monday, police in the Mombasa County arrested 199 motorists for flouting traffic rules amid the renewed reinforcement of 'Michuki rule' ahead of the festive season when the number of road crashes spikes.   Operation will take place round the clock, police boss says.
