Mombasa County Assembly has passed a motion banning bars and night clubs from operating in residential areas, near religious places and educational institutions. If signed into law by governor Hassan Joho, bars and nightclubs in the areas affected by the ban will be shutdown. Popular nightclubs in Mombasa are likely to lose their licenses following the ban. Tabling the motion before the County Assembly, nominated MCA Mohamed Hatimy said bars and nightclubs should seize from operating in residential areas. The MCA urged members to prohibit operations of all bars, nightclubs within a radius of 300 metres in all residential areas, schools and places of worship. "Bars and nightclubs are allowed to operate in the county subject to certain conditions and restrictions. If these entertainments are left uncontrolled they will continue to pose a big threat to safety, tranquility and good morals of the youth and faithful in the residential areas" Mr Hatimy said. The motion was seconded by Old Town ward representative Amur Murfad. Nominated MCA Fatma Kushe said the assembly has received complaints from the members of the public over noise pollution. “Like in Tononoka there are many bars concentrated in residential areas near a mosque. We should protect religious places of worship, hospitals and residential areas from the noises. The entertainment joints must be removed. We would rather lose revenue but have sanity. We must respect God,” Ms Kushe said. She said people with sick relatives in hospitals and homes have been complaining they cannot sleep at night due to loud music from bars and nightclubs. However, some members objected the motion saying it would affect investors.
