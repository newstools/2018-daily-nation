Nakuru County has received more than Sh1 billion from the World Bank this financial year for urban growth projects. Lands chief officer Judyleah Waihenya said Nakuru and Naivasha municipalities will share part of the cash under the Kenya Urban Support Programme. PUBLIC'S ROLE Ms Waihenya said the public will play a key role in determining the projects that will be undertaken, with infrastructural development being a key component. “It is a five-year undertaking, whose success will largely depend on the cash absorption rate, World Bank already having released the money,” said Ms Waihenya. The official admitted the existence of “teething” problems, with six months left before the first phase of the project is undertaken. She told participants that the programme will also involve projects for job opportunities and better living conditions for the people in the two areas. “The bottom line is to implement projects that will be beneficial to the people and improve infrastructure, considering the increasing population,” she said. Naivasha's population has ballooned to 170,000. BOARD Lands executive Francis Mwangi noted that the programme will create job opportunities for youths. “Key areas include roads, waste management and the social component. Youths will be given opportunities to earn a living," he said. Naivasha Professionals Association Secretary-General Absalom Mukuusi called for the unveiling of the Town Board members, who will supervise the implementation of the World Bank programmes. “We are going to present a written memorandum on projects we feel should be prioritised,” he said. Citing challenges in sewer system management, former ward representative Simon Wanango rooted for proper systems. The funding is a major boost especially to Nakuru town which is set to gain city status.   County says it has put in place the necessary machinery to achieve the standing.
