Shock and grief engulfed Miyare village in Migori County on Thursday after two siblings drowned in a dam while fetching water. According to witnesses, one of the victims, a boy aged 6, was slipped and fell into the dam and his eight-year-old sister tried to save him before she also drowned. "One of the kids slipped and fell into the well. The other one was struggling to save him but unfortunately fell into the well. It's a very sad moment for the entire village," said Mr Bernard Otieno. Ms Iscah Akoth, the mother of the victims, said she became concerned when she noticed that her children had taken long to come back home. She went to find out and saw jerrycans floating on the water. "When I saw the jerrycans on water I immediately realised that the worst had happened," Ms Akoth said amid tears. Villagers retrieved the bodies from the dam. The bodies of the victims were taken to Rosewood Hospital Mortuary in Rongo.
