Nyandarua County Assembly leaders have decided to end their wrangles that have paralysed business for about three months. Senator Mwangi Githiomi and Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho mediated the 3am Sunday meeting, which was attended by Governor Francis Kimemia, his deputy Cecilia Mbuthia, Speaker Ndegwa Wahome and all 39 members of county assembly. "I am happy we are now one team. I appreciate what has happened today. We are going to work harder to fulfil our development mandates," Governor Kimemia said. NEW LEADERS The ward representatives had objected to Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki's involvement. Ms Kariuki had on several occasions offered to help resolve the conflict. "It was a Nyandarua affair and only Nyandarua people knew what was ailing them," Shamata MCA Gitau Njamba said. The problem came about after Mr Wahome refused to confirm the new House leadership since September. They are Majority Leader Kingâ€™ori Wambugu, his deputy Justus Gaita and nominated MCA Kariuki Ngaruiya. DEVELOPMENT The clergy and residents have welcomed the progress, saying it was long overdue. Chief Whip Wangari Methu said: "It was not a walk in the park because each party had taken a strong stand. We are thankful to Senator Githiomi and MP Kiaraho for their patience and wisdom; they brokered the peace deal." Kipipiri MCA Wambaire Ngeche said there were no losers. "There were sacrifices we made. But we are all happy it has come to a promising end. We also agreed that leaders should allow corruption allegations be investigated by the relevant bodies. Elected leaders are to hold monthly or quarterly meetings to rebrand Nyandarua," Mr Ngeche said.
