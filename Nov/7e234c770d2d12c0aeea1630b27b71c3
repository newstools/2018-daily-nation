The selection of candidates who will join Form One in 2019 will start on December 3, Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has said. Speaking at Star of the Sea Primary School in Mombasa while releasing the 2018 KCPE exam results Monday, Ms Mohamed said that the selection will be done only once unlike previously when there has been a second selection. The CS also revealed that over 50 percent of the candidates scored over 250 marks. In this yearâ€™s exam, boys performed better than girls in Mathematics while, on the other hand, girls did better in English and Kiswahili. At the same time, the Education CS revealed that none of the nine papers administered during the 2018 KCPE exam were leaked. Candidates can check their results by sending their index number to 20076.   The results have come early, as indicated in an announcement by the president on Sunday.
