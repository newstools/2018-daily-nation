Kenya has joined the rest of the world in renewing its commitment to the acceleration of environmental conservation to check climate change. The affirmation was given by none other than President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is currently in France for the World Peace Forum. And comes in the wake of the International Conference on Climate Change and Global Warming held in Paris over a week ago. The President says Kenya will continue to partner with other nations of the world in pushing for the use of green energy to curb global warming. The country has much to worry about its environment as years of the wanton destruction of its key water towers have seen forest cover shrink to 7.6 per cent. This compares dismally with the 10 per cent lower threshold recommended by the United Nations. The result has been the drying up of rivers, erratic rainfall and dwindling of water sources. Without doubt, these are some of the tell-tale signs that mark the onset of climate change. With such dire warnings, the country cannot afford to sit on the fence, as the effects of climate change are not only a threat to the current generation but the countryâ€™s posterity, too. It is worth pointing out that the government has in recent months rolled out measures aimed at achieving this critical goal. Crucial has been a campaign by Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko, which seeks to have some 1.8 billion trees planted in the next five years. This is commendable and must be implemented to the letter, as there is no easier option. Even then, more still needs to be done on environmental conservation, if we are to bequeath our future generations a country that is habitable.
