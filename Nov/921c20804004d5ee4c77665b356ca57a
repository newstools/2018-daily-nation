The wife of Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria has moved to court seeking to block her arrest. Ms Violet Nzisa Katua, who is facing arrest over failure to pay a crash victim, filed an appeal at the High Court seeking to challenge the decision by a lower court. Earlier this year, the court directed her to pay Sh738,000 in full to Ms Martha Onganga whom she knocked down with her Toyota Land Cruiser two years ago. COMPENSATION In the appeal dated November 12, Ms Nzisa through her lawyer Pascal Mbeche, wants the court to set aside the arrest orders issued by Senior Principal Magistrate Liz Gicheha for defaulting the payment. She faulted the court’s decision which said failed to consider her source of income and ability to pay the money in a monthly installments of Sh100,000. Ms Katua claim that she has faced difficulties in complying the orders since she is not in a position to raise the monthly installments. She had earlier informed the court that she is an employee of FON Creation Limited, a company which supply’s products to supermarkets within Nakuru where she earned a gross monthly salary of Sh 22,000. She was arrested on October 1 and was later freed on Sh 100,000 bond. The court issued another warrant against Ms Katua on November 12 after she failed to pay Sh80,000 to clear the instalment for the month of November. Ms Ongaga moved to court in 2016 seeking compensation for damages after Ms Katua knocked her down while was on her way to work. The officer claimed she sustained serious injuries from the crash and admitted to Kijabe hospital for five months. The case was ruled in her favour in October last year and the court ordered Ms Katua to pay the entire amount.   Violet Katua, wife of Nakuru Town East MP, ordered to duly compensate woman she knocked down with her vehicle.
