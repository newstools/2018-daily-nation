The Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination kicked off Monday morning with 664,585 candidates set to take the tests. Senior government officials led by Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed were in various counties to supervise the opening of exam containers for distribution to schools. Education CS Amina Mohamed witnessed the opening of KCSE exam storage container in Mombasa County. Ms Mohamed, who was accompanied by Foreign Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary Ababu Namwamba, said her ministry is working on a policy that will be introduced to deal with teenage pregnancies in schools. She said the policy will be rolled out at an "appropriate time". Some 20 primary school girls gave birth during the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams last week. Ms Mohamed has ordered the 459 examination containers to be opened daily at 6am.   Basic Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang started the day in Kisii County where he is set to visit select exam centres while the Teachers Service Commission chief executive Nancy Macharia supervised container opening in Nyeri.   Kenya National Examination Council (Knec) chairman George Magoha was in Busia town while National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich was in Ainabkoi in Uasin Gishu County where he opened the KCSE container. The director of Kenya Institute of Curriculum, Julius Jwan, was in Embu town.   During the examination, there will be 10,078 centre managers, 10,460 supervisors, 37,978 invigilators, 20,156 security personnel, 5,039 drivers and their total dues will be Sh705 million. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator Mongo Chimwaga said security is tight in areas of Narok South, Olposimoru and in Nakuru, areas that were recently hit by clashes.   One teacher sacked, 45 more to serve suspensions as TSC acts tough on those who facilitated cheating in the 2017 KCSE exams.
