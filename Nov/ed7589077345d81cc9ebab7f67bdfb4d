Two children are among four people who were killed on Wednesday night when a lorry rammed houses in Mukurweini, Nyeri County. Three families were left homeless following the crash that occurred a few minutes to 7pm. According to witnesses, the truck was ferrying ballast from Mukurweini to Nyeri when it crashed near Tambaya Bridge. They said the truck belongs to a road construction company that has been repairing the Nyeri-Mukurweini road. Mr David Karuga, a local, said the driver of the lorry was speeding when he lost control of it and hit a pedestrian before landing on the houses. “It just flew and hit a man on the road and went trough the houses. The two children were watching television in the house,” he said. The children and the pedestrian died on the spot while the driver of the lorry succumbed to injuries at the hospital, Mukurweini police boss Issa Muhammud said.
