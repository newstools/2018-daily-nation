Teachers’ unions have demanded that candidates who did not sit for this year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations be given supplementary tests as directed by President Kenyatta last year. Some 8,347 pupils who registered for the exams did not turn up for the tests, while others did them in hospitals. The Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) and Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) officials said it’s wrong for the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) to deny candidates supplementary examinations, yet they are done in colleges and universities. Kuppet chairman Omboko Milemba said the candidates missed the examinations for different reasons and ought to be given a second chance. ABSENTEE CANDIDATES While releasing the results in Mombasa, Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed said the number of absentee candidates decreased by 14.18 per cent from 9,726 in 2017. “I have asked the quality assurance and standards directorate in the ministry to track down the candidates,” the minister said. Knec chairman, Prof George Magoha, on Monday indicated that there will be no supplementary examinations despite having assured the country last year that plans were underway to introduce them. “The President has directed the CS and his ministry to set supplementary examinations for a special cadre of students who because of compassionate reasons may have difficulties doing exams during the normal calendar,” said a statement from State House last year. SECOND CHANCEKnut secretary-general Wilson Sossion said it is wrong to have sick candidates and those who have delivered sit for the examinations.“The government must put in place mechanisms to ensure that such candidates are given a second chance to do exams when they are at peace,” Mr Sossion said. Over the years, the affected students have had to re-register for the tests the following year.   Neighbours say the girl spent Sunday night at her boyfriend’s house.
