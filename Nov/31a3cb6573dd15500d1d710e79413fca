Deputy President William Ruto has asked male members of parliament (MP) to steer support for the two thirds gender rule bill that will be tabled in the National Assembly on Tuesday. Speaking at Nyakoora Catholic Church in Kitutu Chache North Constituency, Kisii County, on Saturday, he noted that such a law would help Kenya reach its full potential in development. LOYAL, HARDWORKING Mr Ruto said male legislators have a habit of "running away" from women's issues yet "no man can survive without a woman, be it as a mother, a sister or a wife". “Women are the most loyal, hardworking and trusted people. Let us all support them in this,” he said. The deputy president returned to Kisii exactly a week after he toured for development purposes. He was received by Kisii Governor James Ongwae, who is from Kitutu Chache North. The governor said he will continue working with the government for the sake of growth for his people. "PASS BILL" Mr Ruto was hosted by area lawmaker Jimmy Angwenyi, who is the longest serving MP in the 12th parliament. “I urge Mr [Angwenyi], who had opposed the two thirds gender rule, to lead other MPs in passing it on Tuesday,” he said. Majority Leader Aden Duale (Garissa Town) is the sponsor of the bill aimed at ending the gender imbalance in the management of government affairs. Mr Ruto said, "Let us ensure women take their rightful positions in leadership." The deputy president will also tour Bobasi and Bomachoge Borabu constituencies, where he will be hosted by MPs Innocent Obiri and Prof Zadock Ogutu respectively. He will lead a series of fund drives in the areas.   ODM politicians claim Ruto is not sincere about his development talk.
