Hi Brenda, I’m 20 years old. I'm afraid of getting into a serious relationship because I always assume that the guys around me aren’t serious. Please help a sister.  Hi! My advice is, the earlier you start weeding out the chaff from the useful grain, the better for you. You see, the thing is, with relationships, you can never be sure of what's going to happen. And everyone is different. And no one is perfect – not even you, my dear. You may be looking at someone thinking that they're not serious, and they're probably looking at you thinking you're not serious either. People are often improved by association – you never know what you could bring out in someone, and what they could bring out in you. The game of love is a game of numbers, and to win, you must at least play. Even the non-serious ones are a lesson – just guard your heart a little bit and jump in. *** Do you have a problem to share with Brenda?
