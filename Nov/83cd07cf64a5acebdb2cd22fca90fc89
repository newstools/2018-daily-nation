Four prospective Kenya Defence Force recruits were arrested in Bomet on Tuesday morning for presenting forged academic documents. Two suspects were arrested at Bomet Green Stadium during recruitment of servicemen and servicewomen, and constables which started on Monday. The recruitment in Bomet Central attracted 650 youths. SECURITY The other suspects were nabbed when they presented forged documents in Mogogosiek, Konoin Sub-County. Lt-Col Fred Muchera said the suspects were handed over to the county security team. “The candidates were trying to join KDF by presenting forged academic documents which after analysis did not match the age captured in their national identity cards,” Col Mucheru said. He said one of the suspects presented Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education papers indicating that the person had sat for the Form Four exams at age 13. On Monday, Vice Chief of Defence Forces, Lt-Gen Robert Kibochi warned that there was an increase in the number of people soliciting money from the public by claiming they could secure places for them in the forces. He said that 20 cases of malpractices were reported during the February/March recruitment, with Kenyans losing over Sh4.2 million to con men. This was an increase from the nine cases reported during the May/June 2017 recruitment, when Kenyans lost Sh4.9 million. “Seven civilians have so far been charged and some KDF soldiers who were implicated have been dismissed from service,” Lt-Gen Kibochi said during the launch.   Public warned against fraudsters ready to prey on their desperation for jobs.
