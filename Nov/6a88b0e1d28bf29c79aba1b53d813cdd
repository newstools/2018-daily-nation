ANC Leader Musalia Mudavadi on Sunday called on churches to reject contributions from leaders perceived to be corrupt. He said such leaders are using loot to create the impression that they are development conscious. In an attack directed at Deputy President William Ruto, who has been at the forefront in giving out huge contributions to churches, Mr Mudavadi asked church leaders to be brave enough and decline cash from such leaders. He said such leaders’ wealth acquisition record is questionable. “You can’t be telling us you are investing in heaven by giving out large sums of money that you can’t account for,” he said. BE CAREFUL “The church should be careful with these people masquerading as being wealthy and giving out money that they have stolen from public coffers,” said Mr Mudavadi. Speaking at Kenya Assemblies of God Church in Buruburu, Mr Mudavadi called on the agencies tasked with fighting corruption to start investigating such leaders without fearing their senior positions in government. The former Vice-President also lamented that 60 per cent of the country's GDP is being channelled towards loan repayment. He called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to intensify the fight against corruption to ensure that any money borrowed for development is not misappropriated by few corrupt individuals in government. He lamented that the country‘s debt level has hit an all-time high, and called on the government to control its borrowing to avoid overburdening the mwanachi.   The DP says he is not ashamed of his faith.
