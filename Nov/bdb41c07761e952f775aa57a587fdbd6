The national Rugby 15s team, Kenya Simbas, suffered their second consecutive defeat on Saturday, losing to Hong Kong 42-17 in a 2019 World Cup qualifier in France. The Simbas, who the previous Saturday lost 65-19 to Canada, are out of contention for the Rugby World Cup in Japan next year.For the umpteenth time, Kenya have fallen at their last hurdle, failing to qualify for the world cup, after coming close in 2015. After being defeated by Namibia in the Africa qualifiers, Kenya chose the toughest path to Japan. Realistically, it was impossible for the Simbas to even dream about making it from France.Kenyan standards are still wanting. The quick fixes the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) opted for did not help at all. Signing two coaches from New Zealand and expecting them to perform miracles and help Kenya qualify for Japan within three months after paying them millions was futile. The coaches spent most of their time trying to fix the fitness level of players with little time to impart technical skills. Their job was made even worse with no build-up matches either ahead of the Africa qualifiers or in France.Many developed rugby nations have well-structured and practical systems developed both for players and coaches right from the low to top levels.The KRU will need a different approach to the gameâ€™s development if the country is to compete effectively at this high level. Our local leagues are oozing with talent but need to be restructured with good sponsorship to make them more vibrant and competitive. Local leagues need good investments both in capital and human resources for the game to grow.
