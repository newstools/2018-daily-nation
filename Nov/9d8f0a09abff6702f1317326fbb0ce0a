A bid to bar Nation journalists from covering trial of suspects linked to the loss of Sh226.9 million at the National Youth Service has failed. Nairobi Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti on Friday declined to have Nation journalists — Mr Sam Kiplagat and Mr Brian Wasuna — cross-examined following complaints by some defence lawyers that the two have been biased in their reporting. Nation has been relentless in the fight against corruption, crimes and other forms of social injustices, a stance that has made some sections of society uncomfortable. It was Nation that first reported that up to Sh10 billion may have been lost in the NYS, a figure that was met with scepticism and denials by authorities. But this week, the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji revealed that as much as Sh8 billion has been lost in the NYS I and II financial scandals. Mr Ogoti also declined an application to adjourn the trial as defence lawyers sought more time to respond to the new charges levelled against their clients. Thirty-five suspects were charged afresh earlier this week with Mr Haji withdrawing charges for eight suspects who agreed to become state witnesses.   Scheme saw grand collusion beginning with low-level staff to senior managers
