Police in Kwale County are investigating the gruesome murder of an elderly woman in Chikwakwani village, Mtaa sub-location Kinango Sub-County. The 88-year-old woman, identified as Umazi Nyanje, was hacked to death at her home while taking supper with her granddaughter on Tuesday night. THREE MEN Kwale County Commissioner Karuku Ngumo said the deceased was attacked by three men armed with pangas. He said police officers were informed of the incident by Mtaa assistant chief Mr Jonathan Kombe. "When police visited the scene, they established that the deceased was taking supper with her granddaughter when three unknown men broke into the house and attacked her with a panga," said Mr Ngumo. Mr Ngumo said the body had deep cuts on the head and neck. He said that police have launched investigations. The motive of the killing has not yet been established. There are suspicions, however, that the deceased could have fallen victim to a vigilante-style attack following similar killings in the area targeting elderly people suspected of practicing witchcraft. WITCHCRAFT Police records indicate at least 42 elderly people have been killed since January this year on suspicions of practicing witchcraft. Kinanago and Lunga Lunga sub-counties are the hardest hit by the vice that has left both locals and security agencies at a crossroads. Mr Ngumo condemned the killing of elderly people and urged leaders in the county to help eradicate inhuman and retrogressive cultural practices. The body was moved to Kinango Hospital mortuary awaiting a postmortem.   Most are threatened with death on suspicion that they engage in witchcraft
