A secondary school principal from Kuresoi North, Nakuru County and three other suspects have been arrested over exam malpractices. A supervisor, invigilator, and a class teacher will spend the night in police cells after they were arrested for allowing an impersonator to write KCSE test at St Chesirikwa Secondary School. Kuresoi police boss Hesbon Kadenge said a student had registered for the examination as a private candidate, but went to participate in athletics in Japan. The police boss said the class teacher jointly with the candidateâ€™s coach brought someone else to do the examinations on her behalf. Mr Kadenge said the girl had been sitting for the examination without detection since it started. He said police have opened investigation into the matter. The four suspects will be arraigned on Thursday morning.   The four were found with mobile phones in exam room.
