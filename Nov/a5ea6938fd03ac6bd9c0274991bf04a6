The national women football may after all not take part in the 2018 Africa Women's Cup of Nations set to kick-off on November 17 to December 1 in Ghana. This is after the Confederation of Africa Football (Caf) on Wednesday overturned a decision of the Disciplinary Council on September 8 which found Equatorial Guinea guilty of fielding an ineligible player therefore handing Harambee Starlets the chance to take part in this year's Awcon. Wednesday's decision means that Equitorial Guinea, who were replaced by Kenya in Gr(oup B of the continental showpiece, will now battle it out with South Africa, champions Nigeria and Zambia for a place in the last four. Football Kenya Federation had protested against the eligibility of Annette Jacky Messomo during Starlets' Awcon qualifying match against Equatorial Guinea. "The player Annette Jacky Messomo is eligible to play for the National Team of Equatorial Guinea. The National Team of Equatorial Guinea is reintegrated in the Total African Women's Cup of Nations 2018," Caf said in a statement. Starlets had on Wednesday evening battled to a 1-1 draw against visiting Black Queens of Ghana at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani in preparation for the Cup of Nations. Starlets participated in the last edition of the women's continental football bonanza where they lost all three matches. Earlier this week, cash-strapped FKF appealed to the government to release Sh43 million to help the team prepare for the tournament.   Harambee Starlets, require Sh43 million to effectively compete at the 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations
