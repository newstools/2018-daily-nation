Two petitioners have moved to court to challenge the enactment of the Kakamega County Assembly Lake Region Economic Bloc Act 2018, arguing that it was unlawful and unconstitutional. Mr Boniface Manda and Mr Musa Ekaya want the Kakamega county government blocked from releasing Sh200 million to the regional bloc, saying the law was purportedly enacted by the county assembly in contravention of the Constitution. The county assembly debated and passed the bill in August and was assented to law by Governor Wycliffe Oparanya on August 29.
