The Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) is contemplating meeting pastoralist communities and other parties to discuss insecurity, following an attack in Garissa County. KRCS volunteer Ifran Adan was shot and wounded on Saturday morning after suspected Al-Shabaab fighters opened gunfire on a vehicle in Ruqa. JOINT EFFORT Two other staff members - Mohamed Faud and Daniel Jilo (driver) - were not shot but they suffered minor injuries as the driver sped off. Mr Hassan Musa, the KRCS regional coordinator, said they will not be discouraged but that community discussions will help prevent such attacks. “Although we may not be the target, we shall meet the community and other stakeholders to see how to tackle the insecurity issue together,” he told journalists at Tawfique Hospital in Malindi, Kilifi County, where the casualties were taken. Ms Adan was shot at about 9am as the group travelled to Ijara from Masalani to asses the organisation's projects. Speaking to the press at the hospital where she was admitted, she said they heard gunshots from a bush and realised she was shot after the driver sped off. “The only thing that came to mind was our safety. I never imagined such could happen to us," she said. GUNSHOTS Mr Jilo said he reversed and sped off after hearing the gunshots. “I had driven about one and a half kilometers after dropping three passengers along Masalani-Ijara road when we heard the shots," he said. "I reversed and heard another gunshot from a different assailant.” Mr Jilo said he later picked the three passengers and drove to Masalani before the vehicle broke down. “We then put the victim in a saloon car which was passing by and decided to walk in a group of five. We later saw a matatu which ferried us to a safe place," he said.   One person shot and injured.
