A lovers' feud ended tragically when a man stabbed his former girlfriend's son to death in Nakuru County on Saturday night. The man, whom residents said was a jailbird, killed himself when residents gathered and tried to flush him out of the house in Karagita on the outskirts of Naivasha town. KNIFE ATTACK A neighbour, Susan Wangari, said the man stormed the woman's house at about 7pm. Ms Wangari said he broke in, armed with a knife, as the woman and her two children slept. The woman and her 13-year-old daughter woke up and ran out of the house when they realised an intruder was there. "The jilted lover turned his anger on the helpless minor, stabbing him three times as his mother and sibling cried for help," she said. Ms Wangari narrated how the girl returned to the house, picked up her brother and took him to hospital. The six-year-old was pronounced dead on arrival. SUICIDE The attacker turned the knife on himself when he sensed danger after neighbours gathered. "He knew the mob would kill him so he decided to take his own life," said Ms Wangari, who is also a social worker. The man was reportedly angered by his lover's decision to end their relationship after accusing him of turning violent. Janet Mlongo, the Naivasha Assistant County Commissioner in charge of the central region, said, "The woman was his target but she escaped so he turned his anger on an innocent child." Ms Mlongo told the Nation that the man, nicknamed "Snake", was released from prison two months ago. The bodies were taken to the Naivasha Sub-county Hospital mortuary.   Kariobangi, Eastleigh, Dandora, Kayole and Kawangware are some of the hotspots in Nairobi.
