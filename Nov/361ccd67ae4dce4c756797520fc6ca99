The clampdown on errant public transport motorists nearly turned tragic in Mumias on Tuesday, as a matatu driver sped off with a female police officer in his car. The officer had been asked to escort the vehicle to a police station. HOT PURSUIT The policewoman was among several officers assigned to a road block at Lukoye on Mumias-Bungoma road in Kakamega County. They flagged down the matatu for non-compliance with transport rules. "I assigned the officer the task of leading the vehicle to the police station but the driver decided to speed off with her to an unknown destination," said Mumias Traffic Base Commander Agnes Habbat. Ms Habbat said other officers and boda-boda riders pursued the driver and caught up with him at Shitsitswi market, about 10km from the scene of the 'kidnap'. The driver reportedly attempted to push the officer out of the matatu. "She sustained bruises on her neck and chest from the struggle with the driver, who attempted to throw her out of the moving vehicle," Ms Habbat said. The man escaped but police arrested two people who were in the vehicle. The officer was treated at St Mary's Hospital and discharged.   Matatus keep off the roads in Mombasa for second day running.
