The coast’s top performer in the national primary school tests hopes to join Alliance High, the school of his dreams, and study civil engineering. Hassan Wanini Mvurya, 14, scored 440 out of 500 marks in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations, whose results were announced on Monday. SUSTAINED RECORD Hassan, the son of Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, was the best student in the county and the coastal region. In an interview with the Nation at their home in Diani on Tuesday, flanked by his mother Christine Mvurya, he said he had hoped for higher marks. Teachers and pupils of Mekaela Likunda School in Ukunda broke into song and dance when they learnt of his impressive performance. They took the celebrations to the home. Hassan's teacher Joshua Nzioka said he had been the best in his class since joining the school. The boy faced stiff competition but remained a top performer throughout his primary education, he said. "We are very thankful for the sterling performance of the school. We are very proud of Hassan, and his parents for bringing up such a gifted son," he said.   MOTIVATION Hassan attributed his good grades to his parents, classmates and teachers, saying they motivated him. “I am very happy and excited that I will finally be able to join the high school of my choice and shape my dream of becoming an engineer," he said. The boy also thanked God and his parents. His mother Christine described him as disciplined, hardworking and a role model in the family. "More important is to pray and seek guidance from God. I kept encouraging him, telling him he had the potential to do well and he did it," she said.   Usual pattern emerges with girls leading the way in languages and boys shining in maths.
