The African Unionâ€™s new infrastructure envoy, Mr Raila Odinga, has hit the ground running, challenging investors to stop concentrating housing projects in the cities and instead shift attention to satellite towns. This, Mr Odinga says, will ease congestion and demographic pressures that have made life unbearable for city populations, more so the low income earners. In Kenya, as in many other African states, the congestion is so endemic. Thanks mainly to poor planning and unchecked population growth, the urban centres are literally bursting at the seams, as they struggle to accommodate populations that by far outstrip their capacity. Though they consider themselves city dwellers, they hardly get any services deserving of that status. POOR SANITATION Many can only afford to live in slums, where poor sanitation and lack of social amenities confine them to life in unhygienic conditions that expose them to infections and other health complications. Having these decent and affordable housing outside the big cities would go a long way in making life better for both the city dwellers and residents of the satellite towns themselves. With reliable transport, more of these people can live away from the cities and commute to work daily without any inconvenience at all. SATELLITE TOWNS This has worked well for the developed nations where mass public transport systems ensure that populations in their millions commute effortlessly over long distance to and from work. But even as the focus shifts to the satellite towns, emphasis must be placed on proper planning in terms of good roads, infrastructure, sanitation and social amenities. Only this way would we ensure the satellite towns themselves do not go down the same chaotic path as the cities.
