A Nakuru court has issued a warrant for the arrest of Violet Nzisa, the wife of Nakuru Town East member of Parliament David Gikaria, over failure to pay an accident victim Sh700,000. Senior Principal Magistrate Liz Gicheha ordered the arrest also because Ms Nzisa did not appear in court on Monday to give reasons for the lack of payment. PART PAYMENTS Neither Ms Nzisa nor her lawyer Pascal Mbeche were in court when the order was issued. Ms Martha Ongaga sued Ms Nzisa in 2016, after she knocked her down with her Toyota Land Cruiser as she used a motorcycle for transport. She won the case in October last year, when the court ordered the accused to compensate her Sh738,739 as compensation. On October 5, the court ordered Ms Nzisa to clear the debt in monthly installments of Sh100,000 after she pleaded for this arrangement. She claimed she was unable to make a lump sum payment. However, Ms Ongaga told the court that Ms Nzisa had only given her Sh20,000 and that she had refused to pay the remaining Sh80,000 for October. On November 8, the court gave Ms Nzisa three days to pay the amount but it emerged last Friday that she had also not paid the victim Sh80,000 for November. SECOND WARRANT This is the second time that an arrest warrant has been issued against the lawmakerâ€™s wife. Ms Nzisa was apprehended on September 28 and taken to court for contempt but was granted release on a Sh100,000 bond. In the ruling on Monday, the magistrate cancelled the bond terms and said Ms Nzisa should be arrested immediately. Ms Ongaga notes, in her court documents, that she suffered serious injuries that resulted in a stay at Kijabe Hospital for five months. She returned to court seeking to have Ms Nzisa punished for contempt, prompting the issuing of the warrant for her arrest.   Violet Katua, wife of Nakuru Town East MP, ordered to duly compensate woman she knocked down with her vehicle.
