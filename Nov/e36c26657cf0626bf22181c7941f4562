Kenyan football clubs will never learn. At a time when Gor Mahia FC should be preparing for their Confederation of Africa Football (Caf) Champions League opener in two weeks’ time, they are being forced to search for a new coach. The club's coach, Daylan Kerr, who has been with them for 16 months, resigned on Friday. From 79 matches with the club, Mr Kerr managed 51 wins, 16 draws and 12 losses. He also took them to the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup. All has not been well at the club as the coach had earlier complained of delayed salaries for the technical bench and the players. Gor Mahia have now had five coaches in six years, a very high turnover. AFC Leopards have fared much worse, with 25 coaches in nine years. Gor Mahia face Nyasa Bullets of Malawi on November 28 in a CAF Champions League preliminary round match in Nairobi. Gor Mahia lost to Esperance of Tunisia 2-1 in this year’s Caf Champions League to see them drop to the Confederation Cup. Esperance went on to beat eight times champions Al Ahly of Egypt 4-3 in the final to lift their third Champions League crown. Success for the North African teams does not come on a silver platter. They invest heavily in their teams and treat their coaches and players well. Their focus isn’t so much on the winners prize tag of Sh250 million but the pride and prestige that comes along. It is not by chance that Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco all made it to the World Cup in Russia. Kenyan clubs and the soccer officials should learn from their north African counterparts.
