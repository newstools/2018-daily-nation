Bandari FC head coach Bernard Mwalala has raided his former club Nzoia Sugar FC and signed two players. Speaking at Serani Sports Grounds in Mombasa on Wednesday after their pre-season friendly match against second tier outfit Coast Stima, Mwalala confirmed the capture of goalkeeper Mustafa Oduor and central defender Brian Otieno from the Bungoma-based club. “I’m sure the two players will easily adapt to my style of play as well as gel with the rest of the boys. I’ve worked with them before and I know what they can do,” he told Nation Sport. Mwalala said that he was that he has not lost single player from his team that finished second in the 2018 Sportpesa Premier League. He was, however, non-committal on whether he will cull any player from his current squad. At the same time, Mwalala did not disclose if he will offer contracts to a number of players currently undergoing trials at the club or he will send them to Bandari Youth. The youth side takes part in the FKF Mombasa Premier League. He will be banking on the stars that helped Bandari finish runners up in the 2018 Sportpesa Premier League. Among last season’s stand out performers include shot stopper Farouk Shikalo, defenders Fred Nkata and Felly Mulumba. Shabaan Kenga and Wycliffe Ochomo will be tasked with goal poaching duties. The Dockers kick off the 2018/2019 SPL campaign against defending champions Gor Mahia in Mombasa.
