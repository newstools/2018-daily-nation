A Baringo ward representative has been hospitalised after three colleagues beat him up in the county assembly. The Silale Ward MCA Nelson Lotela was rushed to Baringo County Referral Hospital on Wednesday after his colleagues assaulted him over differences on Tuesday's disbandment of the county public service board. Mr Lotela supported the motion to disband the board and create a new one. Jubilee Party has nominated one rep to the new board that has not yet been set up while Kanu is expected to nominate one representative. Mr Lotela, who is a Kanu ward rep, was beaten by his colleagues who were unable to agree on a representative to the new board after two factions emerged in Wednesday voting. One of the factions wanted the member who was in board Mr Solomon Makal to be voted back while Mr Lotela's faction fronted Mr Shadrack Mailuk. Each of the fronted candidates got five votes. Mr Lotela wanted Kanu to present the two nominees to the county assembly to decide on one but that angered his colleagues who feared ward reps would reject Mr Makal.
