The government has barred children from accessing beaches at night in Kwale County citing a need to protect them from harm. Kwale County Commissioner Karuku Ngumo warned parents against letting their children stay in the beaches past 6pm. He said the move is one of the measures to guarantee their safety and those other beach goers during the long December holiday. Mr Ngumo said parents have a responsibility to closely monitor the behaviour of their children to save them from harm during the festive season. "Action will be taken against those children found at the beaches past the set time and parents who neglect their duties will be prosecuted," he said. Mr Ngumo called on the public and leaders across the county to support the government on matters of security. The Kenya Community Support Centre (Kecosce) welcomed the decision, saying it will work with security officers to ensure children are kept off the beach at night. Kecosce development manager Joseph Sianda urged parents to keep their children busy to keep them off of drugs and crime. "We need to monitor and keep vigil on our youngsters not to fall into temptations and engage in vices that will ruin their future even as they enjoy their holiday," he said. The county commissioners said officers will conduct regular patrols enforce the ban and also thwart any security threats on beach goers.
