An Indian citizen with a pending criminal case was on Wednesday arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as he tried to leave the country. Detectives said Mr Jatinder Sigh Gill, 29, was trying to evade theft charges of vehicle spare parts worth Sh2 million from Rift Valley Agricultural Contractors Limited in Narok South. He is also facing charges of being in the country illegally and working without a work permit. Narok County Police Commander Thomas Ngeiwua said police arrested him as he was preparing to flee the country for Oman but he was intercepted before he boarded the plane. The police boss said five other suspects were arrested alongside the Indian man after they were caught red-handed removing spare parts from tractors. He said the suspect will be arraigned in court for theft charges as well as operating in the country without a work permit. Mr Ngeiwua said the DCI is also investigating how police at Ololulung Police Station issued a police bail to the suspect for two weeks before he appeared in court. The Director of Rift Valley Agricultural Contractors Limited Jeff Karanja Thiru said the theft has destabilised operations at the farm and the company cannot continue with its operations.
