Top seed Kenya's Sneha Kotecha is in line for her third title after she beat Oceane Mallevre from France in straight sets at Nairobi Club on Tuesday to reach the third round of the ITF East Africa Junior Circuit 18 and Under tournament. Kotecha ran through the French girl 6-1, 6-0 and will now meet Chyara Onia Seke from Belgium for a place in the quarter-finals. Oseke upset 13th seed Suzaine Prestorius from South Africa 6-3, 7-6 (6). "I used my good serves to dispatch the equally good Mallevre," said Kotecha, who reached the final in one of the similar events in January before winning two ITF East Africa Junior Circuit 18 and Under titles in July. "I have no pressure as top seed since I have been playing well." The morning rains halted most of the second round matches.
