Former Mining Cabinet Secretary Dan Kazungu has denied claims that he irregularly spent Sh7 million to acquire a top-of-the-range car without paying tax during his time at the ministry. Auditor-General Edward Ouko’s report for the financial year 2015/16 says that Mr Kazungu and his then colleague at Water and Natural Environment, Prof Judi Wakhungu, had Sh7 million paid for their cars without withholding the 30 per cent tax of Sh2.1 million as required. Early this year, President Uhuru Kenyatta dropped Prof Wakhungu and Mr Kazungu from his Cabinet and appointed them ambassadors to France and Tanzania, respectively. On Thursday, Mr Kazungu said the car allowance for the Cabinet Secretary was revised to Sh14 million following a letter received from the Head of Public Service, Mr Joseph Kinyua. “I utilised this allowance to purchase a Range Rover and all the payments to the dealer were done by the Mining ministry. A total of Sh4.2 million in taxes was withheld by the ministry,” he said.
