The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is enjoying growing confidence in its ability to tackle cases without fear or favour. Indeed, there is great admiration of the job DPP Noordin Haji has been doing since his appointment in recent months. Besides boldly handling high-profile cases, the DPP has demonstrated that in pursuit of those suspected of engaging in corruption or looting public coffers, there will be no sacred cows. A number of high-profile personalities are already going through due process and the public now believes that the cases will be fairly handled and that those culpable will face the full wrath of the law. The work of the DPP has been made easier with the co-operation from an invigorated Directorate of Criminal Investigations. The partnership between DCI boss George Kinoti and Mr Haji is proving quite formidable. It will, therefore, come as a big disappointment to learn that there is a high staff turnover at the DPPâ€™s office. With nearly 80 lawyers exiting in the past few years in search of greener pastures, this is going to directly undermine the ability of the directorate to prosecute the many cases that have given hope to Kenyans that the judicial system now has the teeth and will bite criminals. Every effort should be made to ensure that the ability of the directorate is not blunted through the loss of some of its more talented, experienced and resourceful lawyers. One way is to review their terms of service and remuneration. After all, there are government agencies such as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, which pay much better than what the state lawyers earn. To ensure stability and sustain the momentum in the prosecution of corruption and other cases, the exodus from the directorate should be stemmed.
