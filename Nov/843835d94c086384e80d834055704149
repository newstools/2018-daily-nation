A teachersâ€™ union has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta, his deputy William Ruto and Cabinet secretaries to keep off secondary schools during the KCSE examination period, which enters the second week. Speaking in Nandi on Sunday, Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Chairman Omboko Milema said the government has militarised the administration of national exams. "The presence of Mr Kenyatta, his deputy and those of Cabinet secretaries do not add any value to the Form Four candidates writing the KCSE exams. The union had established that students panic for over 30 minutes whenever such officials visit their schools," Mr Milemba said during the Nandi County annual general meeting at King Solomon hotel. Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were at Uhuru Gardens and Musa Gitau primary schools, respectively, during the start of the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education on October 31, to wish the candidates success. EXPENSES Instead, he asked Mr Kenyatta to invest government resources in fighting corruption, which is causing suffering among Kenyans. He also observed that the officials incur more expenses during the visits, which defeats the government's austerity plans. On integrity, Mr Milema said the union does not condone exam cheating. Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association chairman Kahi Indimuli also asked principals not to tolerate any form of malpractice. "Let heads stay away from these people who are out to destroy their careers by involving them in cheating," Mr Indimuli said. Additional reporting by Ouma Wanzala
