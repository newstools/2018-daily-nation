In an apparent case of double tragedy, an elderly couple thrown into mourning after the death of their 36-year-old daughter have been unable to give her a proper send-off because a private hospital in Nairobi has detained her body due to an unpaid bill. Mr Edward Ng’ang’a and his wife Janet said Thursday that their daughter Loice Wanja underwent open heart surgery at Mater Hospital on July 30 but succumbed on September 21. The couple said they opted not to do an autopsy as it was expensive and they were yet to clear the Intensive Care Unit bill. She left behind a bill of Sh10 million. “So far we have paid Sh6 million,” Mr Ng’ang’a said. “We have sold property, our sons have taken loans to clear the bill but it keeps on rising,” he added. Efforts to get comments from the hospital management were futile.
