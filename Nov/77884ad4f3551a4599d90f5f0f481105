Kenyan clubs Kariobangi Sharks and Gor Mahia will this week start their continental football campaigns at home against strong opponents. Kariobangi Sharks take on Arta/Solar7 from Djibouti on Tuesday in the 2018/2019 Caf Confederations Cup, while Gor Mahia will play against Nyasa Big Bullets from Malawi in the 2018/2019 Caf Champions League preliminary round on Wednesday. Both matches will be at Kasarani Stadium, Nairobi. Kariobangi and Gor will then play away matches a week later, and the winners will proceed to the first round the Group Stage of the championships. Gor Mahia lost to Tunisia’s Esperance 2-1 in the second leg of 2017/2018 Caf Champions League, dropping to the Confederation Cup, where they reached the Group Stage. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Esperance went on to beat eight-time champions Al Ahly of Egypt 4-3 in the final to lift their third Champions League crown. It will be the first time Kariobangi are taking part in a continental tournament. We wish the two teams the best of luck, hoping. We hope Gor Mahia will put behind them the resignation of coach Daylan Kerr, after 16 months, and go for it. Kerr resigned to join Black Leopards in South Africa after a difficult time at Gor. He had been grappling with the challenge of delayed salaries and allowances for both the technical bench and players. PENDING ISSUES With home-grown coach Zedekiah “Zico” Otieno taking over at Gor Mahia, the management must resolve the pending issues so that the technical bench and the players do their best. The coaches and players deserve fair remuneration, including allowances besides good training facilities. Kariobangi Sharks should know that continental championships are a different game ball altogether and apply the seriousness required. The players will need ample time, facilitation and encouragement to excel.
