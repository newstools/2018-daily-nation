Deputy President William Ruto returns to Kisii, Nyamira and Migori Counties Saturday where he is expected to participate in fund raising events. His first stop will be Kendege Techinical Training Institute in Migori County where he will commission the college. Kuria East MP Marwa Kitayama will be present during the event. Mr Rutoâ€™s visit in Migori comes just four days after he left the region in what he said was a development tour. Some local leaders have criticised him, including Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, over his frequent political tours across the country, which the MP said are disguised as development oriented. Mr Mohamed also accused Mr Ruto of being insincere about his recent frequent visits to Migori County. He said Mr Ruto was taking advantage of the handshake between ODM party leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta to popularise his 2022 presidential bid. Mr Mohamed said the DP should not pretend that he takes development to Nyanza whenever he visits. According to Mr Kitayama, who is coordinating the visit, the DP will be in the region to "fulfil his promise of officially opening the college" besides helping to fundraise. In Nyamira, he will launch the Kemera-Kiendege-Eberege-Gachuba-Keumbu road before heading to Nyabururu Catholic Church for a fundraiser. MPs Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba) and Richard Onyonka (Kitutu Chache South) will host him.   ODM politicians claim Ruto is not sincere about his development talk.
