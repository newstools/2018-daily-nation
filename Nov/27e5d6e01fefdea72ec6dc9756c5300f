Parliament, as the premier institution in which representatives of the people from across the country make laws, must conduct its business beyond reproach. This is precisely why the MPs enjoy the honorific title of “Honourable”. It conveys a certain amount of respect and it’s only fair that the holders of this position, be they elected or nominated, reciprocate by conducting themselves with a high sense of decorum. The current Parliament risks sinking to the lowest point ever witnessed in the five decades that this democratic institution has presided over the affairs of the nation. The MPs are leaders in their constituencies and also at the national level, being part of the elite group that shapes the destiny of the nation. BRIBE And yet Parliament’s dignity has been badly battered in recent days with allegations that some MPs were bribed to shoot down a report in the House. And most humiliating is the claim that the bribes were handed out to the recipients in the toilet. If confirmed, this would be the worst descent into muck that has been witnessed in recent years. Indeed, the dignity of this August House is at stake. And whether it’s true or false, the mere fact that aspersions have been cast on the conduct of some MPs is damning enough. PROBE We fully agree with the proposal to have the Directorate of Criminal Investigation and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission investigate the 10 MPs who claimed that their colleagues were bribed. But even more importantly, these MPs should be required to provide any evidence they may have on the bribery allegations. The image of the House has been tarnished and the sooner this matter is meticulously investigated and the truth established the better. It’s in the interest of Parliament to demonstrate its commitment to decency and moral uprightness.
