Police in Nanyuki are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a journalist, Ms Becky Gitu, whose body was retrieved from River Nanyuki in Laikipia County on Tuesday. Ms Gitu was in the company of her friends when she allegedly slipped and fell into the river on Monday night. According to Laikipia County Police Commander Simon Kipkeu, the two friends did not report the incident immediately, but instead filed a missing person report the following day. However, an investigation officer gave a conflicting report, saying the two women reported the incident the same night only that police could not launch a rescue operation because it was dark yet the station is about 100 metres from the bridge. Mr Kipkeu did not respond to Nation calls to clarify the conflicting report. The police commander said the three were seen having drinks at the Nanyuki Police Station canteen and left together at around 10.40pm. “When they arrived at the bridge, one of the ladies miscalculated the steps and landed into the river. The friends did not report to police immediately,” he said. He added that the body did not have injuries. According to the officers, the body was retrieved about 200 metres from where she fell off. Her relatives viewed the body at the Nanyuki Referral Hospital Mortuary on Wednesday and visited the death scene. The police have recorded statements of the two women who were with the journalist as investigations continue.
