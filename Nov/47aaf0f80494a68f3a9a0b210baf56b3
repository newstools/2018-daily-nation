Police in Machakos are investigating the murder of a brother of Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Nicholas Mutuku. Mr Timothy Mbithi Mutuku was ambushed on his way home on the evening of October 21 and hit on the back of the head with a blunt object. His body was discovered by neighbours the next morning on the road leading to his home in Mwala, about 80 metres from Itukani market, a small shopping centre he had visited on the fateful day. Nothing was stolen from the 66-year-old, and detectives are yet to arrest any suspects or establish the motive of the killing. MOTIVE According to Mwala OCPD Henry Kimathi, Mr Mbithi died from the injury caused by the blow to his head. Mr Mutuku, a senior State counsel and deputy DPP in charge of county affairs, told the Nation that his brother's killing had puzzled the family, but believes it has nothing to do with his work. "Obviously, we were shocked by the murder of our brother. There is nothing so far to suggest that it is connected to my work but we hope the police will unravel the motive and bring the killers to book," he said. Mr Mutuku said his brother did not have any known disagreement with anyone, which could be linked to his death.
