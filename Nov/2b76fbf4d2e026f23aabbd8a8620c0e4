The embattled Migori Governor Okoth Obado on Monday hosted Deputy President William Ruto in Nyanza where the latter is seeking to make inroads. The Deputy President said the Jubilee administration, which has had warm relations with the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) since the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga on March 9 this year, will initiate development projects in the opposition stronghold. "We want to build one united country without political or tribal bias," Mr Ruto said at the Maranatha Church Assembly in Migori town. Mr Ruto said he will make more development tours in Nyanza region and pledged to return to Migori County in February next year to conduct a fundraised for all the churches in the region. The Deputy President spent Sunday night at the Rusinga Lodge in Homa Bay County after spending the weekend in Western Kenya where he presided over several public functions. Previously, Mr Ruto only visited Kisii, Nyamira, Kuria West and Kuria East, the only Nyanza areas that in the past leaned towards Jubilee Party. But all the ODM lawmakers from the region gave Mr Rutoâ€™s event a wide berth with only Kuria West MP Matthias Robi and his Kuria East counterpart Maisori Kitayana attending.   The prosecution terminated the cases, citing witness interference.
