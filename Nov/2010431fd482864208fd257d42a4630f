Nasa wants MPs affiliated to the coalition to continue remitting a Sh10,000 monthly fee directly to the Secretariat. Through lawyer Arnold Oginga, Nasa Thursday filed a case before the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal seeking the suspension of a letter written by National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi directing MPs to channel their contribution to individual parties. Nasa CEO Norman Magaya said the move has denied the coalition funds to run its affairs such as paying rent, salaries for its staff and meeting daily expenses. The letter dated October 15, 2018 and addressed to National Assembly Clerk Michael Sialai stated that the remittances to Nasa accounts should stop and that amounts deducted from the MPs should be channelled to individual parties. The parties in the coalition are ODM, Wiper, Ford-Kenya and Amani National Congress. They entered an agreement on February 22, 2017, and registered at the Registrar of Political Parties. Mr Magaya said Nasa is entitled to receive the funds and use them in accordance with the coalition agreement. The Tribunal certified the case as urgent and directed the parties to negotiate with a view of settling the dispute out of court. The case will be heard on November 22.
