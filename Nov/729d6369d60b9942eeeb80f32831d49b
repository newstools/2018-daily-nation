Vihiga United has parted ways with eight players as they continue rebuilding ahead of the upcoming Kenyan Premier League season. Goalkeeper Barnabas Tiema and Ugandan defender Jonathan Mugubi are some of the biggest casualties in the list that also has Soita Silicho, Morven Otinya, Vitalis Okumu, Ali Kesi, Bernard Ogot and Vincent Kagasi. The Vihiga-based side endured a tough debut season in the top tier that saw them escape relegation on the last day of the 2018 season with a 2-0 win over Nakumatt on October 7 to finish 12th with 41 points. “We declined to renew their contracts because of various reasons including non performance while others were on loan in the team,” said Vihiga County Government Public Relations Officer (PRO) Peter Atsiaya adding that registration of new players is ongoing. “The recruitment process is very competitive. Many players from KPL Clubs turned up to be considered but we can’t take all of them,” added Atsiaya during the team's training session at the Kidundu Stadium. According to Atsiaya, the technical bench led by head coach Mike Mururi was given a free hand to handle the recruitment process. The new signings will be unveiled next week. Meanwhile, Vihiga United FC have changed their home ground from Mumias Sports Complex to Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega. Atsiaya said they will play all their home matches at Bukhungu in their second season in the topflight. The club, which is sponsored by the County Government of Vihiga, will use Mumias Sports Complex as an alternative home ground. “The team has been moved to Bukhungu stadium because it’s a modern facility which successfully hosted the Council of East and Central Africa Football Association (CECAFA) tourney last year,” he noted. The move will certainly be welcomed by fans of the club due to the proximity of Bukhungu compared to Mumias. Bukhungu is also the home ground of Kakamega Homeboyz.
