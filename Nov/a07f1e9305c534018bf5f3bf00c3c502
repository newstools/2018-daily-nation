The Supreme Court has expunged two affidavits filed by Kampala International University confirming that Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi was a graduate of the institution. In their decision on Wednesday, judges of the top court in the land said the affidavits were filed out of time. The documents were sworn by Kampala International University’s founding vice chancellor Badru Dungu Katerega and the Academic Registrar Hamza Segawa. UGANDA The two had said Mr Abdi was a student at the university between 2009 and 2012. Last month, Uganda refuted claims by Mr Mohamud that he studied at university. Uganda's Ministry of Internal Affairs said Mr Abdi never travelled to the country at the time he claims to have been studying. “We have established no record of travel into and out of Uganda during the said period … as per the details provided in the letter,” Ms Lynette Bridget Boganza, for the Internal Affairs Permanent Secretary, said in an October 22 communication. Mr Abdi's election was nullified because of irregularities and because he does not possess a degree, a requirement for a governor's position. His appeal was equally dismissed by the Court of Appeal but he moved to the Supreme Court and obtained orders stopping IEBC from declaring the seat vacant pending his appeal.
