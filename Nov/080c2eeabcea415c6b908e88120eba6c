Former Kirimari ward representative aspirant was on Friday charged with trafficking bhang worth Sh290,000. Mr Dennis Mbae Mutegi denied the charges before Embu Resident Magistrate Juliana Ndengeri and was released on a Sh300,000 bond with two sureties of similar amount. He is accused of trafficking 13 kilogrammes of bhang in Embu West. The court heard that, during a raid led by Administration Police Eastern regional boss Joseph Chepkeitany, a Toyota Probox was also seized. Police found 50 stones of local bhang stuffed in a suitcase and half a sack of a variety reportedly sourced from Ethiopia. They also found Sh5,100, two weighing machines, a book with names and contacts of people suspected to be peddlers. Ms Ndengeri ordered the prosecution to provide Mr Mbae with witness statements and details of the exhibits they will be relying on in the case. The case will be mentioned on November 29.
