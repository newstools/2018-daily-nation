Security agencies have killed four Al-Shabaab terrorists and recovered six AK-47 rifles in Ijara on the border of Lamu and Garissa counties. The officers from the by Rapid Border Patrol Unit (RBPU) are part of the ongoing multi-agency security Operation Linda Boni meant to flush out Al-Shabaab militants believed to be hiding inside the dense Boni Forest. Confirming the incident on Monday, Linda Boni Operation Director Joseph Kanyiri said a number of ammunitions were also recovered in the 11pm Sunday incident. SAFARICOM MAST Mr Kanyiri said the militants had attacked a Safaricom communications mast in Ijara but officers engaged them in a fire fight that saw four of the terrorists killed. “Last night at around 11pm, Border Patrol Unit officers serving in Boni Forest thwarted an Al-Shabaab terrorists attack against Ijara Safaricom mast. BPU officers engaged the Al-Shabaab in a fire fight that saw four terrorists killed, six AK-47 rifles and a number of ammunitions recovered,” said Mr Kanyiri. He said Al-Shabaab terrorists have been making futile attempts at destroying communication masts, particularly in Lamu and Garissa counties, with the main objective being to cripple communication networks in the region. INJURED Mr Kanyiri said security organs in the area are in hot pursuit of other terrorists believed to have escaped with multiple injuries. “Some terrorists have escaped with injuries during the fire fight. I therefore appeal to members of the public in the area to report to security organs any suspicious characters with bullet wounds or unexplained injuries,” said Mr Kanyiri. He said operations to mop up Al-Shabaab elements in the area will continue until security and peace is guaranteed. The killing of the four terrorists comes barely three months after ten Al-Shabaab militants were killed in Taksile, north of Pandanguo in Lamu County.   Koreni village is home to over 600 residents, mostly herders from the Somali community.
