Police in Bomet are looking for three men who are accused of gang-raping a Form Three student. A fourth suspect was arrested on Thursday and is expected to be arraigned in court on Monday. Police say the 17-year-old girl was lured into the house of one of the suspects, who allegedly invited the others. One of the suspects recorded the crime on phone and shared the audio on social media. In the three minute-long viral audio, the girl is heard pleading for mercy from the men who appeared to be well known to her. Residents took to social media to condemn the incident. “The pain the girl underwent is too much to fathom. It is not enough to arrest and put the suspects behind bard, but for the courts to ensure maximum sentence is meted to the suspects,” said Mike Koskei.
