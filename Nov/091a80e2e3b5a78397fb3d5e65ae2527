Strathmore University's Swords qualified for the women's Kenya Basketball Federation Premier League play-offs semi-finals after they eliminated stubborn Zetech University 2-1 in the quarter-final at Nyayo National Stadium Indoor Gymnasium on Sunday. Strathmore defeated Zetech University 53-47 in the decisive Game Three to advance to the semi-final on a 2-1 basis of the best-of-three series quarter-finals. After having won Game One 52-50, Zetech recovered to win Game Two 52-45 on Saturday to lock the series 1-1. Sunday's make-or-break Game Three was to break the tie and determine who joins champions Kenya Ports Authority, Equity Bank and Storms in the last four. Zetech still proved to be a hard nut to crack when forward Maureen Bosibori, Cynthia Mawero and Deedee Were fired three-pointers which steered their team to a 14-10 lead at end of first quarter. Strathmore had fighting Clara Rotich and Joy Mupalia struggling to cut down the scores without any luck as Zetech raced to another deserved 16-9 run at end of second quarter. Zetech led 30-19 at the breather. Swords coach Ronnie Owino, a Fiba-Africa Instructor, used the half-time break to reorganise his charges. Edna Kola was their secret weapon scoring 11 points while Clara Rotich also scored two three-pointers for a 23-13 score in the third quarter; a result which turned the game in their favour. Strathmore completed their comeback in the fourth quarter registering 11-4 to seal the remaining semi-finals slot. Edna Kola shot 15 points for Strathmore, who will now take on Fiba Africa Zone V Club champions Equity Bank in the semis. Hardworking Maureen Bosibori replied with 15 points through five three-pointers for the losers. "We had focused to reach the semi-finals which is a big achievement because we are a young team with a bulk of inexperienced first year students fresh from high school. We respect our semi-final opponents Equity Bank who have nine international players but we don't fear them," said Owino.
