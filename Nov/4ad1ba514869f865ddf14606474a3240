A squatter allegedly killed retired judge Effie Owuor's farm manager and injured her son in an attack in Muhoroni, Kisumu County, on Saturday. Kisumu County Commissioner Pauline Dola said the suspect went into hiding immediately after the incident at about 1pm. BORDER TENSION The farm manager was identified as Mr George Benjo. Ms Owuor's son, whose name was not established immediately, was taken to Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu. Ms Dola said they were working with police in Nandi County to find the suspect. She said other officers were sent to the Kisumu-Nandi border to prevent chaos that might result from the incident. “We understand the suspect is well known. Police are on the ground looking for him and we have deployed more officers to the border to help with the search and ensure peace prevails," the commissioner said. GANG CLAIMS Ms Dola said the suspect and the farm manager had feuded. Residents, however, claimed the suspect is a hardcore criminal and that he and five others waylaid Mr Benjo at the farm and cut him several times. They said the judge's son ended up seriously injured as he responded to the farm manager’s screams. “He is member of a gang that encroaches on peoples’ land. He attacked the farm manager with his five colleagues," a resident claimed. Ms Owuor retired as judge of the Court of Appeal after 33 years. She was the first female State counsel, magistrate, High Court judge and Court of Appeal judge. She currently chairs the Sexual Offence Taskforce.   Retired judge Effie Owuor has been nominated to the bench of the International Criminal Court.
