Cash-starved State corporation the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) has sacked over 80 workers at its Athi River-based factory’s production department for allegedly participating in a go-slow over the past two days. The workers were issued with interdiction letters on Wednesday and blocked from accessing the company by a contingent of armed police officers. The company’s management gave stern instructions to its security team not to allow any of the interdicted workers into the company. After three weeks of non-operation the first batch of 120 cows arrived for slaughter at the factory on Monday this week. The workers however went on a go-slow downing their tools to the chagrin of the management. The protesting staffers have since camped at the firm’s entrance demanding to be allowed back so as to resume their duties. A letter from KMC dated November 27 written to affected workers and signed by its managing commissioner James Ole Serian states that they had been dismissed for misconduct. The letter is titled ‘interdiction pending investigations into gross misconduct.’ “It has been noted by the Commission that you have engaged in the following actions and/or omissions, which are offences that contribute to Gross Misconduct as prescribed in Clause 14.4.19 of the Kenya Meat Commission Human Resource Policy, Regulations and Procedures Manual as well as Clause 17 (a) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.” The workers however said they were being victimised for participating in the go-slow. They said they had downed their tools since Monday demanding answers on their gratuity, pay increment, and Collective Bargaining Agreement. “We’re being victimised for demanding our rights. We have been suffering for years since the company was revived in 2006. We demand Agriculture Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to intervene,’’ said Wyclife Kibet, one of the sacked workers.   Poor animal breeds, high cost of feeds and treatment have dampened the multibillion-shilling dairy industry.
