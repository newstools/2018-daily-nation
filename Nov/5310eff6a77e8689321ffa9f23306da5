Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has said the government will not back down on enforcement of 'Michuki rules' despite many matatu operators withdrawing their services in protest. "They can keep their vehicles at home. We will not relent," said Mr Matiang'i on Monday. Many commuters who rely on public service vehicles across the country had to choose alternative means of transport as drivers kept off the roads to avoid their vehicles being seized by the police for not complying with traffic law. To cushion passengers who have been hit by increased fares, the government ordered Kenya Railways Corporation to increase the number and frequency of commuter trains on all routes. Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia directed he corporation to also reduce fares by 10 percent. "As the government continues to enforce the traffic law to improve road safety and management of the sector, the public is requested to support the government efforts in order to realise the long-term benefits for all Kenyans," said Mr Macharia in a statement published on his Twitter page. Many Kenyans across the country had to look for alternative means of transport on Monday as public service vehicles went on strike over the enforcement of the "Michuki rules". Those who could not afford alternative means such as boda bodas and mobile taxis either hitched rides on private cars or trekked to work. The move, which is meant to mitigate the shortage of matatus, is likely to benefit only a handful of city residents since many rely on public service vehicles. Speaking to journalists at the railway station in Nairobi, Mr Macharia said matatus that hiked fares and those that kept off the roads will be punished. The Cabinet secretary said that the number of trains will be increased from 12 to 18 and will run from the Kikuyu, Ruiru and Embakasi stations.
