World Cross Country mixed relay gold medallist Winfred Mbithe up on Saturday won women's 10km race during the Athletics Kenya Cross Country Series first leg in Machakos. Mbithe was declared the winner despite having finished the race with one lap to go. This is after confusion reigned when an official let in Mbithe even after coming to the bell. Mbithe way ahead of the chasing pack with over 200m lead only for the official to open the tape near the finish to let her in. With Mbithe not aware of what was happening, went to change only to realise that her rivals were still going on with the race. Eventually, it's Nyahururu's Mary Nyaruai who came in first in 36:07.4 followed by compatriot Mary Njau in 36:26.7. Kenya Navy's Jarinta Mawia settled third in 36:37.8. Coaches of the top seven finishers including Nyahururu's Francis Kamau, Kenya Navy's Michael Kiptum and Benjamin Itok of Police met and agreed to hand Mbithe victory because she was far much ahead of the race before she was misled by the official. Meet referee Philip Ngovi said it's unfortunate the hiccup happened but an amicable solution was arrived at. "Mbithe looked comfortable and destined for victory and the coaches unanimously agreed to hand her the win. You only give the athlete the benefit of doubt," said Ngovi.   Anyango's dream now is to go on and win at the Nationals.
