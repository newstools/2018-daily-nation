State House Comptroller Kinuthia Mbugua visited retired President Daniel arap Moi at his Kabarak home on Saturday, amid speculation about his role in succession politics. Mr Mbugua visited a day after Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka and other officials of his party. COMFORT Mr Moi’s Press secretary Lee Njiru said that Mr Mbugua, a former Nakuru County Governor, visited to review operations in the office of the retired president. “Mr Mbugua and Mzee Moi’s talks focused on areas that needed improvement,” Mr Njiru in a statement. The comptroller has also served as a district commissioner in Nakuru under the retired president. Mr Mbugua noted that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration will continue to prioritise Mr Moi's comfort. He delivered a goodwill message from President Kenyatta. SEVERAL VISITS Several high profile politicians have visited Mr Moi at his home. They include the president, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and some politicians from the vote-rich Rift Valley region. A surprise visit by President Kenyatta left South Rift residents guessing what it implies for Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. The DP is the only top politician who is yet to pay Mr Moi a courtesy call. Mr Ruto visited Mr Moi early in May but failed to meet him. Sources privy to the visit said the retired president could not meet Mr Ruto as he was undergoing a routine physiotherapy session with his doctors for the entire duration of the visit. With the succession battle gathering momentum by the day, Mzee Moi and his son Gideon Moi, who is Kanu's national chairman and Baringo senator, will continue to receive such visitors. The senator is among politicians intending to compete to take over from President Kenyatta in the next general election.   Former president is increasingly becoming a major player in post-Uhuru realignment.
