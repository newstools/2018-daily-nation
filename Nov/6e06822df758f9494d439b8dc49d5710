Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) materials worth more than Sh1 million have been recovered at the home of Naro Moru member of county assembly (MCA) Martin Matu. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) reported this via Twitter on Sunday morning, identifying the materials as several rolls of Geogrid. SUMMONS The DCI reported that the items had been stolen from the Nairobi SGR Yard. "The MCA has been instructed to report to DCI Railways on Monday," it said. In May 2017,  President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to protect the SGR by all means — including authorising the execution of vandals. While launching the passenger train on the Sh327 billion railway in Mombasa County, Mr Kenyatta noted that he has powers to authorise implementation of the death penalty. He said the project should be continued by successive governments because it is a vision for the people of Kenya. “It is not mine,” said the Head of State. “It doesn’t belong to (Deputy President) William (Ruto). It is for all Kenyans.” DENIAL Reached for comment by the Nation, Mr Matu denied the report that the materials were recovered at his home. He said they were found in his neighbourhood. The ward representative also said he had not received any instructions to report to the DCI. "Nobody has told me to report to the DCI. I am getting these reports from people," he said.
