Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has decried the high number of teenage pregnancies reported during this year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examinations. The CS on Thursday ordered the quality assurance team in the Education ministry to investigate and file a report of all cases of pregnancies among school girls. The CS noted that the move will enable the ministry to outline measures to curb such cases. REPORT “In the last three days, we have received a report of nine girls who have given birth during the exam period. We are yet to get a final report,” said Ms Mohamed. The minister urged parents to instil good discipline in their children through guidance and counselling to ensure such incidents are prevented. “It is the responsibility of parents to talk to their children and ensure that they do not engage in sexual relations at a tender age,” she said. Ms Mohamed spoke at Lang'ata Women’s Prison, where three prisoners wrote the last papers. She was accompanied by Kenya National Examination Council Chief Executive Officer Mercy Karogo. CHEATING She said the ministry will ensure a 100 percent transition from primary to secondary school next year. She also visited four candidates at Kenyatta National Hospital, among them three girls who gave birth during the exam period. Ms Mohamed further said no cases of cheating were reported during this year’s exams. She said two suspects who were arrested in Narok County on Wednesday after they disappeared with exam papers were taken to court and action would be taken against them.   This is the first such case to be reported in Kwale County this year.
