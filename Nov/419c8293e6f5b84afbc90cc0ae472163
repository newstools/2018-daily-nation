At least 47 passengers escaped unhurt after a Mombasa-bound bus caught fire on Tuesday evening. The bus belonging to Tahmeed Coach Ltd went up in flames on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway in Manyani, Taita Taveta County. Taita Taveta police boss Michael Mureithi said the bus which was heading to Mombasa from Nairobi caught fire at around 5pm. He said all the passengers managed to escape before the bus burst into flames. “The bus did not have an emergency fire extinguisher and it was reduced to ashes,” he said. Mr Mureithi said the cause of the fire was not immediately established but police have opened investigations into the incident. This is the second Tahmeed bus to go up in flames this year.
