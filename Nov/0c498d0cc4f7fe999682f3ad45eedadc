President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered the Fisheries department and the National Land Commission (NLC) to recover and secure all fish landing sites in Kenya. The president noted on Monday that many of the sites and other public properties are in the wrong hands as they were acquired illegally by private developers. COAST GUARD Mr Kenyatta wants all the assets returned to the government by April 2019. “I direct the fisheries department and the NLC to use the full force of the law to ensure all the fish landing sites at the Coast, in Lake Victoria, Lake Turkana and indeed any other lakes and rivers are recovered and secured by the end of the first quarter of 2019,” said President Kenyatta. Mr Kenyatta issued the directive at the Liwatoni Fisheries Complex in Mombasa County, during the launch of the Kenya Coast Guard Service and their Mv Doria vessel. He added, “I thank one of the private developers who voluntarily gave this site (Liwatoni) back to the government. The remaining ones ... we will not wait for you to give them back. We will recover them." The coast guard will be headed by Brigadier Victor Naisho Loonena. It comprises personnel from the police, army and intelligence services and civilian professionals seconded from the Public Service Commission. The president noted that its goals are to enhance maritime security and protect Kenya's resources. He further said that his government is committed to reviving the lost glory of the blue economy. Its contribution to the country’s gross domestic product, he noted, is a "mere 2.5 percent yet we can do three times better with full exploits".   Launch aimed at ending aggression and illegal commercial activities at sea.
