Bandari will play two friendly matches against top Zanzibar clubs, Jeshi la Kujenga Uchumi (JKU) and Malindi, this weekend. The Mombasa based side arrived in Zanzibar on Thursday for their four-day preseason camp that is fully sponsored by their main sponsors, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), in appreciation for the team’s historic second place finish in the past SportPesa Premier League (SPL) campaign. Bandari FC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Edward Oduor confirmed that they arrived in Zanzibar safely and were received well by the local football officials who helped them organise the two friendlies. Oduor thanked the Zanzibar Football Association (ZFA) officials for their warm reception and allowing them the usage of Amaan Stadium for their training sessions and for the two matches. "We thank the ZFA who have agreed to organise the two friendly matches against JKU and Malindi. We are so impressed with the way they are handling us,” he said. The veteran football administrator said prior to leaving Mombasa on Thursday they got official permission from the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) allowing them to play two friendly matches during their stay in Zanzibar Island. The Dockers will play reigning Zanzibar champions JKU on Saturday morning before taking to the pitch again on Sunday afternoon to face three-time champions Malindi.
