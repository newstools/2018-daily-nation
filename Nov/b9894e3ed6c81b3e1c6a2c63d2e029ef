Migori Governor Okoth Obado was on Thursday morning taken to Kibera Law Courts following his arrest after eight guns were found in his homes and office. Mr Obado was ushered into an empty court room, before Chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani, and the doors shut. Security was tight.   DETENTION The county chief was arrested on Wednesday for questioning by officers of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). This was after the firearms were found in raids by officers of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). Mr Obado is accused of using proxies, among them his relatives, to siphon Sh2 billion from the coffers of the county government, according to an affidavit filed in court by the EACC. Police want the governor held for 15 days for investigations into these allegation. Before Ms Gandani, the defence team opposed the State's application for Mr Obado's further detention, saying it was malicious. The court adjourned briefly for the prosecution to brief the defence, which includes lawyer Cliff Ombeta. The magistrate will rule on whether Mr Obado should be freed or detained further. RAIDS The EACC officers confiscated eight firearms, several bank statements and electronics from the county chief's houses and office. Five of the firearms were found in Nairobi and three in Migori, sources said. DCI boss George Kinoti said the firearms will be subjected to ballistic examinations and verification of certificates at the Central Firearms Bureau. Mr Obado is accused of using proxies, among them his relatives, to siphon Sh2 billion from the coffers of the county government, according to an affidavit filed in court by the anti-corruption watchdog. He is also facing murder charges in the case of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno, who was his girlfriend.   Eight guns were recently found in his homes during a raid by officials from EACC.
