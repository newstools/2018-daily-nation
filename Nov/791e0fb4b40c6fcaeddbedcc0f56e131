Following the recent vetting of procurement and heads of accounting in ministries that was ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta in bid to stem corruption, the government has now redeployed the officers in bid to effect changes. The audit was ordered on June 5 this year following repeated calls by Kenyans for the President to take action on corruption in the wake of financial scandals at agencies including the National Cereals and Produce Board, National Youth Service, Kenya Pipeline Company and Kenya Power. President Kenyatta had ordered the state officials to undergo fresh vetting and take polygraph tests to determine their suitability and integrity. Further, the officers were instructed  to submit their personal information to the office of the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua which aided investigation on how they acquired their wealth. Through a letter signed by Treasury Permanent Secretary PS Kamau Thugge on November 7, the government redeployed heads of accounting units and their deputies. Here is the full list of those deployed as heads of accounting and deputies in various ministries:   The chairman of the Council of Governors, Mr Peter Munya, said he would call an extra-ordinary governors meeting to address corruption.
