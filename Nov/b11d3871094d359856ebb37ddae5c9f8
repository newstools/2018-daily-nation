Two suspects have been charged with gang-raping a form three student in Bomet County on November 5. They allegedly attacked the 17-year-old Kongotik Sub-location in Bomet East Sub-county after an accomplice lured her into his house. ASSESSMENT The two faced another charged of touching the girl inappropriately. Suspect Dennis Kiplangat Koech denied the charge before Bomet Senior Resident Magistrate Kipkirui Kibelion. The magistrate ordered that the second suspect undergo an age assessment at Longisa County Referral Hospital and the report be tabled in court on Monday afternoon. Mr Kibelion’s directive followed a claim by the suspect, during plea-taking, that he was 16 years old. The report on the assessment is to be tabled in court by close of business on Tuesday. Public Prosecutor Mark Barasa urged the court to defer bond determination as the victim wished to make a presentation before the magistrate. “Some new evidence has emerged in relation to the case, including an electronic recording that is currently being analysed,” stated Mr Barasa. “I also need to get in touch with the investigating officer before the bond issue is determined by the court." The magistrate directed the prosecution to provide the accused with all documents to be used as evidence. RECORDING Independent investigations found that a youth secretly recorded an audio as his village mates raped the girl. He released it a few hours later and is helping police with investigations. It is expected that the man will be a state witness in the case. In the three-minute viral audio, the girl is heard pleading for mercy from men who seem well-known to her. It emerged that one of the suspects is a known boda boda rider who invited her to his house and then called the others.   Police hunt for three suspects accused of gang-raping a Form Three student.
