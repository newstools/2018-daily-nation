One person has been killed and two others seriously injured in renewed inter -clan clashes in Qara, Wajir County. Wajir County Police Commander Stephen Ng’etich confirmed the incident, saying the two clans, Matan and Geleble, engaged in fierce gunfight after falling out on a joint new settlement in Gara Bisik. The county police boss said reinforcements have been deployed to the area to end the fighting. The two injured victims are receiving treatment at Arbajahan Hospital while the body of the deceased has been taken to Griftu Sub-County Hospital mortuary. Mr Ng’etich said elders and a section of leaders are holding peace talks to settle the land dispute. This incident comes a week after Geleble clan elders expressed concern over a 12-day eviction notice from Garsekoftu settlement, a move they claimed was meant to intimidate them. In an earlier visit to the county last month, North Eastern Regional Coordinator Mohamed Birik said that no new settlements will be allowed in the county.   Birik says not even politicians will be spared in the fight for peace.
