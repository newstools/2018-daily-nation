Bandari put up a good show to register a 3-1 victory over reigning Zanzibar Premier League champions Jeshi la Kujenga Uchumi (JKU) in a friendly match at the Amaan Stadium on Saturday. The Dockers, who dominated both halves, opened the scoring at the stroke of half time through their Most Valuable Player last season Abdalla Hassan after being fed by Siraj Mohamed. Wycliffe Ochomo stepped off the bench to settle the tie as a contest with a second half brace. He expertly converted from the spot in the 58th minute after Shaban Kenga was appended in the box. The burly forward completed his brace 12 minutes later when he connected to Hamisi Mwinyi's cross to score from close range. JKU got their consolation through Faki “Chui” Abdulai in the 84th minute. Bandari team manager Wilson Oburu was impressed by the result given it was their first friendly since they started preseason training. “There were some minor mistakes which I hope the head coach Bernard Mwalala will work on. We are not worried as the players have started showing some cohesion,” said Oburu. He also expressed joy following the return of Collins Agade from a long injury layoff. “I hope Agade will continue to do well and play more matches in the coming season,” said Oburu. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Edward Oduor said their match against JKU was very competitive and they expect the same when they meet three-time Zanzibar Premier League champions Malindi in their second friendly on Sunday. “We will take on Malindi FC from 9am in a match expected to be televised live,” said Oduor. Bandari FC is in Zanzibar for a four-day training camp courtesy of their main sponsor Kenya Ports Authority.
