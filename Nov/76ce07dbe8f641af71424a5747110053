The Judiciary came under fire from politicians and relatives of former Nairobi Town Clerk John Gakuo during his burial in Rurii village, Nyandarua County. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, Nominated MP Maina Kamanda, Nyandarua Woman Rep Faith Gitau and County Assembly Speaker Ndegwa Wahome said Mr Gakuo would still be alive had he been granted bail. Mr Sonko said inefficiency in the Judiciary makes suspects resort to other means to remain free. “I escaped from prison to bury my mother when a magistrate denied me bail,” the city county boss said. The leaders said Mr Gakuo deserved bail, “given his age, health status and service to the nation”. Mr Simon Makallah, Mr Gakuo’s in-law, said the former Town clerk was a senior citizen who served his country well. “Gakuo was almost 70 and was not a flight risk,” Mr Makallah said. Mr Wahome said lawyers would pursue justice for Mr Gakuo and his family.   John Gakuo's lawyer confirms death, says body taken to mortuary.
