After more than a week of searching, Flying Squad detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations finally arrested quack doctor James Mugo alias Mugo wa Wairimu Tuesday evening. The officers pounced on Mr Mugo in Gachie as he moved from one hideout to another, ending a long search that saw the detectives move from estate to estate in Kiambu and Nairobi. The officers had searched Kayole, Kiambu, Dagoretti, Tena, Kasarani and Gachie for Mr Mugo whose illegal clinic was exposed in an NTV investigative piece last week. Head of Flying Squad Musa Yego said the police arrested the suspect at 7pm. “We will arraign him at the Milimani Law Courts Wednesday,” Mr Yego said without divulging details of their nine-day search. Mr Mugo is being detained at Pangani Police Station.   Mugo wa Wairimu’s mother and father rush to defence of their son
