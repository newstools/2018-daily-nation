Chiefs and their assistants have been assigned the tough task of pointing out criminals following clashes in Wajir County that have left at least four dead. They were given this task on Friday when politicians and a security team visited the troubled Garsekoftu settlement in a bid to restore peace. TENSION Fighting began after the Matan and Geleble clans disagreed on a new settlement in Gara Bisik. A 50-year-old man died so a clan retaliated, killing three people from the opposing side. The tension that resulted has forced some residents to flee in fear of more conflict. Leaders who visited the area included Governor Mohamed Abdi, Wajir East lawmaker Rashid Kassim, Wajir West's Ahmed Kolosh and County Commissioner Loyford Kibaara. They made several stopovers in settlements and urged peace among members of the two clans. WARNINGS The commissioner warned that chiefs and their chiefs will be held responsible for the violence. “There is no chief or assistant chief who is not aware of happenings in his area of jurisdiction, therefore I task them with pointing out the killers for the law to take its course,” he said He added that the government will not spare any culprits, not even if they politicians or if they hold other positions of leadership. Mr Kibaara further warned those with firearms against keeping them as they will be punished. While reporting that 13 guns were used in the first attack and eight in another one, he asked residents to surrender the weapons to authorities before the government begins disarmament. The commissioner also warned the people against spreading false information, saying it makes matters worse. He promised them calm, saying security had been boosted in all troubled areas. His sentiments were echoed by the other leaders.   Reinforcements dispatched to end fighting as two clams heavily armed.
