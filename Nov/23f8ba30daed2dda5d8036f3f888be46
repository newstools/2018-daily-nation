A court has given Ms Violet Nzisa Katua, the wife of Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria, three days to pay Sh80,000 to an a police officer she knocked down with her vehicle two years ago. Nakuru Senior Principal Magistrate ordered Ms Katua to pay the money towards the settlement of Sh738,739 compensation she owes Ms Martha Ongaga, a police officer, she knocked with with her Toyota Land Cruiser. Ms Katua was supposed to pay monthly installments of Sh100,000 as ordered by the court on October 5. Ms Ongaga told the court that she only received Sh20,000 from Ms Katua for the month of October instead of Sh100,000. The magistrate, while issuing the directive, warned Ms Nzisa against disobeying court orders warning that she risked being punished for contempt. Ms Ongaga moved to court in 2016 seeking compensation for damages after Ms Katua knocked her while was on her way to work. The officer claimed she sustained serious injuries from the crash and admitted to Kijabe hospital for five months. The case was ruled in her favour in October last year and the court ordered Ms Katua to pay the entire amount. The case will be mentioned on November 12 to confirm compliance.
