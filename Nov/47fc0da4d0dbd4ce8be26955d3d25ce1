Kisii police are holding five male students who were found in a girls school. According to officials, the KCSE candidates from St John's Nyamagwa Boys High School sneaked into St Mary's Nyamagwa Girls High School and hid in a dormitory. County Director of Criminal Investigations James Kipsoi said two boys were arrested on Monday night while three others were arrested on Tuesday. All the schoolboys were found dressed in girls’ uniforms. Two candidates were released on police bond to allow them complete their exams. Mr Kipsoi said the boys will be charged with trespass. “They will be arraigned once they are done with their exams,” said Mr Kipsoi. Police sources said because the boys’ offense was not related to the ongoing national exams there is no need to take them to court immediately.
